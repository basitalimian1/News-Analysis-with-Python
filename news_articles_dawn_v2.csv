"Construction sector ‘amnesty plan’ extended
","January 1, 2021","			
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Thursday gave a ‘new year gift’ to those associated with the construction sector by announcing that the fixed-tax regime for them has been extended by another year till Dec 2021 and the facility of non-disclosure of source of income while making investment till June 2021. 
The prime minister also gave one-year extension to construction projects which were supposed to be completed in 2022 and now they can be completed by 2023, the last year of the five-year term of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf-led government. 
“I want to give [the construction sector] good news for the new year that we have extended the fixed tax regime to Dec 31, 2021,” the prime minister said in a live address to the nation. 
He said this had been a big demand of the construction industry which was the key to offset the negative impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the national economy. 
“It was a big demand of the construction sector that the fixed-tax regime should be extended as the facility has not been availed in a real manner due to Covid-19’s impact,” he added. 
The government had introduced the fixed tax-regime for the construction sector till Dec 31, 2020.  
Prime Minister Khan said he was happy to announce that projects worth Rs186 billion had been registered with the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to take benefit of incentives given to the construction sector in April. Other projects worth Rs116bn were in the process of registration with the FBR, he added. 
He said that Rs160bn construction projects had been launched in Punjab. “This will generate economic activities equivalent to Rs1,500bn only in Punjab and will create 250,000 jobs,” he said, adding that similar projects had also been started in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Karachi and Balochistan. 
Talking about the incentives his government had given to people, the prime minister said the government had announced packages for low-cost housing for salaried people who were previously unable to afford houses. “Its first success was the foreclosure law. For the first time in Pakistan, banks are financing houses. Banks have vowed to allocate Rs378bn for construction activity till Dec 31, 2021,” he added. 
Mr Khan said the subsidy given for low-cost housing [would remain in place] and the interest rate would not be more than five per cent on houses of five marlas and no more than 7pc for houses on 10 marlas.  
“For the first 100,000 houses that will be built [under this scheme], we have decided to give Rs300,000 per house,” he added. 
He said the date for completion of construction projects had also been extended allowing people to invest in the construction sector without disclosing the source of income. 
According to the FBR, the fixed-tax scheme is applicable to the builders and developers who opt for the scheme by registering their projects with the FBR. Builders and developers eligible for the fixed tax scheme include individuals, a company or an association of persons. 
 
Prime Minister Imran Khan has also approved the online agriculture dashboard developed by the National Security Division, which will monitor food prices and availability of commodities at the national, provincial and district levels. 
The dashboard will use authentic indicators to prevent any food crisis and will also be effective in preventing hoarding and profiteering. 
The prime minister stressed the need for urgent measures to control inflation of items such as flour, sugar and pulses and to increase exports and find local alternatives to imported items to ensure an increase in current account surplus. 
Mr Khan was chairing the first weekly meeting held to review progress of priority sectors. Special Assistant to the PM Dr Moeed Yousuf, the secretaries of ministries concerned and senior officials attended the meeting, whereas the chief secretaries of the four provinces participated via video-link. 
On the directive of Prime Minister Khan, the areas which have been given a priority status include food security, agriculture, electricity, manpower, foreign investment, privatisation, information technology and exports. 
According to PM Office, from now onwards, there will be a weekly review meeting chaired by the prime minister, where he will be given briefings on the implementation of decisions made at these meetings with special focus on each sector.",Newspaper
"People won’t pay heed to PDM protest plans: PM
","January 2, 2021","• Rubbishes opposition’s allegation of being ‘puppet’

• Calls army his subordinate institution like bureaucracy

• Says allies pursuing PTI’s manifesto
 Prime Minister Imran Khan has said people will pay no heed to the Pakistan Democratic Movement’s (PDM) call for ‘long march’ and rejected the opposition’s allegation of a ‘puppet’ premier, arguing that if it was true why he did not hold talks with them even after the military leadership had asked him to do so in order to end political instability.
In his first interview of the year with 
 on Friday, Mr Khan made it clear that Pakistan Army was his subordinate institution just as the bureaucracy was.
While reiterating that he would never give any National Reconciliation Ordinance-like relief to the opposition leaders facing corruption references, the PM said: “Pakistani nation takes to streets only against corruption and for their genuine rights, but this time they know PDM leaders are planning the long march only to save their ill-gotten money.”
Asked about the opposition’s one-month deadline before holding a long march against his government, Mr Khan said: “I can give in writing that Pakistani nation will not come out on the streets on the call of PDM.” 
Responding to another question, he said: “If I am a puppet and if the army has asked me to hold talks with the opposition then why I am not doing so.” He said if he was a puppet, why he was not making any compromise on the manifesto of ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI). “The fact is that army stands by me in implementation of my government’s manifesto. Army wants stability and progress of the country and that is why it is with me,” he said, adding that the government did not interfere in the affairs of state institutions including the army.
The prime minister in reply to another question agreed that the army had asked him to talk to the opposition to resolve political instability in the country. “I am ready to hold negotiations with opposition on important national issues. I am ready to talk but I will commit treason if I give NRO to the opposition. Whatever they (opposition) will do, I will not give them NRO,” Mr Khan declared.
Regarding PDM’s anti-government drive, the PM said since the start of PTI government, the opposition had been giving repeated deadlines for its ouster but the opposition had always failed. “The PDM has already faced humiliation in Lahore Jalsa at Minar-i-Pakistan as its leaders are not popular and the people did not come out on their call. On the other hand I filled Minar-i-Pakistan four times,” he recalled.
PM Khan reiterating his government’s resolve to uplift the people’s living standards and improve justice system and hoped that the new year 2021 would bring about good time for Pakistan. 
About frequent changes in cabinet, he explained that all the reshuffles in federal and provincial cabinets, and bureaucracy would become irrelevant on the basis of just one question whether Imran Khan had improved the lives of people after five years. “You get a mandate for five years. I will not commit to not change my team. I am the captain and always kept changing the team. I have to win the match,” he remarked.
Mr Khan announced that the government would approach the Chief Justice of Pakistan for setting up a special court to hear the corruption cases of ministers on a day-to-day basis, if any, and decide their fate within minimum possible time. He assured the nation that action would be taken against any of his ministers found involved in corruption. “I will take action. This is my ideology for 24 years. The corruption by an SHO (station house officer) or Patwari (revenue officer) disturbs the people only, but that by a prime minister or ministers destroy the country,” he said.
Referring to the opposition’s remarks against him that he had himself claimed in one of his recent speeches that he had not come to the power with complete homework, the prime minister said: “I have never called myself ill-prepared to run the government, rather I proposed at least six weeks for prior briefings by the state machinery on government affairs to a newly elected government, on the pattern of the United States.”
The prime minister said during the first two years, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government had paid back $20 billion debt, spending half of its receipts and leaving behind a limited money for public welfare.
Highlighting the government’s achievements on economic front, Mr Khan mentioned the surplus current account, increased exports, improved stock market and textile industry running at full capacity, all due to the pro-business policies.
Asked why he had made alliance with the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) even after it was accused of being involved in “criminal” activities, the PM said: “I formed a coalition with the MQM after the party had parted ways from terrorist Altaf Hussain.”
However, he said, he had already announced to never form any coalition with the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) or the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) as they would impede him in his mission of accountability and purging the country of corruption.
He claimed that the coalition partners were pursuing government’s policies and PTI’s manifesto, and rubbished the notions of any differences of his party with the Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid, MQM or Grand Democratic Alliance.",Pakistan
"Ministry to pay 30pc of circular debt to IPPs
","January 2, 2021","ISLAMABAD: In the wake of the first meeting with a delegation of the IPPs to discuss payment of circular debt and implementation of memorandums of understanding (MoUs) signed with the power producers, the government has decided to pay Rs135 billion out of Rs450bn circular debt and settle the remaining amount by the end of the current calendar year. 
Sources in the finance ministry said that a delegation of Independent Power Producers’ (IPP) managements held a meeting with Finance Minister Dr Abdul Hafeez Shaikh a day earlier to discuss the repayment plan for overdue circular debt receivables under the recently signed MoUs. 
This was the first meeting in which a workable plan was agreed by both sides. The IPP delegation termed the plan “acceptable” and the government officials said that it was affordable for the government. 
It has been agreed that of the total outstanding receivables amounting to Rs450bn, the government will pay 30 per cent now and the remaining payment will take place in equal tranches by June and December. 
Sources also said that the next round of meetings between the committee for implementation of MOUs signed with IPPs would take place on Jan 4 and 5 in Islamabad. 
The committee is led by Dr Shaikh and comprises of Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Power Tabish Gauhar, Chairman of Federal Land Commission of Pakistan Babar Yaqoob Fateh Mohammad, who had earlier led the negotiations with IPPs, secretaries of power and finance and the chief executive of Central Power Purchasing Agency. 
The meetings will finalise the amendments to the power purchase agreements based on the MoUs signed in Aug 2012. 
“The government is expected to renew the agreements with the IPPs, and it is expected to save more than Rs850 billion in the next 10 years,” an official of the finance ministry added, adding that the complete plan was likely to be finalised in several more meetings between the government and the IPPs scheduled in Jan. 
On the other hand, the scheduled payment plan will help the IPPs improve their liquidity position and expand the businesses, mainly in the coming energy sources like renewables or coal-based plants in Tharparkar. 
The official added that there were limitations for the furnace oil-based power plants, whereas there were several upcoming options in the power sector.",Newspaper
"IHC fines  govt officials Rs10m in missing  person case
","January 2, 2021","ISLAMABAD: In an unprecedented move, the Islamabad High Court on Friday imposed a fine of Rs10 million on the authorities for their failure to trace the whereabouts of a missing person.  
Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani of the IHC declared that the government functionaries responsible for the protection of citizens, including the secretaries of interior and defence, senior superintendent of police and station house officer of Golra police station, had failed to discharge their lawful function.  
He pointed out that despite several court directives they had failed to trace the whereabouts of missing person Ghulam Qadir in the last six years.  
Justice Kayani disposed of the petition filed by Qadir’s brother after imposing the fine on the authorities and warned that if they failed to recover the missing person in a month, they would face departmental inquiry.  
He regretted that the police authorities had failed to discharge their duty.  
It may be mentioned that this is the highest-ever fine imposed on the authorities in a missing person’s case. Earlier, the court had imposed a fine of Rs4m fine on the state functionaries in two similar cases.  
In August, Justice Kayani had given the authorities seven weeks for recovery of Ghulam Qadir and warned them of issuing a stern order in case of failure.  
Qadir went missing in August 2014.  
The court regretted that the citizen had been missing for the past six years but the investigation had not reached any conclusion.  
Police said the missing citizen might have gone to Afghanistan and an investigation was under way in this regard as well.",Pakistan
"Govt agrees to pay $28.7m damages to US firm
","January 2, 2021","ISLAMABAD: The federal cabinet has approved payment of 
 to the Washington-based asset recovery firm Broadsheet LLC and at the same time decided to challenge the British court’s decision to attach the accounts of the Pakistan High Commission in London. 
The approval was granted after the office of the attorney general and the law ministry advised the government to let the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) clear the $28.7m award. 
The government has also decided to fix the responsibility about the debacle on those involved in engaging the firm in 2000 during the Pervez Musharraf era, signing a controversial agreement and the payment of $5 million to a “so-called front man” of the firm. 
“The federal cabinet has given approval for payment of damages to the US-based asset recovery firm,” Adviser to the Prime Minister on Accountability Mirza Shahzad Akbar told 
, adding the government would also fix responsibility about the debacle on those involved in engaging the firm on ambiguous terms and already paying the damages amount to a “so-called representative” of the firm. 
The adviser said NAB was conducting an investigation against Tariq Malik, who is presently in Dubai, who had paid damages to the so-called front man. 
He said the agreement with the US firm was inked in 2000 and the successive governments had not pursued the case properly, with the result that Pakistan had to pay the damages to the US firm.  
“The arbitration between Pakistan and Broadsheet started during the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) government and a settlement was made by the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) government, but the money was given to the person who, according to the firm, was not its representative,” he added. 
Meanwhile, a senior NAB official said the bureau had decided to take action against those responsible for the loss and humiliation. “Some officials of NAB, other government departments and Pakistan High Commission in the UK will be under investigation,” he said, adding NAB Chairman Javed Iqbal was also holding a meeting of senior officials of the bureau to fix responsibility on those involved in the fiasco. 
An informed source told 
 that both the AG office and the law ministry had advised the government that regardless of facts of the case, the UK high court decision to debit $28.7m from the accounts of the Pakistan High Commission in London over non-payment of the penalty by NAB to the firm should be challenged. 
“This should be done to ensure that sovereign immunity accorded to Pakistan and the accounts of its high commission are respected by foreign courts and the present case should not become a precedence to be used against us,” the source added. 
“This is a sorry tale of gross mishandling by NAB and therefore they should be answerable to the people of Pakistan for this sordid saga,” he said. 
It should also be looked into how the award of $22m accumulated into $28.7m due to non-payment of interest, which incurred at a rate of $4,758 per day – an amount also compoundable after every six months, the source said. 
The clearing of the penalty was necessary to avoid further recurring of heavy interest, he said. 
Usually the accounts of high commissions, embassies and central banks were treated as sovereign assets hence they were immune from being taken over, he said. 
Referring to the role of the NAB in this fiasco, the source described the event as a perfect example of “how things should not have been done”. 
This is the second such setback to Pakistan in a row as earlier on Dec 16, 2020, the High Court of Justice in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) granted a stay order ex-parte on a plea by the Tethyan Copper Company for enforcement of July 12, 2019, $5.97 billion award against Pakistan by the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes in the Reko Diq case. 
In June 20, 2000 Pakistan initially faced a lawsuit of $580m on a dispute raised by Broadsheet LLC, a company hired for recovery of money and assets plundered by Pakistanis and invested in offshore companies. 
An agreement was signed between the firm and NAB to help recover the country’s stolen assets stashed in different offshore companies. But the dispute arose on the payment of service fees which was subsequently referred to international arbitration in London where the litigation before Arbitrator Sir Anthony Evans QC concluded in an interim award in terms of liability under Section 4 and 6 of the Recognition and Enforcement (Arbitration Agreements and Foreign Arbitral Awards) 2011. 
Under the agreement, NAB agreed to pay 20 per cent of the recovered or detected amount to the company. The bureau concluded the agreement in May 2008, paying $5m through a settlement agreement with a representative of Broadsheet. But the firm took NAB to the international court of arbitration, claiming that it had not received the amount it was supposed to. 
In Dec 2018, former English court of appeal judge Sir Anthony Evans QC issued the order for payment of $22m to Broadsheet by the government of Pakistan. In July 2019, the government filed an appeal against the order, but was unsuccessful in its bid. 
The arbitrator found that Pakistan and NAB had wrongfully repudiated the asset recovery agreement with Broadsheet and ruled that the company was entitled to damages. 
Talking to 
, former prosecutor general of NAB Irfan Qadir said the country faced defeat because the case had not been properly pursued.  
He claimed that under internationally recognised doctrine of contra proferentem, any clause considered to be ambiguous should be interpreted against the interests of the party that created, introduced or requested that the clause be included. 
Mr Qadir said the firm had inserted a clause in the contract under which it was to get a share not only in assets it will trace outside the country and also in those recoveries to be made in Pakistan by any other organisation like NAB etc.  
“The US firm had not traced even a single asset of any accused of NAB abroad but claimed its share in recoveries made inside Pakistan,” he added. 
He said the agreement was drafted by the same firm and therefore the liability of any ambiguity fell on the firm.",Newspaper
"Barbs fly in Senate over NAB’s performance
","January 2, 2021","ISLAMABAD: Tension ruled the Senate on the first day of year 2021 with senators from the two sides of the aisle locking horns over the issue of performance of the anti-corruption watchdog and process of accountability. 
During a debate on the performance of the National Accountability bureau (NAB), the opposition members rejected the process of accountability as one-sided and accused the government of using it for witch-hunt of its opponents. Members from the treasury benches responded by saying the opposition was trying to exert pressure on the government to force it to stop pursuing corruption cases against its leaders, who had amassed wealth through commissions and kickbacks, laundered money and stashed it in banks abroad. 
Some opposition senators alleged that the NAB chairman was being blackmailed to target the opposition after the leak of his “immoral audio and video clips” and he was now compelled to obey all orders “he receives through WhatsApp”. 
The senators from the government side chided the leaders of two major opposition parties. They alleged that Maryam Nawaz and Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari were struggling to save their fathers and not waging a struggle for democracy or the country. 
JUI-F leader Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haideri said NAB had become a tool in the hands of the government to victimise the opposition. “This is why Maulana Fazlur Rehman has said he will not appear before the bureau.”  
Maulana Haideri said when the government was criticised for any wrongdoing, they said the army was with them. “You cannot run the government by hiding behind the army and continuously telling lies. Why do you defame the army by dragging it in politics?” he said. 
Senator Javed Abbasi of the PML-N said the government had turned NAB into a “PTI wing”. 
He said the parliament was supreme and had to play a role in checking violation of human rights guaranteed in the constitution by any institution. 
He said there were several judgements of the Supreme Court that highlighted the role of NAB in political engineering and forcing politicians to change their loyalty. 
Mr Abbasi slammed NAB for the arrest of PML-N leader Khawaja Asif and said the bureau had failed to prove any case of assets beyond means.  
He said the parliament was being rendered irrelevant and warned that if the parliament failed to act, the rulers of today would have to face what the opposition was experiencing today.   
He objected to the law which provided for 90-day remand of an accused and admitted that it was a mistake not to revisit the accountability law when the PML-N was in power. 
He said an institution for accountability was a sine qua non for strong democracy but the process had to be transparent.  
Referring to flour, sugar and drugs scams, the PML-N senator asked why no action had been taken against those responsible for the scams. “Where are the inquiry reports?”   
He warned that the country would be heading into a blind alley if this approach was not changed. 
Speaking next, Communication Minister Murad Saeed took exception to the remarks made by Mr Abbasi saying he was threatening that the PML-N would act against the PTI leadership if the former came to power.  
He said the previous governments had not only used the anti-accountability watchdog to victimise the opposition, but also to defend their corruption. 
Mr Saeed said the Panama Papers had not been released by NAB. He said there was a 
 documentary on the Sharif family’s London properties and the 
 had also published a report on Park Lane property of the family. 
Turning his guns towards former president Asif Ali Zardari, he said fake accounts case had not been filed by Imran Khan. He said a report published in New York Times on Jan 9, 1998 had mentioned Surrey Mansion. He said there was a time when an individual was called “Mr five per cent” by international media. “When he became investment minister, funds meant for Sindh’s development went into his account and then were transferred abroad”, he said. 
Usman Kakar of the Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party said all decisions of an unconstitutional government were unconstitutional. He claimed that over a dozen people had been killed in NAB custody and said more than a week was required for a discussion on “black deeds” of the bureau. 
He demanded investigations into the assets of all generals involved in Afghan war, including Ziaul Haq, Akhtar Abdul Rehman and Hameed Gul, as well as Colonel Imam. Likewise, he said the assets of officers who had served in conflict zones -- erstwhile Fata and Balochistan -- should also be probed. He said the assets of former army chiefs Gen Pervez Musharraf and Raheel Sharif, former Inter-Services Intelligence chief Gen Ahmad Shuja Pasha and former chief justice Saqib Nisar should also be investigated. 
Mr Kakar said the Pakistan Democratic Movement would not only compel the government to resign but would also force the establishment to accept the parliament’s supremacy. “In the future, no one will be able to come to power by using the clutches of intelligence agencies,” he remarked. 
He called for enactment of a law for across-the-board accountability of all, including politicians, judges, generals and bureaucrats, and said the PTI government could not dare do so. 
Senator Kabir Mohammad Shahi also accused NAB of indulging in unprecedented political victimisation. He advised the NAB chairman to resign instead of being blackmailed. 
Senator Mohsin Aziz said the people had rejected the opposition’s narrative and the “drama of resignations” had also failed.",Pakistan
"WHO okays Pfizer vaccine for emergency use
","January 2, 2021","UNITED NATIONS: The World Health Organisation (WHO) has approved the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for emergency use, paving the way for it to be distributed to countries in need. 
It is the first vaccine to be added to the UN organisations’ Emergency Use Listing (EUL). 
Regulatory experts convened by WHO from around the world and its own teams reviewed the data on the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and found on Thursday that it met WHO’s must-have criteria for safety and efficacy with its benefits offsetting any potential risks. 
“This is a very positive step towards ensuring global access to Covid-19 vaccines,” Dr Mariangela Simao, WHO Assistant Director General for Access to Medicines and Health Products, said in a statement. 
“But I want to emphasise the need for an even greater global effort to achieve enough vaccine supply to meet the needs of priority populations everywhere.” 
The move opens the door for countries to expedite their own regulatory approval processes to import and administer the vaccine. 
It also enables Unicef and the Pan-American Health Organisation (PAHO) to procure the vaccine for distribution to countries in need. 
At the same time, WHO said it is encouraging more developers to come forward for review and assessment to satisfy the critical supply for all countries globally to stem the pandemic. 
“WHO and our partners are working night and day to evaluate other vaccines that have reached safety and efficacy standards,” Dr Simao said. 
“The vaccine is also under policy review. Drawing from WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunisation (SAGE) population prioritisation recommendations for Covid-19 vaccines, which were issued in September, the group will convene on Jan 5 to formulate vaccine specific policies and recommendations.” 
WHO is working with regional partners to advise national health authorities about the two-dose shot and its anticipated benefits. 
The World Health Organisation, the GAVI Vaccine Alliance and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations are spearheading a global effort called COVAX to secure the equitable distribution of vaccines to all countries and not just to wealthy nations. 
Meanwhile, German firm BioNTech said on Friday it was racing to ramp up production of its Covid-19 jab in Europe, to fill the “gap” left by the lack of other approved vaccines. The vaccine developed by BioNTech and its US partner Pfizer was the first to be approved in the European Union in late December. Countries including Britain, Canada and the United States okayed the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine earlier and have since also green-lighted jabs by US firm Moderna or Oxford/AstraZeneca, leaving the EU’s inoculation drive lagging behind.",Newspaper
"Pakistan urges UN to prevent Andrabi’s ‘judicial murder’
","January 2, 2021","WASHINGTON: Pakistan urged UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Friday to prevent the “judicial murder” of a Kashmiri leader and human rights activist and to persuade India to drop all “fabricated charges” against her. 
Aasiya Andrabi, who risks conviction by a sham court on Jan 18, is the founder of a Kashmiri rights group called the Dukhtaran-i-Millat, or Daughters of the Nation. 
In a letter addressed to Mr Guterres, Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the UN Munir Akram said the world must stop giving a “free pass” to India over its “systemic crackdown on the legitimate and indigenous freedom movement in Kashmir”.  
In a similar letter to UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet, Pakistan’s envoy in Geneva Ambassador Khalil Hashmi argued that the world body’s “timely intervention may help prevent miscarriage of justice”. 
The United Nations, he said, could also “assist in breaking the vicious cycle of impunity and human rights violations in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJ&K).” 
By acting on time to save Ms Andrabi, the United Nations would also “send a strong message of hope to the Kashmiri people, especially women leaders and human rights defenders”, Ambassador Hashmi wrote. 
In New York, Ambassador Akram said: “With Indian judiciary showing little proclivity to stand up for the rights of Kashmiris, there is an imminent and real threat to the life of Ms Andrabi and her associates, who are staring at a real possibility of a judicial murder.” 
In its annual report on the situation in Kashmir, a Washington-based think-tank, the US Institute of Peace noted that “Kashmir has once again emerged as a major flashpoint between South Asia’s nuclear-armed rivals, India and Pakistan.”",Newspaper

In recent months, other prominent Afghans have been ambushed by gunmen or killed in bomb attacks.
No group has yet claimed responsibility for Aimaq’s murder.
The Afghan Journalists Safety Committee, a group working for the security of journalists in the violence-wracked country, confirmed the incident.

"NSG assailed for treating Pakistan, India differently on membership
","January 2, 2021","ISLAMABAD: A senior foreign ministry official, while criticising the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) for differently treating Pakistani and Indian applications for membership, has regretted that the multilateral export control regime is politicised.  
According to a media statement issued on Friday by the Strategic Vision Institute (SVI), which hosted a webinar on “
”, the director general of the foreign ministry’s Arms Control and Disarmament Division, Kamran Akhtar, said: “NSG very much epitomises the politics of non-proliferation at the global level.”  
He accused the NSG of according “precedence to the interests of the nuclear supplier states”.  
Indian and Pakistani applications for membership have been held up at the NSG since 2016 because of their non-NPT status and differences between members over the admission criteria.  
According to Mr Akhtar, Pakistan is better qualified than India, even going by the formula proposed by Ambassador Rafael Grossi in 2016, as it does not have a mix of safeguarded and unsafeguarded facilities and has been more forthcoming in accepting legally binding commitments.  
Speaking about India, he said: “If there was an argument that mainstreaming of India would benefit the non-proliferation regime, the Indian behaviour since joining Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) belies that argument.”  
Mr Akhtar said there should not be two different standards for judging the membership applications from India and Pakistan. “Unfortunately, that’s what is happening now,” he added.  
A former official of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Dr Tariq Rauf, identified major problems and deficiencies in the export control regimes. He said the regimes did not adapt to the changing international situations and there was a lack of universality and legitimacy in them, besides having inconsistent internal implementation.  
A former permanent representative to the Conference on Disarmament and the UN in Geneva, Ambassador Zamir Akram, also noted that the working of NSG was driven by geopolitics.  
He said Pakistan’s argument had always been that there should be an equitable basis on which membership should be accorded. Pakistan also has other options like cooperation with China in civilian use of nuclear technology under the IAEA directives, he added.
SVI president Dr Zafar Iqbal Cheema said the applications by India and Pakis­tan, since 2016, had become a very cont­e­n­tious issue within the NSG as well as the outside politics which was related to it.",Newspaper
"Rashid visits Torkham, gets briefing on border security, trade facilities
","January 2, 2021","KHYBER/PESHAWAR: Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed paid his first visit to the Torkham border on Friday after assuming his new responsibilities.  
Upon arrival at the border, he was received by Khyber Rifles commandant Col Rizwan Nazir and security and district administration officials.  
The minister was briefed on border security and bilateral trade with Afghanistan. He was told that the government was trying to provide state-of-the-art facilities at the Torkham border for the local traders and transporters and increase the volume trade with Afghanistan, with special focus on promoting and patronising export of Pakistani goods.  
The interior minister said the Torkham border was backbone of the national economy as Pakistan could reach the Central Asian states through this border. He said that as per the prime minister’s vision of modernising all borders with Afghanistan, modern machines would be installed at the National Logistic Cell terminal to facilitate speedy clearance of goods and provide relief to the transporters.  
The minister was told that clearance of goods for Afghanistan would be expedited with initiation of primary inspection of goods and activation of passenger terminal, along with export and import terminals.  
Strict security measures were adopted during the interior minister’s visit to the Torkham border. He also visited the historic Khyber Rifles Mess in Landi Kotal before leaving for Peshawar.  
Talking to reporters in Peshawar, Sheikh Rashid said he would use his powers as interior minister not to renew former prime minister Nawaz Sharif’s passport after its expiry on Feb 16. He said the government was trying to bring back the former premier, but due to the absence of an extradition treaty with the United Kingdom he could not say when the PML-N supreme leader would return to the country.  
He said Pakistan started issuing online visas for 191 countries from Friday, including Afghanistan and China. He said that on the first day about 200,000 visa applications were received, which was a record in itself. He said the government had stopped issuing manual visas which would also reduce corruption in line with Prime Minister Imran Khan’s vision.  
The minister said that currently there were 528 non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in the country with billions of rupees of budget. He said the government had no issue with the NGOs doing their jobs, but would devise procedure for NOCs of those involved in politics. “We would take notice if NGOs are involved in politics,” he warned.  
He said the government had taken notice of demolition of a Hindu shrine in Karak district. He said he had taken up the issue with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Mahmood Khan and asked him to take action.  
Sheikh Rashid said the federal government had forwarded the case against JUI-F leader Mufti Kifayatullah to the KP government, adding that no one would be allowed to utter anything against the armed forces.  
He said the government had also taken notice of activities of ‘armed wings’ of political parties and they would not be allowed to operate.  
About the Pakistan Democratic Movement’s long march, the interior minister said the government would deal with the opposition in the same manner it behaved.",Pakistan

"Exports jump 18.3pc in December
","January 2, 2021","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s exports grew for the fourth consecutive month in December to $2.357 billion, up 18.3 per cent from $1.993bn in the corresponding month last year, data released by the Ministry of Commerce showed on Friday.
However, the December export proceeds posted a growth of 8.4pc when compared with $2.174bn in November 2020.
The increase in overall exports is mainly driven by double-digit growth in proceeds from textile and clothing sectors as well as engineering products, surgical instruments and value-added leather products.
Prime Minister Imran Khan took to Twitter to extend congratulations to exporters for achieving record exports in the month of December 2020. “Congratulations to all the exporters on achieving record exports in Dec 2020 with a growth of 18% over the previous year. Well done & keep up this trend. A major pillar of our govt’s economic policy is export enhancement & we will provide full support to promote export culture,” the prime minister tweeted.
			
Commerce Adviser Razak Dawood said that 18.3pc growth in export proceeds in the month of December is the highest export ever.
Between July to December, the export proceeds increased by 4.9pc to $12.104bn as compared to $11.533bn in the corresponding period last year.
“This shows the resilience of the economy of Pakistan and it is a vindication of the government’s policy to keep the wheels of economy running during the Covid-19 pandemic”, the adviser said.
The adviser went on to say that he commended exporters for achieving this feat during these testing times and urged them to aggressively focus on capturing a larger share of international trade.
Exports in the new fiscal year started on a positive note but witnessed a steep decline of 19pc in August before rebounding in September, October, and November.
To promote exports of textile and non-textile products, the government is providing cash subsidies besides slashing duty and taxes on import of raw materials.
In FY20, exports fell by 6.83pc or $1.57bn to $21.4bn, compared to $22.97bn the previous year. Data shows visible improvements in export orders from international buyers, mainly in the textile and clothing sectors since May.",Newspaper
"Foreigners invest $77.2m in govt papers
","January 2, 2021","KARACHI: Foreign investment in local bonds reached $77.2 million till Dec 31, 2020, data released by the State Bank of Pakistan showed on Friday. 
With the emergence of Covid-19 in March, foreign investments in treasury bills and Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs) left the country within a few months. However, foreign investors started to return in Nov 2020, with the PIBs receiving about $43m in that month.
Foreign investors found confidence to invest more in the bonds through Special Convertible Rupee Accounts (SCRA), under which there are no restrictions on investing and withdrawing the investment.
According to the SBP data, investors made a total investment of $33.6m in the PIBs in Dec 2020. 
The returns on PIBs are highly attractive for investors. Banks and non-banks also invested heavily in the PIBs. 
According to another SBP report, so far banks and non-banks’ total investments in PIBs stood at Rs6.733 trillion. 
Currently, PIBs offer returns up to 8.24 per cent per annum on three-year PIBs while the benchmark 10-years PIBs offer 8.94pc yield. In the previous auctions, the cut-off yield for 15-year PIBs was 10pc.
“I believe foreign investments in PIBs were due to the still high returns being offered. The returns are fairly higher than the returns on global level,” said Samiullah Tariq, the head of research at Pak-Kuwait Investment Company.
He said another reason was the improved situation of external account as the current account has been posting surplus since July FY21.
Since the beginning of new calendar year 2020, PIBs were offering much higher returns. The cut-off yield for three-years was 11.53pc, for five-years at 10.93pc while the benchmark 10-years PIBs were offering 10.75pc. 
The returns were higher due to very high policy interest rate. Interest rate was 13.25pc till mid-March 2020. The rate was drastically reduced to 7pc in next few months which is still unchanged.",Newspaper

Sources in the meeting said the prime minister has tasked the committee to come up with a strategy on constantly rising prices of steel bars after detailed research analysis relating to local production of steel bars, consumers’ interest and impact on government’s revenue. 
Builders have been urging the government to take notice of soaring steel bar prices that have risen by over Rs22,000 per tonne from mid-November till December to Rs132,500-135,500 per tonne, while the steel bar makers attribute this to rising steel scrap prices in the world market.

The exchange says China Telecom Corp. Limited, China Mobile Limited, and China Unicom Hong Kong Limited will be delisted from the exchange. Trump issued an order Nov 12 barring investment in publicly traded companies that the US government says are owned or controlled by the Chinese military.
The statement issued late Thursday says the exchange will suspend trading of the companies as early as Jan 7 or as late as Jan 11. It says the stock issuers can appeal to a committee of the NYSE’s board.
The Chinese government has accused Washington of misusing national security as an excuse to hamper competition and has warned that Trumps order would hurt US and other investors worldwide.
Political analysts expect little change in policy under President-elect Joe Biden due to widespread frustration with Chinas trade and human rights records and accusations of spying and technology theft.

"Central Punjab’s late resurgence leaves KP jittery
","January 2, 2021","KARACHI: Central Punjab staged a dramatic comeback after Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were seemingly on course to dominate the opening day of their five-day Quaid-e-Azam Trophy final here at the National Stadium on Friday.
Central Punjab needed inspiration of their young captain Hasan Ali to nullify the advantage Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had taken when the in-form Kamran Ghulam and Adil Amin were stitching together a substantial partnership on either side of the 60-minute break for lunch and Jumma prayers.
From a commanding 227-3 roughly an hour before stumps were pulled out for the day, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa suddenly found themselves in strife at a nervy tally of 285-7 with their trusted duo of Kamran and Adil both perishing in the 70s.
Until that point of capitulation, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were hotly backed to build on the Kamran-Adil partnership that was terminated after 132 runs were added by the pair from 249 deliveries in 165 minutes.  Central Punjab were relentless thereafter, losing three more wickets in the space of 47 balls with the arrival of the second new ball.
The extended three-hour first session — a customary occurrence in this country during a domestic first-class game on Fridays — was a battle of attrition, which was eventually won by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, who unsurprisingly maintained their positive intent which had been the hallmark of their display this season.
On a pitch offering decent pace and bounce, it was a brave call from Khalid Usman to bat first. He was vindicated when his batsmen prospered to 166-3 in 41 overs, while setting up an ideal platform for an imposing first-innings score with a slice of luck also coming to their aid.
Undeterred by the rather premature exit of Fakhar Zaman and Rehan Afridi before they joined in the pavilion by a well-set Israrullah, inside the opening 22 overs of exhilarating cricket. The proclamation of Pakistan Navy’s honorary lieutenant failed to inspire Fakhar and having scored 17, the Pakistan left-hander was acrobatically held one-handed down the leg-side off an inside edge by the impressive wicket-keeper Ali Shan off a fit-again Waqas Maqsood.
Encouraged by the dismissal of Fakhar, Waqas then produced peach of a delivery to clip the bails of incoming Rehan for three when the left-arm paceman went round the wicket.
With two wickets in the bag for 43 runs, Central Punjab would have been better placed much before that happened. They were left to regret letting off Israrullah before the opener had opened his account as Qasim Akram fumbled a dolly catch in the slip cordon off Hasan.
Israrullah cashed in on merrily to play a repertoire of pleasing strokes on both sides of the ground. The left-hander not undone until he was foxed by a lovely piece of spin bowling by teenaged all-rounder Qasim Akram, who induced a false stroke from Israrullah (61 off 69 balls, 10 boundaries) with Ali Shan excelling with another good catch, albeit on the second attempt.
With Israrullah gone, Central Punjab were hoping for more wickets coming their way but they were thwarted by Kamran and Adil, who together provided a grand exhibition for budding youngsters how to wriggle out of a tight corner. The scoring-rate didn’t slacken and moving along at just above the rate of four runs an over was the most impressive part of the first period.  
Kamran celebrated his PCB Domestic Cricketer of the Year award, which was announced on Friday, had already amassed 1,065 runs during the preliminary-round phase of the championship and had already gone past 1,100 by the interval. But his departure was totally unexpected as a lapse in concentration cost dearly. Trying to cut a wide ball from slow left-armer Qasim, the right-hander nicked it to Ali Shan, who made no mistake. Kamran’s 76 from 129 balls during a stay of 207 minutes included 15 fours. 
Adil and Zohaib Khan then forged a stand of 41 before Hasan delivered a big blow by sending back Adil for a 202-ball ball 75 (10 boundaries) and completed a fine day by forcing Sajid Khan (6) to pop a catch just behind the slip cordon, leaving Qasim to do the rest just two balls.
And in between those two Hasan wickets, Bilawal Iqbal had trapped Khalid in front of the stumps for three.
On an engrossing day’s play, there was a melodrama of different as well as when a fire outside the ground and behind the Nasim-ul-Ghani Enclosure had stopped action held up the action for several minutes as the atmosphere was filled with heavy smoke.

"NZ call up Henry for second Pakistan Test
","January 2, 2021","CHRISTCHURCH: Can­ter­bury fast bowler Matt Henry was called up to the New Zealand squad for the second Test against Pakistan, starting on Sunday at the Hagley Oval in Christchurch, to replace the injured Neil Wagner, New Zealand Cricket (NZC) has said.
Wagner is expected to be sidelined for around six weeks after sustaining fractures in the toes of his right foot during the first Test at Bay Oval in Mount Maunganui, which the hosts won by 101 runs.
Henry, who has 30 Test wickets, is being rewarded for his recent form which saw him register figures of 6-53 for New Zealand ‘A’ against Pakistan Shaheens last month. The 29-year-old has also taken seven wickets from four Ford Trophy matches this season for Canterbury.
“Matt has been in good form with the ball,” New Zealand head coach Gary Stead said on Friday. “We’re still a couple of days out from the Test, so need to take a look at the surface while also assessing our options for best possible team make-up.”
Henry, 29, is thrilled at the possibility of playing on his home turf which always offers a bit to the pace bowlers, and this week shapes as no different.
“Obviously it’s a shame with what’s happened with Waggy’s [Wagner] foot but I’m very excited to be here at home back in the squad,” said Henry, who is probably vying with all-rounders Daryl Mitchell and Mitchell Santner for a spot in the XI, with one of those three players likely to miss selection.
“The guys have been going so well too so to come and join the team while they’re doing so well is great. [Hagley Oval] is a great venue … it’s a great wicket and I’m looking forward to it, if the opportunity arises to be out there,” Henry added.
While Henry pointed out Wagner — the third-ranked Test bowler in the world — would be missed by New Zealand, Pakistan all-rounder Faheem Ashraf clearly wasn’t upset about his absence, especially on a Hagley Oval pitch that looked ‘greener, bouncier and quicker’ than what the tourists encountered in their heartbreaking defeat at Bay Oval.
“Wagner is a good Test bowler. He’s a seasoned, experienced bowler who creates difficulty for every team he plays against,” Faheem said. “If Wagner is not in the squad, you must be happy and it is a big relief for Pakistan.”
Faheem further said Pakistan going into the final Test with a ‘new mindset’ and eliminating the small errors that cost them in Mount Maunganui as they try to square the series and make a move up the World Test Championship (WTC) table.
But the visitors are almost certain to take the field for the second Test running without their regular skipper Babar Azam, who is still recuperating from a fractured finger sustained during a training session in Queenstown early on the tour and also missed out the three-match Twenty20 International series. 
The Black Caps must win to keep their charge going for the final at Lord’s later in the year. That’s not the only milestone on the periphery of this Test of the home summer, either.
A win would be their six in succession — a New Zealand record — and it would also be the first time they have completed a perfect home season in a multiple-tour summer, having beaten the West Indies 2-0 before the Pakistan series.
They would also officially move to No 1 in the International Cricket Council’s Test rankings for the first time, with either a win or a draw against Pakistan.
Not that any of that talk has been a focus for Stead. “Every Test match we go into, it’s just about winning that and doing everything we can to win that Test match and I don’t really want us to change that mentality at the moment.
“If we start getting too far ahead of ourselves and start thinking of things that might happen in the future, you can get lost in what you’re doing right now.
“For us it will just be about playing each ball as it comes.”

"India add Natarajan in Test squad for injured Yadav
","January 2, 2021","SYDNEY: India named left-arm seamer T. Natarajan on Friday as the replacement for injured paceman Umesh Yadav ahead of the last two Tests against Australia.
Yadav bowled only 3.3 overs in Australia’s second innings in the second Test before limping off as India went on to level the series 1-1 with an eight-wicket victory in Melbourne.
The 33-year-old will miss the remaining matches in Sydney and Brisbane in the latest injury setback to the tourists, who are also without regular captain and batting mainstay Virat Kohli, who has returned to India for the birth of his child.
“The fast bowler will not recover completely ahead of the remaining two Test matches and has been ruled out of the series,” Jay Shah, the secretary of India’s cricket board, said in a statement.
Veteran seamer Ishant Sharma missed the entire tour with a side strain while experienced paceman Mohammed Shami was ruled out after fracturing his forearm while batting in the opening Test in Adelaide.
The 29-year-old Natarajan was initially picked as a net bowler for India’s tour Down Under after his strong showing in the Indian Premier League.
However, a spot opened up for Natarajan in the limited-overs squad due to an injury to a spinner and he made an instant impact on his first international tour.
Shardul Thakur, who made his Test debut against the West Indies in 2018, replaced Shami in India’s squad ahead of the Boxing Day Test and is likely to get the nod for the third Test in Sydney starting Jan 7.

"Babar, Rizwan, Fawad, Aliya bag top PCB awards for 2020
","January 2, 2021","LAHORE: Pakistan’s captain in all three formats, Babar Azam, was declared as Most Valuable Cricketer of the Year and also clinched the title of White-ball Cricketer of the Year as the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Friday announced the awards for the year 2020 without including the categories of referees and scorers.
“Pakistan captain Babar Azam was named as the Most Valuable Cricketer of the Year following his stellar performances across all formats during the 2020 calendar year. In addition to the most prestigious award, the 26-year-old was also adjudged the White-ball Cricketer of the Year after averaging 110.5 and 55.2 in the ODIs and T20Is, respectively. In the four Tests, Babar scored 338 runs at 67.6,” a PCB press release stated on Friday.
Moreover, acting captain of Pakistan Test team in New Zealand, Mohammad Rizwan was declared as Test Cricketer of the Year.
“In five Tests, he aggregated 302 runs, mostly in difficult situations, with four half-centuries at an average of 43.14. He also accounted for 12 batsmen behind the wickets,” the PCB release said.
However, it may be pointed out here that the prolific Babar would have also seized this category, too if anyone had considered his Test statistics. Babar played just four Test matches to score 338 runs with one century and an excellent average of 67.46. He could not play the last Test of the year against New Zealand due to injury otherwise, his aggregate would have been over 400. 
In fact, there was no close competition to Babar among the players as seasoned batsmen like Azhar Ali, Shan Masood, Haris Sohail, Asad Shafiq could hardly average around or below 40 which is indeed a pathetic scenario.
“Fawad Alam’s fighting and courageous 102 at Mount Maunganui, his first Test century in 11 years that made global headlines, was chosen as the Individual Performance of the Year by the independent jury that comprised highly respected and distinguished cricket personalities,” the press release further stated.
In the women’s section, all-rounder Aliya Riaz was named as the Women’s Cricketer of the Year while 19-year-old Fatima Sana was chosen as the Women’s Emerging Cricketer of the Year.
The 17-year-old Test fast bowler Naseem Shah won the Emerging International Cricketer of the Year following his 20 wickets in eight Tests, including a hat-trick against Bangladesh that made him the youngest bowler to achieve the rare feat.
The Domestic Cricketer of the Year honours went to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kamran Ghulam after he became the only batsman in the ongoing first-class Quaid-e-Azam Trophy to complete 1,000 runs. He finished 19 innings of 10 round matches with 1,065 runs with four centuries and four half-centuries at an average of just under 60.
Rohail Nazir’s progression from the U19 level to Pakistan Shaheens’ captain has won him the Men’s Emerging Cricketer of the Year.
The match referees and six Cricket Associations captains voted Asif Yaqoob as the Umpire of the Year. However, no category for match-referees and scorers did not feature in the contest which was against the previous practices of the PCB.
When contacted, the PCB spokesman said that in 2017 and 2018 the PCB did not organize the awards event directly, but this time the PCB announced it under its own supervision and, following the international practices, it did not include the categories of referees and scorers. It may be mentioned here that during Zaka Ashraf’s tenure as PCB chairman, both the categories were also included and were also there in 2017 and 2018 while no such ceremony was organized in 2019 by the incumbent body of the PCB.
Moreover, Pakistan men’s national cricket team’s gesture to visit the Bangladesh cricket team dressing room to thank them for their first visit to Pakistan in over a decade earned them the Spirit of Cricket award while the independent jury decided that the staging of a highly successful and smooth HBL PSL 2020 in Pakistan, the first-ever PSL edition to be entirely held in front of home crowds should be declared as the Corporate Achievement of the Year.
The winners will be presented with specially designed trophies during the upcoming home series against South Africa.
Meanwhile, the winners of the trophies expressed pleasure over winning the awards and vowed to draw inspiration from these nominations to work harder in the future.
Babar said: “I am truly humbled to have been awarded with the White-ball and Most Valuable Cricketer of the Year awards in what has been a difficult year for all professional athletes. Without the support of my teammates and family, this would not have been possible and, as such, I owe big time to all of them for my successes in 2020 and hope they will continue to support me in years to come.
“Captaining Pakistan at home was a huge moment for me though without crowds it took a bit of the gloss off that honour. I think the cricket I played in England was some of the best. England is never an easy place to play due to the conditions and the players they boast, but to go out there and perform gave me the satisfaction and encouragement that I can compete against the best and help my side to do better.
“I am disappointed to miss the three T20Is and the first Test in New Zealand as I was determined and motivated to perform against what is a really good New Zealand team and managed outstandingly by Kane Williamson.
“I will reflect in 2020 with a lot of satisfaction and hopefully the honour and rewards I have won will only contribute to me working harder to further enhance and improve my performances as well as my young and talented team.”

"Iran tells IAEA it plans to enrich uranium up to 20pc
","January 2, 2021","VIENNA: Iran has told the United Nations nuclear watchdog it plans to enrich uranium to 20 percent purity, a level it achieved before its 2015 accord, at its Fordow site buried inside a mountain.  
The move is the latest of several recent announcements made by Iran to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that it plans to further breach the deal, which it started violating in 2019 in retaliation for Washington’s withdrawal from the agreement and the re-imposition of US sanctions against Tehran. 
This step was one of many mentioned in a law passed by Iran’s parliament last month in response to the killing of the country’s top nuclear scientist, which Tehran has blamed on Israel. 
Such moves by Iran could complicate efforts by US president-elect Joe Biden to rejoin the deal. 
“Iran has informed the Agency that in order to comply with a legal act recently passed by the country’s parliament, the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran intends to produce low-enriched uranium (LEU) up to 20 percent at the Fordow fuel enrichment plant,” the IAEA said in a statement.",Newspaper
"Divided United Kingdom casts off into the Brexit unknown
","January 2, 2021","LONDON: The United Kingdom began the New Year outside the European Union’s orbit on Friday after ending a tempestuous 48-year liaison with the European project, its most significant geopolitical shift since the loss of empire.
Brexit took effect in substance on Thursday at the strike of midnight in Brussels, or 2300 London time (GMT), at the end of a transition period that largely maintained the status quo for 11 months after Britain formally left the EU on Jan 31, 2020.
“This is an amazing moment for this country,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson, 56, said in his New Year’s Eve message.  “We have our freedom in our hands and it is up to us to make the most of it.”  For five years, the frenzied gyrations of the Brexit crisis dominated European affairs, buffeted the sterling markets and tarnished the United Kingdom’s reputation as a reliable pillar of Western stability.
Supporters cast Brexit as the dawn of a newly independent  “global Britain”, but the drama has weakened the bonds that bind England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
After all the vitriol, one of the most significant events in European history since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 passed with little fanfare: the United Kingdom slipped away, shrouded in the silence of the Covid-19 crisis.
With gatherings banned in London and most of the country due to soaring rates of infection, there were few outward displays of emotion when the Great Bell known as Big Ben tolled 11 through a scaffold on Thursday night.
As EU leaders and citizens bade farewell, Johnson said there would be no bonfire of regulations to build a  “bargain basement Dickensian Britain” and that the country would remain the  “quintessential European civilisation”.
But Johnson, the face of the Brexit campaign, has been short on detail about what he wants to build with Britain’s  “independence” — or how to do it while borrowing record amounts to pay for the Covid-19 crisis.
His 80-year-old father, Stanley Johnson, who had voted for Britain to remain in the bloc, said he was applying for a French passport, which would give him rights and freedoms in Europe now inaccessible to most Britons. 
In the June 23, 2016, referendum, 17.4 million voters, or 52pc, backed Brexit while 16.1 million, or 48pc, backed staying in the bloc. Few have changed their minds since. England and Wales voted out but Scotland and Northern Ireland voted in.
“Scotland will be back soon, Europe. Keep the light on,” Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Thursday.
The referendum revealed a United Kingdom polarised about much more than the European Union, and fuelled soul searching about everything from secession and immigration to capitalism, the legacy of empire and what it now means to be British.
Leaving was once the far-fetched dream of a motley crew of eurosceptics on the fringes of British politics: the UK joined in 1973 as the sick man of Europe. Two decades ago British leaders were arguing whether to join the euro. They never did.
But the turmoil of the euro zone crisis, attempts to integrate the EU further, fears about mass immigration and discontent with leaders in London helped Brexiteers win the referendum with a message of patriotic, if vague, hope.
“We see a global future for ourselves,” said Johnson who won power in 2019 and, against the odds, clinched a Brexit divorce treaty and a trade deal, as well as the biggest Conservative parliamentary majority since Margaret Thatcher.",Newspaper
"Sindh to get Covid-19 vaccine by mid-January, says Pechuho
","January 2, 2021","KARACHI: The health department on Friday notified the Provincial Vaccine Administration Coordination Cell (PVACC) after getting a commitment from the National Vaccine Task Force and the National Command Operation Centre (NCOC) for supply of the Covid-19 vaccine by Jan 15. 
Chairing a meeting on the subject, Health Minister Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho stated that the NCOC and the National Vaccine Task Force had committed to supply the province with 250,000 Covid-19 vaccine doses by mid-January; each recipient would get two doses with a gap of 21 days.
In the first phase, she informed officials, healthcare providers performing duties in the Covid wards and other front-line workers engaged in handling coronavirus patients would be administered the vaccine. 
The health minister instructed the staff to prepare data on the staff working in the public and private healthcare system that would also be included in the first phase of vaccine administration. 
The second phase would include people above 60 years of age and those with comorbid conditions.
The people, who would be marked to receive the vaccine, would get prior information about vaccine administration through a phone call and later receive a vaccination card. 
It was also decided in the meeting that 50 cubicles would be set up at the Expo Centre and 5,000 individuals would be vaccinated in a single day.
Facilities for vaccine administration would be provided at tertiary care hospitals in the interior areas of Sindh. 
According to a health department notification, the Provincial Vaccine Administration Cell would be headed by secretary health Dr Kazim Hussain Jatoi while its members include MPA/parliamentary secretary Muhammad Qasim Soomro, director general health Dr Irshad Ahmed, programme director EPI Dr Akram Sultan, Dr Mazahir Ali, Raza Muhammad Shar, both section officers at the health department, Sindh IT head Faizan Gul Sheikh and provincial technical focal person at the Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) on Polio Dr Ahmed Ali Sheikh.
Fayyaz Hussain Abbasi, the coordinator at the EOC and additional secretary PH Dr Manzoor Ali Wassan would act as its focal person and deputy focal person, respectively. 
It may be recalled that a special (federal) cabinet committee has recently decided to pre-book 1.1 million doses of vaccine from a Chinese state-owned company, Sinopharm.
The decision, which was made on the day when Sinopharm announced that its Covid-19 vaccine was 79.34 per cent effective, is contingent upon emergency use approval by the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap). 
Once approved and procured, the government will provide free-of-cost Covid-19 vaccine to all front-line health workers in the first quarter of 2021.",Pakistan
"Civil servants facing proceedings barred from duty
","January 2, 2021","KARACHI: The Sindh High Court has restrained the Sindh chief secretary from giving any posting and administrative assignment to those civil and government servants who are facing criminal and disciplinary proceedings. 
The two-judge bench headed by Justice Nadeem Akhtar also expressed resentment over unreasonable delay in concluding disciplinary proceedings on the part of departments concerned of the provincial government and directed them to decide such proceedings expeditiously in accordance with law. 
It further asked the chief secretary to explain why such officials were allowed to continue their duties and also promoted during pendency of such proceedings. 
The bench observed that after perusal of reports filed by the chief secretary regarding the officials facing criminal proceedings, it appeared that such officials were still serving in different departments of the Sindh government while proceedings against them were pending at different judicial forums. 
It noted that such civil/government servants were not entitled under the law to perform their duties until they were exonerated of the charge/offence levelled against them. 
The bench further observed that in a number of cases disciplinary proceedings initiated against government/civil servants were not decided or concluded within a reasonable time and due to this reason, the cases of their promotion were deferred. 
Such unreasonable delay on part of the departments concerned caused hardship for such officials, uncertainty within the departments and unnecessary litigation before courts, it added and directed the government that the same must be decided expeditiously in accordance with law.
The bench directed the chief secretary to submit a comprehensive compliance report till Jan 14. 
A resident of Mirpurkhas had petitioned the SHC and impleaded the chief secretary, secretary of general administration and coordination department and secretary of irrigation department and several other officials as respondents.

"LHC asked to strike down Senate secret balloting
","January 2, 2021","LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has been asked to strike down the method of secret balloting for the election of the Senate to discourage floor-crossing and vote buying. 
Munir Ahmad, a lawyer by profession, in a writ petition filed through Advocate Azhar Siddique also assails the vires of section 122 (6) of the Election Act 2017 for being in violation of articles 222 and 226 of the Constitution. 
The petitioner submits that the article 226 restricts secret balloting only for those elections that are held under the Constitution, which include elections for the office of president, speakers and deputy speakers of national and provincial assemblies, and election of chairman and deputy chairman of the Senate. 
He states that the election for the members of the Senate does not fall within the definition of the elections as envisaged in article 226. Therefore, he argues, the voting can be held through an open ballot. 
The petitioner contends that the framer of the Constitution, unfortunately, left a number of things open to be settled by parliament through statutory legislation and parliament has to confine itself to making the things transparent, merit based and to develop a system free of rigging and manipulation.
He pleads that by incorporating the words “secret balloting” in section 122 of the Election Act, prima facie, a door has been opened for corruption and corrupt practices and taking undue advantages to the members, therefore, this provision is null and void in the eye of law and has at the same time violated constitutional provisions.
The petitioner asks the court to allow the petition and strike down the method of the secret balloting in order to discourage the floor-crossing, use of looted and laundered money for vote-buying in Senate elections. 
The lawyer also urges the court to set aside section 122 (6) of the Elections Act 2017 for being ultra vires to articles 222 & 226 of the Constitution in the interest of public, justice, equity and fair play.",Pakistan

"China to provide $100m grant for road project

An agreement to this effect was signed here on Thursday during a meeting between Chinese Ambassador Nong Rong and federal Minister for Economic Affairs Makhdum Khusro Bakhtyar.  Bilateral economic relations and China-Pakistan Economic Corridor projects were discussed during the meeting. 
The ‘Letter of Exchange’ provides for the rehabilitation of 66km four sections of the highway between Hala in Matiari district and Moro in Naushahro Feroze district Speaking on the occasion, Ambassador Rong said that N5 was an important road that extended from the southern part of the country to the north-western border in Pakistan and carried a large amount of traffic. Unfortunately, this road was seriously damaged by the flood in 2010. 
At the request of the Pakistani government, the Chinese government helped repair parts of N5 and N55 during 2011 and 2016. With joint efforts by the Pakistani and Chinese workers, the rehabilitation work was completed at the end of 2016, and it greatly improved the road conditions of the relevant sections. 
Considering the importance of the N5 highway, the Chinese government agreed to rehabilitate the remaining 66km of the road with Chinese grant in accordance with the previous bilateral agreement. 
Ambassador Rong said that rehabilitation of the N5 highway was the largest road project funded by the Chinese grant in recent years in Pakistan. The implementation of the project will further increase traffic capacity and facilitate people’s travel along the route.

"FBR misses first half target by Rs16bn
","January 1, 2021","ISLAMABAD: The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) collection in the first half (July-December) of the current fiscal year stood at Rs2.194 trillion, missing the projected Rs2.21tr target by Rs16 billion, provisional data showed on Thursday.
However, revenue collections were increased by five per cent year-on-year when compared to Rs2.092tr during the same period last year. 
For achieving the annual target, the FBR will have to collect Rs2.769tr during the second half (January-June) of 2020-21.
On a monthly basis, the FBR collected Rs504bn in December as against the projected target of Rs541bn, showing a shortfall of Rs37bn. However, it grew by 7pc when compared to Rs469bn collections during the same month last year.
The growth in December is usually higher owing to the corporate income tax payments.
Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Revenue Dr Waqar Masood Khan told Dawn that he was expecting Rs10bn more in next few days which will add to the December collections. He said that the FBR is close to the target keeping in view the prevailing situation. The revenue collection is the reflection of the economic growth in the country.
“We are still confronting the Covid-19 impacts”, he added.
Dr Masood further said that he was expecting higher growth in revenue collection in the second half especially March onwards. He said the target was set on the assumption that there will be no Covid-19. Despite the pandemic, he argued the collections have registered growth.
He said that there will be no revision in the annual target. “We are working on that thing; not to revise the target”, he said while adding the FBR will be very close to the target by the end of fiscal year. As the economy accelerates, there will be better results, he said.
But contrary to this, it is also believed that slower performance in the FBR is also due to lack of government interest in running affairs of the tax machinery on an ad-hoc basis. The much-talked about tax reforms and controlling corruption in the FBR were mere claims as the government has not taken any action to overhaul the workings of the board.
Before coming into power, the ruling party had vowed to introduce tax reforms and raise tax from elites but has failed to make any changes and remains focused on indirect taxes similar to the tactics used by previous governments.
Despite the introduction of several measures, the realisation of income tax is much below expectations. The income tax collection during the July-December period stood at Rs823bn as against the target of Rs905bn, showing a shortfall of Rs82bn.
The income tax collection showed a growth of 4pc when compared with collection of Rs794bn during the same months last year.
Meanwhile, the sales tax collection jumped 13pc to Rs1.013trn in the first half of  the current fiscal year from Rs892bn in the same period last year. However, the target was projected at Rs869bn, much lower than last year’s collections. The growth came as a result of rise in fuel prices, increase in imports and revival of economic activities during the period under review.
The federal excise duty (FED) collections were up 1pc to Rs127bn as against Rs126bn last year. The FED target for July-December was set at Rs149bn, which was missed by Rs22bn.
Moreover, customs collection recorded no growth as it stood at Rs334bn during the July-December period. The target projected under customs was Rs288bn, which was surpassed. The customs duty in December saw a growth of 8pc over last year and also surpassed the projected target.
The payment of Rs102bn refunds in the first half of this fiscal year — an increase of 90pc over last year’s payment of Rs54bn — suggested a sharp acceleration in economic activity leading to revival of industrial production.
The government, while preparing the budget for the ongoing fiscal year, had assured the International Monetary Fund to raise Rs4.963tr in FY21 against Rs3.989tr collected in FY20 — a projected increase of 24.4pc.",Newspaper
"Airbus-Boeing spat hits new heights at year end
","January 1, 2021","WASHINGTON: A long-running US-EU aircraft trade dispute flew to new heights as the year drew to a close, as Washington hit France and Germany with new punitive import tariffs.
It was the latest retaliation in the 16-year-old conflict over government subsidies for competing aircraft manufacturers Airbus and Boeing, and defies recent statements that the sides were close to reaching a final truce.
The US Trade Representative (USTR)late Wednesday announced new tariffs on aircraft parts, wine, cognac and brandies from France and Germany, adding those to a long list of products from EU countries that have been subject to 25 percent duties since 2019.
The USTR said the move was in retaliation for tariffs the European Union imposed in November which it considers unjustified and calculated unfairly.
The latest twist in the battle over aircraft subsidies that turned increasingly sour under the protectionist instincts of US President Donald Trump comes despite hopes for a trade truce once President-elect Joe Biden takes office January 20.
The World Trade Organization (WTO) has given the go ahead for Brussels and Washington to impose the retaliatory duties in separate but related cases over subsidies granted to Boeing and Airbus.
After a WTO ruling in October, the EU last month levied additional customs duties on $4 billion worth of American products including Boeing planes but also farm produce, such as wheat and tobacco, plus strong alcohol and chocolate.
But Washington said the EU calculated the amount using pandemic-ravaged trade data, which meant a much wider array of American goods were targeted.
“In implementing its tariffs... the EU used trade data from a period in which trade volumes had been drastically reduced due to the horrific effects on the global economy from the Covid-19 virus,” the USTR said.
“The result of this choice was that Europe imposed tariffs on substantially more products than would have been covered if it had utilised a normal period.” As a result the US  “is forced to change its reference period to the same period used by the European Union,” the statement said.
At the time the tariffs were announced, USTR complained the move was unjustified since the subsidies provided to Boeing by the state of Washington had long since been revoked, but did not raise the calculation issue in the public statement.
But the statement Wednesday said  “the United States explained to the EU the distortive effect of its selected time period, the EU refused to change its approach.” However, USTR said that  “in order to not escalate the situation, the United States is adjusting the product coverage by less than the full amount that would be justified utilizing the EU’s chosen time period.” The US also deplored an EU decision to exclude the UK from its calculations, which it argued unfairly increased the tariffs.
As usual in the trans-Atlantic dispute, each side blames the other for the escalation.
Hope for a truce Brussels complained on Thursday that Washington had  “unilaterally” disrupted ongoing talks and said it would seek a solution to the row with the incoming administration, which takes office on January 20.
The European Commission said it “regrets that the United States has chosen to add further EU products to its retaliation list in the WTO Airbus case on aircraft subsidies.”  
“The EU will engage with the new US Administration at the earliest possible moment to continue these negotiations and find a lasting solution to the dispute,” it said.
The feud over European aircraft manufacturer Airbus and its American competitor Boeing is the longest and most complicated ever handled by the WTO.
The aviation feud predates Trump, but Washington quickly embraced the opportunity to impose tariffs on in European goods after the WTO last year authorized duties on a record $7.5 billion in goods.
Washington imposed punitive tariffs of 25 percent on iconic EU products such as wine, cheese and olive oil and put a 15 percent tariff on Airbus planes in March.",Newspaper
"‘Most prolific’ serial killer in US history dies
","January 1, 2021","LOS ANGELES: The man authorities say was the most prolific serial killer in US history, with nearly 60 confirmed victims, died on Wednesday in California. He was 80.
Samuel Little, who had diabetes, heart trouble and other ailments, died at a California hospital, according to the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. He was serving a life sentence for multiple counts of murder.
California corrections department spokeswoman Vicky Waters said there was no sign of foul play, and his cause of death will be determined by a coroner.
A career criminal who had been in and out jail for decades, Little denied for years hed ever killed anyone.
Then, in 2018, he opened up to Texas Ranger James Holland, who had been asked to question him about a killing it turned out Little did not commit. During approximately 700 hours of interviews, however, Little provided details of scores of slayings only the killer would know.
A skilled artist, he even provided Holland with dozens of paintings and drawings of his victims, sometimes scribbling their names when he could remember them, as well as details such as the year and location of the murder and where hed dumped the body.
By the time of his death, Little had confessed to killing 93 people between 1970 and 2005. Most of the slayings took place in Florida and Southern California.
Authorities, who continue to investigate his claims, said they have confirmed nearly 60 killings and have no reason to doubt the others.
“Nothing hes ever said has been proven to be wrong or false,” Holland told the CBS news magazine 60 Minutes in 2019.
The numbers dwarf those of Green River killer Gary Ridgway (49), John Wayne Gacy (33) and Ted Bundy (36).
Almost all of Little’s victims were women, many of them prostitutes, drug addicts or poor people living on the edges of society. They were individuals, he said he believed, who would leave few people behind to look for them and not much evidence for police to follow.
Indeed, local authorities in states across the country initially classified many of the deaths as accidents, drug overdoses or the result of unknown causes.",Newspaper

"December inflation eases to 8pc
","January 1, 2021","Inflation eased to eight per cent in December, from 8.3pc last month, on the back of a slight decrease in the prices of perishable food items and the transport index, the latest data released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) showed.
Higher food prices continued to increase upward pressure on inflation as prices of non-perishable items jumped 16.3pc year-on-year during the month under review. 
In addition to the food sector, consumers witnessed a 9.9pc increase in restaurant and hotel prices, 9.6pc in clothing and 8.1pc in health.
On the other hand, the prices of perishable food items declined by 0.6pc, whereas those of the transport sector fell 3.5pc, helping bring down overall inflation.
During the month under review, data showed that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rate in urban areas rose 7pc year-on-year while the rate jumped 9.5pc in rural areas.
On a month-on-month basis, inflation during the month declined by 0.7pc — the first decline in eight months. This was likely on account of seasonal declines in the price of perishable items.
On a cumulative basis, average inflation during the July-December period was 8.63pc compared to 11.11pc during the same period last year. During the six-month period, inflation in urban areas averaged at 7.31pc compared to 10.63pc in rural areas.
The country’s central bank has ignored high inflation figures and kept interest rates in the negative territory in order to support growth and boost economic momentum. 
With relatively unchanged core inflation at 5.6pc (month-on-month) in December, the State Bank of Pakistan will likely continue with the accommodative monetary policy stance.  
Analysts say an economic recovery will likely take precedence over inflationary pressures, particularly in light of the second Covid-19 wave; the central bank may have room to push the eventual monetary tightening as far back as May 2021 or even July 2021.",Business
"PDM has died its own death, says Imran
","January 5, 2021"," 
ISLAMABAD: A day after the Bahawalpur rally of the opposition’s Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), Prime Minister Imran Khan’s team of spokespersons adopted an aggressive stance on Monday, following the premier’s line that the movement was all but over.
Before heading to various TV channels to participate in talk shows, the spokespersons attended a brainstorming session at PM House which was presided over by Prime Minister Khan.
During the session, Mr Khan said that the PDM was no more a threat to the government.
Talking to 
, a participant of the meeting, who did not want to be named, quoted the prime minister as saying: “The PDM has almost lost and died its own death, so it is no more a threat to the government.”
He directed his spokespersons to give a “tough time” to the opposition in the media, which could be seen when the spokespersons took on the opposition leaders on front foot.
The prime minister reiterated that the opposition had come on the streets to seek National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO)-like concessions for its leaders, who had plundered national wealth and were now facing corruption references.
“PDM’s entire movement is aimed at getting an NRO, but I will not give them any relief,” he said.
The team of spokespersons consists of those Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leaders who are often seen on TV screens, promoting the government’s point of view and the prime minister’s narrative on different issues.
They include Information Minister Shibli Faraz, Minister for Science and Technology Fawad Chaudhry, Minister for Planning and Development Asad Umar, Education Minister Shafqat Mehmood, Minister for Industries Hammad Azhar, Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Youth Affairs Usman Dar, Senator Faisal Javed, Minister for Communication Murad Saeed, Nadeem Afzal Gondal, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Information Rauf Hassan, Special Assistant Shahbaz Gill, Walid Iqbal, Kanwal Shauzab, Maleeka Bukhari, Minister of State for Climate Change Zartaj Gul, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Ali Mohammad Khan and Sadaqat Abbasi.
The prime minister’s narrative-building mechanism begins with the meeting of spokespersons on a regular basis during which Mr Khan gives them a guideline on how to counter the opposition on media.
According to a senior party leader, the prime minister personally gives various spokespersons feedback on their performance through WhatsApp.
During one such meeting on Monday – a day after the PDM public rally in Bahawalpur – the prime minister said that cracks had appeared in the opposition’s movement as some major parties had decided not to tender resignations and were adamant on contesting the forthcoming Senate elections.
Another participant of the meeting said the prime minister directed his team to vigorously present the government’s achievements in media so that people would know what the government had done during its over two-and-a-half years term, especially on the economic side.
The prime minister said in the new year, the government would focus on improving delivery of basic rights and facilities to the people.
One of the spokespersons, Kanwal Shouzab, said in a TV programme that the PM’s team consisted of “diehard” spokespersons.
“We are diehard spokespersons and not like the spokespersons of the opposition who have been slaves for generations,” she said.
Responding to a remark of another guest in the show, she said the PM’s spokespersons were usually seen on TV screens to present “the factual” position which was twisted by the opposition’s representatives.
“We do not want to humiliate the opposition but present the factual picture to the people,” she added.
Ms Shouzab said the PDM was serving the purpose of Indian media by criticising state institutions, especially the army.
Another participant said these meetings provided an opportunity to the spokespersons to get their policy line right from the top as well as avail the chance to ask questions, give suggestions and acquire a better understanding of the ‘hows’ and ‘whys’.
The prime minister also discussed the forthcoming Senate polls and hoped that the ruling PTI would get a majority in the Upper House.
He said the government was waiting for the verdict of the Supreme Court on holding of Senate elections through show of hands and not secret balloting.
“Once the Supreme Court gives us its guidelines, we will act accordingly and if required, make the necessary legislation,” PM Khan added.",Pakistan
"Overcautious CP set up fascinating finale after KP collapse
","January 5, 2021","KARACHI: Central Punjab’s defence of the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy is far from over after the reigning champions’ overcautious approach against Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Monday set the stage for a thrilling finale to the decider here at the National Stadium.
The equation for both sides is quite simple — either Central Punjab score the remaining 216 runs to retain their crown or Khyber Pakhtunkhwa dethrone them by grabbing the final eight wickets of the domestic first-class season — on Tuesday’s last day of what has been an absorbing contest thus far with pendulum repeatedly swinging from one team to the other.
After bowling out Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for 312 in the morning session of the penultimate day, Central Punjab began their chase for the 356-run target — and plodded their way to 140-2 in 70 overs by close of play — with an ultra-defensive mindset.
Having struggled throughout the championship for a decent partnership upfront — their best being 92 against Southern Punjab at the UBL Sports Complex in late November — as Mohammad Akhlaq and Ali Zaryab ate up as many as 21.2 overs to score 35 for the first wicket in 97 minutes.
Spinner Sajid put the left-handed Ali (10 off 66 balls) out of his misery when the opener offered no shot to a delivery that straightened to trap plumb in front of the stumps. Ali’s opening partners Akhlaq — spent no less than 202 minutes over his 145-ball knock of 48 (six boundaries) after having deputized for regular wicket-keeper Ali Shan during Khyber Pakht­un­khwa’s second innings which lasted 431 minutes.
A lapse in concentration contributed to Akhlaq’s dismissal shortly after tea as the right-hander attempted to break free but only got succeeding in nicking paceman Arshad Iqbal to Israrullah who brought off a sharp catch at first slip.
Test discard Usman Salahuddin, who added 54 with Akhlaq, has been the driving force on the batting front for Central Punjab, and not for the first time in recent weeks, the right-handed passed the test with flying colours. By stumps Usman had reached his second half-century of the match — and eighth in the tournament — as crossed 900 first-class runs for the season before ending the day on 51 from 147 deliveries with just three fours during a stay of 194 minutes.
Usman’s partner Moha­mmad Saad scored a slightly better rate while making a 63-ball 27 in 89 minutes during their stand of 51 so far.
Earlier in the day, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa failed to put the match beyond Central Punjab’s reach as they lost their last five wickets for 58 runs after resuming at 243-5. Kamran Ghulam’s record-breaking season with the bat came to an abrupt halt when he slashed a sharp catch to substitute Tayyab Tahir at point after adding only four to his overnight 108. Kamran broke a 36-year-old record on Sunday when he surpassed Saadat Ali’s tally of 1,217 runs in a single Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, and when he was dismissed on Monday, he had amassed 1249 runs at 65.45 with five centuries and as many half-centuries. 
Captain Khalid Usman had the major share in the runs made by his side on day four as the 34-year-old all-rounder hit up 53 with his 73-ball innings featuring seven boun­daries until Qasim Akram held a good catch at deep square-leg off Central Punjab skipper Hasan Ali, who had bowled a total of 17 no-balls across both innings. Waqas Maqsood added two more wickets to finish with 4-77 and a match bag of 7-136 — the most for either side in this final.

"Commission suggests opening of four temples for tourism
","January 5, 2021","ISLAMABAD: The Shoaib Suddle commission in its report placed before the Supreme Court on the vandalising and burning of a century-old Samadhi (shrine) of a Hindu saint in Teri, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, has recommended the opening of four Hindu temples for international tourism.
The one-man commission report, which was placed before the apex court on Monday, a day ahead of the scheduled hearing on the burning of the Hindu temple in Teri, recommended that the four sites — Param Hans Ji Maharaj Samadhi/Mandir in Teri town of KP’s district Karak; Hinglaj Mata Mandir in Hingol National Park of Balochistan’s district Lasbela; Katas Raj complex in Punjab’s district Chakwal and Parhlad Bhagat Mandir in Punjab’s district Multan — should be provided with fool-proof security and befitting lodging and boarding arrangements similar to Sri Darbar Sahib Gurdwara in Kartarpur town of Punjab’s district Narowal.
The report highlighted that the devastating action by miscreants on Dec 30 in the presence of police not only hurt the sentiments of the Hindu community in particular and the minority communities in general, but also brought shame to Pakistan by tarnishing the country’s image at the international level.
Built before 1920, the temple in Teri was attacked by a large mob after local elders of a religious party in their fiery speeches at a protest demonstration demanded the removal of the temple.
Taking notice of the incident, Chief Justice of Pakistan Gulzar Ahmed ordered KP’s chief secretary and the police chief as well as Dr Suddle to visit the site and submit a comprehensive report before the court by Jan 4.
The case will be taken up for hearing on Jan 5.
Dr Suddle, in his report, highlighted that the mob had also looted the available valuables from the temple after setting the site on fire but the station house officer and deputy superintendent of police concerned apparently did not take any action to control the situation.
The DSP offered the explanation that had he ordered the use of force, the situation would have gone totally out of control resulting in huge casualties and loss of life. Both the police officers were suspended by the police chief pending a thorough probe into the incident.
The report expressed the need of proper and thorough investigations at the earliest after gathering available evidence, including forensic evidence and call records. It suggested an in-depth investigation by the provincial government and police chief.
Moreover, Maulvi Mohammad Sharif, the principal instigator of the demolition of the temple, the report recommended, must be thoroughly interrogated to unearth any conspiracy and planning behind the gory incident. The real motive for the attack needed to be laid bare for future, it said.
The miscreants who vandalised the temple deserved exemplary punishment to create strong deterrence in future, the report suggested, while regretting the handling of the incident by police.
The Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB), in coordination with the KP government, must also take immediate measures for repossessing any illegally occupied land that belongs to the mandir as well as any other evacuee property in the country, the report said, adding the actual area of the Shri Param Hans Ji Maharaj at the time of partition should also be determined, keeping in view any tampering with the revenue or other records.
There should be a proper administrative set-up of the mandir, the report emphasised, adding that the home department must ban entry of suspected miscreants in the temple area.
The report also highlighted that the well situated within the precincts of the temple, as well as the orchard, has dried up because of lack of maintenance. The well used to fulfil the water requirements of not only the mandir but also the local inhabitants of Teri, thus rendering the water as sacred for the Hindu community.
It highlighted that the well and the historic orchard where Param Hans Ji Mahaaraj used to sit along with his Hindu disciples and Muslims of the area alike, needs to be properly rehabilitated.
The report said the Hindu community in the Teri area sho­uld enjoy all the rights as guaranteed to them by the Consti­tution without any restrictions.
It mentioned that during the meetings of the commission with the KP chief secretary, IG Police, Home Secretary, Kohat Commissioner, Kohat regional police officer, Karak deputy commissioner and Karak district police officer, the issue of visible improvement in the treatment of the minorities and its impact on Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and forums such as the United States Commission on International Religious Freedoms and the UN Office of High Commission on Human Rights was also discussed at length.
The report said the incident highlighted that more sensitization of people across Pakistan on these critical issues was required.",Pakistan
"World asked to take notice of HR violations in held Kashmir
","January 5, 2021","			
ISLAMABAD: Federal Minister for Human Rights Dr Shireen Mazari on Monday called upon the international community to take notice of human rights violations in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir.
Addressing a press conference along with the family members of imprisoned Kashmiri freedom fighter Asiya Andrabi, she urged the United Nations, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch as well as women organisations including the International Women Caucuses to take action on the issue.
			
Ms Mazari said Asiya Andrabi, along with Fehmida Sufi and Naheeda Nasreen, had been imprisoned in Delhi’s Tihar jail.
She said that imprisoning Dr Ashiq Hussain Faktoo, the longest serving political prisoner, Asiya Andrabi and Syed Ali Gilani, Shabir Ahmed Shah, Ashraf Sehrani, Dr Fayyaz, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, Yasin Malik and Musarrat Alam Bhat in occupied Kashmir’s prisons and the notorious Tihar Jail was a complete violation of Article 49.
The detention of these prisoners was also a war crime under Article 82 (2b, VIII) of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), read with Article 143 of Geneva Convention IV, she added.
In a related development, Prime Minis­ter Imran Khan reiterated Pakistan’s support for the people of occupied Kashmir.
In a series of tweets, he said: “On 5th January 1949, the United Nations guaranteed the right to self-determination for the people of Jammu and Kashmir through an impartial plebiscite. We observe this day as a reminder to the UN & its member states of their unfulfilled commitment to the Kashmiri people.
			
“Despite suffering 73 years of brutal Indian occupation, generation after generation of the Kashmiri people remain steadfast in the demand for their inalienable right to self-determination as guaranteed to them under the UN Charter and by the UNSC.
“We call on the international community to take action against the well-documented human rights violations being committed with impunity by Indian Occupation forces against innocent Kashmiri men, women & children; & to ensure Kashmiris get their right to self determination.

Furnace oil sales clocked into 1.626m tonnes, up by 38pc in the first half of 2020-21, while petrol and HSD sales stood at 4.103m tonnes and 3.743m tonnes, up by seven and 11pc as compared to July-December period of FY20.
According to Syed Fawad Bashir at Topline Securities, total oil sales rose by 16pc in December year-on-year driven by FO demand whose sales swelled by 108pc to 240,000 tonnes on account of high demand from the power sector given gas shortage during winter and overall pick up in economic activities following improvement in Covid-19 situation.
HSD and petrol sales in December stood at 622,000 tonnes and 673,000 tonnes posting a jump of 13pc and five per cent.
Increase in HSD and petrol can be attributed to rising automobile sales to brisk automotive sales coupled with increasing goods movement relating to export and import and positive trend in factory output as per figures of large-scale manufacturing (LSM).

"Gas diversions pose risk to food security, warn fertiliser makers
","January 5, 2021","ISLAMABAD: The fertiliser industry has protested over a recent decision of the Cabinet Committee on Energy (CCoE) to divert natural gas to pipeline system from Mari Gas and has sought its reconsideration to ensure required fertiliser production and protect the country’s agriculture sector.
The “decision of the CCoE, whereby gas is being provided from the Mari Gas fields to the network through a new interconnection, is a grave threat to the country’s food security in the long term since this would not only hasten the depletion of indigenous resources but also put at risk the billions of dollars of investment”, said Fertiliser Manufacturers of Pakistan Advisory Council (FMPAC).
In letters to ministers of industries & production, national food security, planning & development and energy, the FMPAC also warned that this will eventually cause unemployment in the country of those related to the industry directly and indirectly.
The CCoE had decided on Nov 26, 2020 to ensure additional 50 million cubic feet per day of natural gas from Mari Field to the Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd (SNGPL) system by early January and installation of compression facility by Mari Petroleum on its field to ensure its continuous supplies.
The FMPAC said the Habib Rahi Limestone (HRL) reservoir of the Mari Field was a medium heating value gas with high carbon dioxide and nitrogen contents, which make it beneficial for the production of urea fertiliser by the facilities specifically designed for such purposes, but inversely affect the efficiency of any power plant.
Utilisation of this gas as fuel is an uneconomical mode, a fact that had been realised under Fertiliser Policy 2001.
In the past, the government had decided to allocate a certain portion of this gas to Guddu Power Plant which was in itself a debatable decision because of the very low efficiencies of the power plant. “Now the supply to SNGPL is contradictory to the stated policies of GoP and counterproductive for the long-term assurance of our national food security,” the letter said. It claimed that every 100mmcfd transferred from HRL will meet only two per cent of the current natural gas requirement in the country but will chip away nearly 20pc of the fertiliser sector’s natural gas requirements in coming years.
The fertiliser industry has requested the relevant ministries to have a fresh look at the long-term viability of both the domestic industries as well as national food security.
“While the impact of this diversion of domestic gas to the SNGPL network may not have visible effects in short term, it definitely threatens the national food security and billions rupees of loss in taxes due to the early closure of domestic industry,” it said while adding that it was not prudent to divert gas away from the long-term needs of agriculture sector to meet short-term needs of network consumers.
A government official said there was no urgency for the government or the CCoE to reconsider the decision as natural gas supply to fertiliser industry was never a priority in winter months when entire focus was to ensure maximum supplies even from imports to the residential consumers.
He said the CCoE had been given a clear picture of the fertiliser stock position and gas supplies to even Punjab-based fertiliser plants was ensured until mid-November.
The fertiliser industry has also questioned the use of natural gas as fuel in power plants, general industries and domestic sector saying the gas was a key component of country’s energy mix but unfortunately the share of value-added products from gas was extremely low.
Fertiliser was the only industry in the country using natural gas for value-added purposes in sizeable quantities that remain a key source of national food security and hence all the past governments allocated certain priority to indigenous fertiliser production. Dedication of Mari shallow gas for fertiliser under the Fertiliser Policy 2001 was part of this philosophy.
It said there could be arguments for importing fertilisers for domestic use but their availability at the right time and at the right price could never be assured.
Besides the importance of agriculture in terms of economy and employment, “food insecurity is anticipated to reach nearly 60pc country-wide in 2030 if positive steps are not taken to enhance domestic production of food commodities” for which domestic fertiliser was a must, said the fertiliser industry.",Newspaper
"Iran confirms it is enriching uranium to 20pc at Fordow
","January 5, 2021","Iran confirmed on Tuesday it is now enriching uranium to 20 per cent purity, well beyond the threshold set by its 2015 nuclear deal with major powers, sparking international concern.
The move at its underground Fordow facility was also confirmed by UN watchdog the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
It was the most striking suspension yet of Iranian commitments under the 
, a process it started in 2019 in response to US President Donald Trump's 
 from the accord the previous year.
“At around 7pm (1530 GMT on Monday), we reached 20pc” enrichment, spokesman Behrouz Kamalavandi told state television in an interview aired on Tuesday.
Announcing the move on Monday, government spokesman Ali Rabiei said President Hassan Rouhani had ordered the enrichment “in recent days” in line with a law passed last month by the conservative-dominated parliament.
The law “for the lifting of sanctions and protection of the Iranian people's interests” mandates Rouhani's government to “produce and store 120 kilogrammes (265 pounds) per year of uranium enriched to 20pc”.
Foreign Minister Javad Zarif tweeted that “we resumed 20pc enrichment as legislated by our parliament,” adding that the IAEA had been “
”.
			
He stressed that Tehran took the step “after years of non-compliance” by other parties and that “our measures are fully reversible upon full compliance by all”.
The step comes less than three weeks before the end of the presidency of Trump, who has sought to economically punish and diplomatically isolate Iran with a “maximum pressure” campaign, including tough sanctions.
The outgoing administration deplored Iran's plan to step up uranium enrichment. “Iran enriching uranium to 20pc at Fordow is a clear attempt to increase its campaign of nuclear extortion, an attempt that will continue to fail,” a State Department spokesperson said.
The Iranian government has signalled a readiness to engage with US President-elect Joe Biden, who takes office on January 20 and has expressed willingness to return to diplomacy with Tehran.
Iran's return to enrichment of uranium to 20pc purity has triggered international concern because it is seen as a significant step towards the 90pc level required for a nuclear weapon.
The IAEA confirmed that “Iran today began feeding uranium already enriched up to 4.1pc U-235 into six centrifuge cascades at the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant for further enrichment up to 20pc”.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reacted angrily and said it proved Iran is seeking to build an atomic bomb — a claim the Islamic republic has always denied.
“Iran's decision to continue violating its commitments, to raise the enrichment level and advance the industrial ability to enrich uranium underground, cannot be explained in any way except as the continued realisation of its intention to develop a military nuclear programme,” Netanyahu said in a statement.
“Israel will not allow Iran to manufacture nuclear weapons.”
The European Union said Iran's enrichment programme would be a “considerable departure” from the deal.
Russia's envoy to the IAEA said that Moscow is “not enthusiastic” about Tehran's move but emphasised that “there is nothing to overdramatise”.
			
“The nuclear programme remains fully transparent and verifiable,” Mikhail Ulyanov wrote on Twitter. “We should focus on means to restore comprehensive implementation of the nuclear deal.”
Meanwhile, China's foreign ministry urged calm and restraint. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, speaking to reporters, said all parties should avoid taking steps that could exacerbate tensions.
Iran had on December 31 informed the IAEA that it would begin producing uranium enriched to up to 20pc, the level it had before the nuclear deal was reached.
According to the latest IAEA report available, published in November, Tehran was previously enriching uranium to levels greater than the limit provided for in the 2015 Vienna agreement (3.67pc) but not exceeding the 4.5pc threshold, and still complied with the agency's strict inspection regime.
But there has been turmoil since the 
 in late November of Iranian nuclear physicist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh.
In the aftermath of the attack, blamed on Israel, hardliners in Tehran pledged a response and the conservative-dominated parliament passed the new law.
Rouhani had opposed the legislation, describing it as “detrimental to the course of diplomatic activities”.
Quoted by the government's website, Rabiei said that the administration's stance towards the law is clear, “but the government considers itself bound to carry out the law”.",World
"Saudi Arabia says full ties restored between Qatar and embargo nations
","January 5, 2021","Full ties have been restored between Qatar and the four nations that severed relations with Doha in a rift that began over three years ago, Saudi Arabia's foreign minister said on Tuesday.
Saudi Arabia led a coalition of countries in the Gulf and beyond that cut ties and transport links with Qatar in June 2017, charging that it was too close to Iran and backed radical Islamist groups — allegations Doha has always denied.
“What happened today is ... the turning of the page on all points of difference and a full return of diplomatic relations,” Prince Faisal bin Farhan told a press conference at the conclusion of a landmark regional summit in Saudi Arabia.
Saudi state media said that de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met separately with Qatar's ruler Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, after the pair publicly embraced at the airport.
“During the meeting, they reviewed bilateral relations between the two brotherly countries and ways of consolidating the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) joint action,” the official 
 said.
Leaders of the six-member GCC signed two documents on Tuesday, the Al-Ula Declaration, named after the Saudi city where this year's regional summit was held, and a final communique.
Three GCC members — Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain — took part in the three-and-a-half-year blockade, alongside Egypt.
Qatar is also a GCC member state, along with Kuwait and Oman, which remained neutral in the spat.
The documents are general in terms, but Prince Mohammed said earlier that the Gulf states had inked an agreement that affirms “our Gulf, Arab and Islamic solidarity and stability”.
He called for unity to confront challenges facing the region, singling out “the threats posed by the Iranian regime's nuclear and ballistic missile programme and its plans for sabotage and destruction.”  
The summit comes a day after it was 
 that Saudi Arabia would reopen its airspace and sea and land border to Qatar under the deal signed today.
Under the agreement, Qatar will suspend lawsuits related to the boycott, a senior US official earlier said.
All of the countries are US allies. Qatar hosts the region's largest US military base, Bahrain is home to the US Navy's Fifth Fleet, and Saudi Arabia and the UAE host US troops.
The development is the latest in a series of Middle East deals sought by Washington — the others involving Israel and Arab states — aimed at building a united front against Iran.
White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, assigned to work on the dispute by US President Donald Trump, also attended the ceremony in the historical city of Al-Ula along with Middle East envoy Avi Berkowitz and Brian Hook, a special State Department adviser.
Meanwhile, the Foreign Office (FO) on Tuesday issued a statement welcoming the decision by Saudi Arabia and Qatar to reopen land, air and sea borders between the two countries.
			
""We also appreciate other steps being taken by the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council, which will contribute to the resolution of outstanding issues between the countries of the organisation persisting for almost four years.
""Pakistan lauds the positive role played by the Emir of Kuwait towards the resolution of the differences between the countries of the council. His persistent and sincere efforts, and cooperation of the GCC countries, led to this important and amicable outcome,"" a statement by the FO spokesman said.
""We hope that the GCC Summit, being held today in Riyadh, will further build on these encouraging developments and lead to enhanced confidence and cooperation among the countries of the organisation.""

"12 importers involved in artificial oil crisis, Senate body told
","January 15, 2021","ISLAMABAD: The Senate Standing Committee on Interior was informed on Thursday that the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) had found 12 top oil importers directly involved in artificial crisis of petroleum products to mint money in connivance with some government functionaries last year.
A meeting of the committee presided over by Senator Rehman Malik was briefed by the petroleum secretary and the FIA additional director general on the artificial shortage of oil with reference to the failure of the departments concerned to control corruption and hoarding by the oil marketing companies (OMCs) which had caused inconvenience and unrest all over the country.
It was informed that the artificial shortage was created by oil importers as diesel was imported illegally from Iran by using forged documents. The committee was apprised that the artificial shortage and stockpiling of petroleum products were a major problem which caused a loss of billions of rupees to the national exchequer.
It was revealed that the owners of some firms had their networks of oil smugglers in Dubai and the United Kingdom.
In June last year, the country witnessed a repeat of the 2015 petroleum shortage. The reason was, once again, the falling global prices and the attempt by the oil industry to avoid inventory losses.
According to media reports, the supply chain has always been dependent on smuggling — by some companies and dealers — from Iran with around 5,000 tonnes daily imports or 150,000 tonnes monthly supplies.
It was also decided by the Senate committee that an in-camera meeting would be held next week where the FIA will brief on the mechanism the oil importers used for the artificial shortage and the benefit drawn out of it. A subcommittee of the standing committee will also be constituted to look into the details and all those officials who were involved in the crime will be taken to task.
Some points have been identified in Dubai, the UK, Singapore, Malta where the money has been illegally transferred which will be dealt with under the money laundering laws and fraud.
The chairman of the committee said that after submission of a final report by the FIA and Ministry of Petroleum, the committee will invite Prime Minister Imran Khan to discuss findings of the inquiry by the FIA.
The committee gave a detailed questionnaire to the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority chairman and asked him to come up with a comprehensive plan to stop the shortage of oil in future.
The committee also took up a matter regarding alarming spread, sale and use of a new drug “Zombie” in Pakistan, particularly in big cities. The drug is highly intoxicating and makes the addict very aggressive.
The committee recommended that the drug should be added to the category of heroin and its possession, use and sale may invite punishment equivalent to that of heroin.",Newspaper
"Inquiry committee formed to probe nationwide outage
","January 15, 2021","ISLAMABAD: The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Thursday constituted a three-member committee to probe into the major power breakdown that plunged the whole country into darkness last weekend.
In a notification issued here on Thursday, Nepra said that the inquiry committee comprising two private sector experts would be required to submit a report to the regulator within 15 days (till Jan 29).
The committee is led by Nepra’s Director General Nadir Ali Khoso and comprised of former manager of the National Transmission and Dispatch Company (NTDC) Manu Ram and former chief engineer of NTDC’s System Protection Khalid Mahmood.
Before retirement, Mr Ram looked after the 500/200KV GSO (Grid Station Operation) of the national grid while Mr Mahmood led the grid’s System Protection.
The committee would determine the causes and faults which resulted in the cascade tripping and system collapse and fix responsibility for the major power breakdown. The body will also review whether restoration efforts were adequate and the power supply was restored within the reasonable time.
Moreover, the committee is also required to go through the findings of inquiry reports of such break downs in the past and see if the recommendations of past probes had been implemented and what lacunae or areas had been left out.
The committee has also been asked to recommend remedial measures to be taken by the relevant agencies and companies to avoid recurrence of such events in the future. The committee has been authorised to associate professionals of Nepra or industry experts for assistance and support is so required.
While the management of the Central Power Generation Company (CPGC) had immediately suspended its seven officials for negligence that originated power outage at one of its plant switchyard, the NTDC has separately constituted three-member committee of its own officials to ascertain why protection systems failed to respond to the outage and led to countrywide breakdown on Saturday last (Jan 9, 2021).",Newspaper

"Court summons petroleum secy, FIA director over crude oil theft
","January 15, 2021","PESHAWAR: A Peshawar High Court bench on Thursday summoned the federal petroleum secretary and Federal Investigation Agency regional director over a petition of Karak residents seeking cancellation of the licence of an international oil and gas exploration company over the alleged theft of crude oil.
Chief Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan and Justice Syed Arshad Ali fixed Feb 2 for the next hearing into the joint petition of Mujahid Islam and 49 other residents of Banda Daud Shah tehsil.
The bench directed the petroleum secretary and FIA director to appear before it to respond to the claims made by petitioners.
The petitioners requested the court to declare that the people of Karak, Kohat and Hangu, whose properties and lands suffered damage and who faced health hazards and environmental degradation, are entitled to compensation by the provincial and federal governments.
They also prayed the court to pronounce that the Federal Investigation Agency, law-enforcement agencies, federal and provincial revenue authorities, Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority, OGDCL, and federal and provincial anti-corruption bodies are involved in the oil and gas theft and other issues as they safeguard the interest of the exploration company.
Fazal Shah Mohmand and Moazzam Butt, lawyers for the petitioners, said that MOL Pakistan Oil and Gas Company, a subsidiary of the MOL Plc, had started operations in Pakistan after it was awarded an exploration licence and a petroleum concession agreement was made in Feb 1999.
They alleged that the company claimed to be producing 8,000 barrel per day (BPD) of oil in the licensed area, whereas an inquiry conducted by the FIA, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, had found huge discrepancies and corrupt practices in the operation of the company as the production was more than 30,000 BPD.
The lawyers claimed that the matter was also taken up by the National Assembly standing committee on petroleum few years ago.
They added that a meeting of the committee was also held with the representatives of all stakeholders, including district administration, police, FIA, NAB, ministry of petroleum, attending it and that the FIA had claimed that the relevant departments had not been providing them record so as to probe the issue further.
The counsel said the company pressured the government agencies forcing them to put the inquiry in cold storage. They requested the court to call inquiry records to know about the ‘illegal’ acts of the company.
The lawyers also said that all chemicals extracted from wells were dumped so carelessly that they spread around the whole exploration sites attached with Gurguri.
They added that the chemicals were poisonous and polluted water, which adversely affected people as well as wild life.
The counsel that the oil and gas pipelines had been laid by the company from Munzila-1 to Munzila-9 fields through the land of the local residents without obtaining NOC from the government.
They requested the court to declare that the petitioners and other inhabitants of Kohat division including districts of Kohat, Karak and Hangu have a fundamental right to life which included clean drinking water, safe environment, and safety to their lands and livestock.

"German lockdown loopholes under scrutiny as deaths hit new high
","January 15, 2021","			
BERLIN: Germany has too many loopholes in its coronavirus lockdown rules, the head of the country’s disease control agency said as figures published on Thursday showed the highest number of daily deaths since the start of the pandemic.
The Robert Koch Institute said 1,244 deaths from Covid were confirmed in one day up to Thursday, taking the total number to 43,881. There were also 25,164 newly confirmed cases, putting Germany’s total known infections close to two million.
Lothar Wieler, president of the institute, said data indicated people in Germany were travelling more than during the first phase of the pandemic in spring, contributing to the spread. German authorities have imposed restrictions on social contacts, largely closed schools and limited travel for those in areas with high infection rates, but the rules aren’t uniformly enforced across the country’s 16 states. “To me, these measures we’re now taking aren’t a complete lockdown,” said Wieler. “There are still too many exceptions and they aren’t being strictly implemented.”
Officials are considering tougher restrictions to curb the continued rise in infections.
The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases has risen over the past two weeks from 23.36 per 100,000 people on Dec 30 to 26.03 per 100,000 people on Jan 13.
Wieler pointed to the sharp spike in infections recently seen in Ireland as an example of how quickly the outbreak can escalate again if rules are relaxed, especially given the new seemingly more contagious variant of the virus circulating there and in neighboring Britain.",Newspaper

"Sindh Assembly unanimously rejects PMC-conducted MDCAT
","January 14, 2021","KARACHI: The Sindh Assembly on Wednesday rejected the Medical and Dental College Admission Test (MDCAT) conducted by the Pakistan Medical Commission and asked the provincial government to approach the centre to “take back” the test.
Speaking on an admitted adjournment motion moved by Syeda Marvi Faseeh of the Pakistan Peoples Party against “irregularities” in the MDCAT, Health Minster Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho told the house that education was a provincial subject after the 18th Amendment.
She said that it was the first time that the federation conducted the entrance test for admissions in medical colleges as it was being done at the provincial level in the past.
Dr Pechuho said that the provincial government didn’t recognize the PMC as it had severe reservations over the commission’s establishment.
She said that they had moved the apex court against replacement of the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council by the PMC “as it was established after bypassing the jurisdiction”.
 
The health minister was of the view that regulatory bodies were formed in consultation with all stakeholders, adding that provinces’ input was not taken before formation of the PMC.
“We have reservations that as there are no health professionals in the PMC. You (federal government) cannot impose the PMC on us,” she added She said that the defunct PMDC used to give policy and set curriculum for the test that was conducted by respective provincial governments.
“The PMC had assured the court that MDCAT would be conducted as per common syllabus but it was done according to the federal syllabus,” the minister said, adding that 10 questions of the test were ambiguous and the candidates had no clue whatsoever about the exam.
She asserted that education was a provincial subject, but the centre was “unlawfully” trying to take control of it.
She said that the testing system should have been transparent, adding that the provincial government had “crystal-clear” testing mechanism as the students were also provided with the answer keys at the website after the examination.
The health minister said that the province was already facing a shortage of doctors to treat patients and this act would increase the disparity between the required and actual number of doctors.
She said that the medical students of other provinces would go back to their hometowns and start practicing there after completing studies in Sindh and we would be left with acute shortage of doctors.
The minister said that the provincial cabinet had decided that 95 per cent seats in private medical institutions would be reserved for Sindh-domiciled candidates and five per cent to be allocated on reciprocal basis with private institutions of other provinces. 
“You cannot impose PMC on us,” she said.
 
The health minister was critical of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf lawmakers who came up with the arguments to defend the federal government’s act She said that they were not loyal to the province and went against its interests. “If you cannot be loyal to Sindh, why are you sitting here? Go to Islamabad,” she told the PTI members.
She also thanked the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan and Grand Democratic Alliance for supporting the adjournment motion. Sidra Imran of the PTI said that the candidates belonging to Sindh were unable to pass the MDCAT “as they were too weak to match with students of other provinces”.
“How could the Sindh students compete with candidates of other provinces as they are deprived of education,” she said.
She said that around 6.5 million children were out of school in the province as autaqs were established in educational institutions.
Later, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Mukesh Kumar Chawla presented a motion, asking the provincial government to approach the federal government to take back the MDCAT conducted by the PMC.
The motion was carried unanimously.
 
Meanwhile, Labour and Human Resources Minister Saeed Ghani said the provincial government was going to issue the ‘Benazir Mazdoor Card’ from next month.
Replying to the lawmakers’ verbal and written queries during Question Hour, he said that in the pilot project starting from February, the provincial government would issue cards to over 625,000 labourers. “They will also provide social security to the workers,” he added.
Mr Ghani added that as per existing laws, only industrial workers were entitled to the relief by department but now they were bringing amendments to enable all labourers to get the card.
He said that the procedures would be 100 per cent transparent as the card would be equipped with a chip.
Later, Minister Chawla introduced the Millennium Institute of Technology and Entrepreneurship Bill, 2020 and the same was sent to the standing committee for further deliberations.

"India getting three UN bodies not too ominous: diplomats
","January 14, 2021","ISLAMABAD: Pakistani diplomats believe that India getting chair of three United Nations Security Council (UNSC) committees could be looking ominous, but may not be quite as much.  
India, which is on the Security Council as a non-permanent member for 2021-22, has been given the Taliban Sanctions Committee, Counter-Terrorism Committee and Libya Sanctions Committee.  
The announcement was immediately seen as a diplomatic setback for Pakistan because many believed that Delhi would use its presence in the Counter-Terrorism Committee to malign Pakistan, besides complicating the peace process through the Taliban Sanctions Committee.  
But diplomats were of the opinion that there was little for India to be jubilant either because it did not succeed in getting its wish list — the ISIL (Daesh) and Al-Qaeda Sanctions Committee (1267), Non-Proliferation Committee (1540) and Taliban Sanctions Committee (1988), in addition to the Afghan file. India laid claim to the committees being the successor of Indonesia from Asia-Pacific group. Indonesia had earlier held the chair of the three committees.  
The committees that India got instead were as a result of compromise. The 24 UNSC committees are allocated by the five permanent members through an agreement.  
Pakistan to start with did not have enough clout to prevent India from getting committees of its choice, except for China. 
The problem with China too is that it would not have liked to stand out in opposition to the other four members — France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States.  
The Pakistani diplomats, however, contend that they successfully lobbied to prevent India from getting the Daesh and Al-Qaeda Sanctions Committee and Non-Proliferation Committee. Some of the Western members too had concerns over India getting the Non-Proliferation Committee, which made Islamabad’s job easier.  
“India’s presence on the Security Council is in itself problematic for Pakistan, but we have made best out of the worst situation. What they wanted would have harmed us more,” a Pakistani diplomat explained during a background discussion.  
The Counter-Terrorism Committee was given to India in compensation for the Daesh and Al-Qaeda Sanctions Committee. The committee, which will be chaired by India in 2022, was formed in the aftermath of the 9/11 terror attacks. It is a normative committee with a prescriptive role which sets standards on counter-terrorism. Moreover, it has no role with regards to lists and sanctions.  
India would, however, still try to use the committee to target Pakistan. This was obvious from Indian envoy to the UN T.S. Tirumurti’s statement, who said: “The chairing of this committee has special resonance of India, which has not only been in the forefront of fighting terrorism, especially cross-border terrorism, but has also been one of its biggest victims.”  
The Taliban Sanctions Committee had been desired by India, but as its chair it wouldn’t be really in charge. There are two reasons for that — firstly, India would take up the chair when the US has already reached a deal with the Taliban and intra-Afghan dialogue is continuing and, secondly, listing and de-listing are done by the US. Blocking a US move would require a negative consensus of all the 15 members, which is improbable.  
Indians, nevertheless, tried to play this up as well. “The Taliban Sanctions Committee has always been a high priority for India keeping in mind our strong interest and commitment to peace, security, development and progress of Afghanistan,” Tirumurti had said.  
The Libya Sanctions Committee has meanwhile been dysfunctional for the past few years because of differences among the five permanent members. That in any case does not mean that India would not create trouble for Pakistan.  
The mission at the UN in New York has, therefore, worked out what Pakistan’s Permanent Representative Ambassador Munir Akram calls “defensive and offensive strategy” to counter India’s design.  
Another senior diplomat, who has a vast experience of working at the UN, said the Pakistani mission was faced with difficult, but not an impossible task. Pakistani diplomats, he believed, would have to strengthen their networking with other members of the UNSC, especially Niger, Tunisia, Ireland and Mexico, besides keenly following the developments so as to be able to pre-empt something unfavourable.  
“Options are created, they are not presented in a platter,” a diplomat said, adding that days of “armchair diplomacy” were gone.",Newspaper
"Is the economy recovering?
","January 14, 2021","GOING by what we are hearing these days, it seems the country’s economy is in the middle of a rebound, or at least according to the words of government ministers. Planning Minister Asad Umar has been talking about a ‘V-shaped recovery’ since at least August, when the Covid-19 lockdowns were largely gone. Prime Minister Imran Khan has been talking about a ‘recovery’ in the economy since at least November. And the commerce adviser, Razzak Dawood, makes it a point to share export data and congratulate the country on their rising trend every month.
So is it true that the economy is indeed recovering? Consider first that all projections for where the economy will stand by the end of this fiscal year range between 0.5 per cent GDP growth and 2.5pc. The IMF said 1.1pc most recently and the World Bank said 0.5pc only a week ago. The State Bank estimated GDP growth to fall between 1.5pc and 2.5pc, citing the second wave of Covid-19 as a key risk. The International Institute of Finance projected 1.8pc back in August and only today Moody’s forecast GDP growth to come in at 1.5pc by the end of this fiscal year.
You can spin these numbers if you like. A determined soul could argue that since growth was negative last year, even positive 2pc growth this year is an impressive recovery. Or the same determined soul might argue that this trend is likely to accelerate given what is happening in the large-scale manufacturing indicator, which shows accelerating output growth among large manufactures every month.
What you cannot do, however, is refer to 2pc GDP growth as some sort of ‘recovery’, unless by recovery you mean only that the economy has recovered from the jolt of the Covid-19 lockdowns, which didn’t last very long in Pakistan. Even if we double this projection, and argue that by the end of the fiscal year the growing activity we see in industry today will accelerate to the point where it will blow past all projections made by everybody and come in at 4pc (double what the more optimistic projections are showing), even then you don’t have a very sharp ‘recovery’, only a slow grinding return of economic activity after at least two years of moribund performance.
Whenever you hear the government proclaim triumph about rising exports, keep in mind that the trade deficit has grown even faster than exports in the same July to December period. The month of December saw a sharp rise in the trade deficit, up by almost a third from the same month last year, and if the past is any guide, then whenever we have rising periods of growth we also see a rising trade deficit which eventually swamps growth because the foreign exchange reserves deplete. It is too early to say that the December trade figures show a return of this trend though, but if the trade deficit continues rising in the months of January and February, we will be in a position to ask whether yet one more unsustainable growth spurt has been engineered in the country.
Even more importantly, though, whenever we look at the rise in exports we have to ask at what cost these have been brought about. For example, add up all the freebies and handouts the government has given to exporters all through 2020, at an accelerating clip, and then add up all the incremental export proceeds that these chaps have brought back into the country. Between subsidies on fuel, power and credit, the bonanza from a sharp fall in interest rates — that fell to just over half their level in a matter of weeks once the lockdowns began and have remained there ever since — the massive rescheduling of their loans that the State Bank arranged for them, and sharp breaks on taxes and custom duties, you have a figure of almost Rs2 trillion that have been poured into industry as a whole. It is hard to determine how much of this went to exporters specifically, but they are the beneficiaries of a very large share of government largesse.
In return, exports have increased by $574 million in the first six months of the fiscal year compared to the same period last year, equal to around Rs92 billion at an exchange rate of 160. It is difficult to calculate how much largesse the exporters have actually absorbed through all the various ways the government has showered it upon them, but it is a safe bet that it is far larger than Rs92bn.
So what’s going on? I’ve said before that there is rampant under-invoicing of exports going on, and I repeat that once again. These guys are basically taking the prime minister for a ride. It is also possible that many among them are then routing some of this money accumulated abroad via under-invoicing back into the country in the form of remittances, which might help explain why the latter remain elevated above the $2bn level for many months now.
Why would they do this? Because there are enormous benefits for them to bring that money back and pour it into real estate investments instead, since that sector is on the cusp of a boom brought about by nearly Rs186bn of black money entering via an amnesty scheme, coupled with an equally massive set of government handouts.
So no, the economy is not turning around or recovering. It is in the early stages of what might become a growth spasm driven by massive state inducements of the sort we have seen before and which inevitably lead to a crash. And the drivers of that growth are narrowly huddled in property development and allied industries, and textile exports, with some knock-on effects rippling through the system. Investment without savings or expenditures without revenues are like a drug for any economy. Let’s see what happens to this gravy train once the IMF programme resumes.",Newspaper

"Nightlong crackdown in Lahore: Police claim arrest of 60 out of 73 ‘underworld dons’
","January 14, 2021","LAHORE: The Lahore police, launching a massive crackdown on the top-73 ‘underworld dons’ of the city, claims to have raided their houses and dens, arresting a majority of them.
The large-scale operation was carried out late on Tuesday on the basis of updated lists of these highly notorious goons, thugs, land-grabbers and shooters, which were provided to all the divisional superintendents of police (SPs) in the city.
According to police, the crackdown which continued in the wee hours of Wednesday ended with the arrest of the over 60 out of the 73 ‘underworld dons’.
The police lodged 44 first information reports (FIRs) against these criminals, recovering huge caches of sophisticated illegal weapons from them, including Klashnikovs, rifles and pistols, besides thousands of live bullets etc.
As per sources, many of these ‘dons’ were so influential that they had created a ‘state within the state’ and were reportedly being patronised by police officials, lawyers, journalists and politicians.
According to the officially-prepared list of these hardened criminals, several of them had become a ‘symbol of terror’ in the provincial capital. They were also involved in gambling, extortion, murders through hit men and illegally occupying properties of helpless citizens.
“It was a massive exercise that we conducted because these hardened criminals were deciding police cases by setting up their own courts at their dens/outhouses for money,” Senior Superintendent (SSP) of Lahore police investigation wing Abdul Ghaffar Qaisrani told Dawn.
The SSP said the crackdown was launched on the directive of Capital City Police Officer Ghulam Mahmood Dogar.
He said these criminals had enforced a parallel ‘justice system’ and used to settle cases of murder, dacoity, robberies, kidnappings and land-grabbing.
The modus operandi of these criminals was that they used terror as tool to coerce people of their respective areas into bringing their disputes, cases to them for settlement.
“They would take fee/share in cash from them (parties to the disputes) for deciding their cases,” the SSP said, adding they were responsible for the rising trend of crime in the city, creating many legal issues for the police.
He further said the police teams formed in all the six city divisions carried out “fearless raids”, impounded and arrested a majority of the 73 “dons” of the city.
“These 73 hardened thugs were on the list of first and second tier underworld dons that was provided to all the divisional SPs of the city, while ensuring complete secrecy to ensure maximum arrests,” Mr Qaisrani said.
He said many of these criminals were proclaimed offenders, court absconders and wanted in many criminal cases registered against them at various police stations of the city.
Most of them were from the walled city, and were well-connected and dangerous having criminal background.
Of them, 27 were arrested from the city division for terrorising people, particularly in Gawalmandi, Shafiqabad, Shahdara, Lohari, Akbari Gate and Naulakha areas.
“The crackdown and arrests of these goons will help police in creating a sense of security among the people of these areas and in eliminating their underground networks,” the SSP said.
According to the police record, 13 were arrested from the Iqbal Town Division and 12 others from the Civil Lines Division.
The organised crime police also arrested 13 hardened criminals, notorious thugs, proclaimed offenders and court absconders.
Another police official said that one of the criminals arrested from the Walled City was the son of an underworld don of Garhi Shahu, who was allegedly murdered some 10 years back by a hit man hired by his rival group. He said the criminal was running a business in Shahalam Market and the police recovered from his possession seven rifles and a large number of live bullets.
Another suspected criminal from Akbari Gate was the owner of several plazas and was a notorious land-grabber, who had illegally occupied properties on Railway Road and Brandreth Road and used to decide disputes of the area people in a ‘parallel court’.
The police recovered from his possession four cars he had snatched from their owners.
Similarly, five notorious thugs and land-grabbers were arrested from Sanda area. One of them was running business of cable connections, involved in murder cases and was patronising crime dens.
Another arrested suspect was infamous for illegally occupying disputed properties in the area. Recently, a station house officer was transferred on the complaints of getting Rs200,000 monthly bribe from him, the police official said seeking anonymity.",Pakistan
"Irish govt apologises for ‘mother and baby homes’ scandal
","January 14, 2021","DUBLIN: Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin on Wednesday formally apologised for the treatment of unmarried women and their babies in state and church-run homes, where thousands of children died over decades.
But campaigners for the survivors of the homes denounced the official report into the scandal as a “cop out” that played down the role of the church and the state.
Martin told the Dail lower chamber of parliament that residents had suffered a “profound generational wrong” at the so-called “mother and baby homes”.
On Tuesday, a six-year-long inquiry concluded 9,000 children died in the institutions, operating in the historically Catholic nation as recently as 1998.
The Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes (CIMBH) said 56,000 unmarried women and 57,000 children passed through the institutions over 76 years.
Infants suffered an “appalling” 15-percent mortality rate, while the mothers suffered emotional abuse in “cold and seemingly uncaring” conditions.
“I apologise for the shame and stigma which they were subjected to and which, for some, remains a burden to this day,” Martin said.
“I want to emphasise that each of you were in an institution because of the wrongs of others,” he added.
The report revealed “significant failures of the state, the churches and of society”, he said.
The CIMBH report examined 18 homes — a mixture of general “poorhouses” and those expressly for women and children.
They housed unmarried women who became pregnant, were unsupported by partners and family, and faced severe social stigma owing to the mainstream Catholic dogma of society.
Children born in the institutions would often be separated from their mothers and put up for adoption, severing family ties. On Tuesday evening, the country’s most senior Catholic cleric, Primate of All Ireland Archbishop Eamon Martin apologised “unreservedly” for the role of the church in the homes.
“I accept that the church was clearly part of that culture in which people were frequently stigmatised, judged and rejected,” he said. The CIMBH was established in 2015 after an amateur historian uncovered evidence of a potential mass grave of infants at one such home in the west Ireland town of Tuam.
Its findings were highly anticipated by survivors, but there have already been accusations it minimises the role the church and state played.
A summary said responsibility for harsh treatment of the women “rests mainly with the fathers of their children and their own immediate families” but was “supported by... the state and the churches”.
While it said there was “no evidence” in most cases that women were made to give their children up for adoption or were forced to enter the homes, it admitted that “most women had no alternative”. But campaigners denounced the report as a “cop out”.
“The families were pressurised by church and state,” Paul Redmond, chair of the Coalition of Mother and Baby Home Survivors, said.
“It was official policy in this country right up to 1974 to essentially separate single mothers and their children.” Between 10,000 and 15,000 “illegally adopted” from the homes have been “completely ignored” in the findings.",Newspaper
"Shahzad Akbar serves PML-N's Uzma Bukhari legal notice for 'defamatory statements'

Bukhari was referring to a

""Moussavi said Shahzad Akbar along with another person came to him (Moussavi) and [both] were asking for their cut,"" the notice quoted Bukhari as saying. ""This is a very important thing. They asked for a cut for themselves, not the government. They said 'what will [you] give us? We will extend your contract'. This is a very big allegation [...] for a government office-bearer who is with the government.
""Shahzad Akbar's history of taking and giving briefcase is old [...] and this is not an allegation.""
In a recent interview, a full recording of which is available with 
, Moussavi had alleged that an individual who he had met with Akbar in 2018 regarding a $1 billion bank account was more interested in getting his cut than in investigating suspects. The Broadsheet owner added, however, that Akbar may not have been aware of this individual’s question about a commission.
Denying this in a

In the notice served to Bukhari yesterday, Akbar insisted he had been a ""target of hateful media campaigns from members of the PML-N and other opposition parties"" which are run in order to ""discourage him from the pro-active role he is playing in curbing corruption and ensuring accountability"". 
The notice said Moussavi had ""stated at many occasions that [Akbar] is a man of integrity"". It added that Bukhari had levelled the allegations against Akbar in order to ""sabotage the anti-corruption drive"" and mislead the public. 
The PM's adviser also rejected Bukhari's accusation that he ""misappropriates public funds [...] and is involved in the offence of accepting and giving bribes"". The notice also stated that Akbar had never been the prosecutor general of the National Accountability Bureau as claimed by Bukhari. 
Akbar demanded Bukhari to retract her statements and issue an apology or pay Rs500 million in damages. In a tweet, Akbar said money collected in damages would go to charities.

, a UK company that was registered in the Isle of Man in the Pervez Musharraf era, helped the then government and newly established NAB track down foreign assets purchased by Pakistanis through alleged ill-gotten wealth.
Broadsheet claims that it was established to enter into an Asset Recovery Agreement dated June 20, 2000, and did so with the then president of Pakistan, through the NAB chairman, for the purposes of recovering funds and other assets fraudulently taken from the state and other institutions, including through corrupt practices, and held outside of Pakistan.
Broadsheet maintains that it was created to be a company specialising in the recovery of assets and funds, and was therefore engaged to trace, locate and transfer such items back to the state. The firm came to light earlier this month when a British court ordered that $28.7 million be paid to Broadsheet from the Pakistan High Commission in the United Kingdom. 
The 
, signed in 2000 by Gen Muhammad Amjad, the head of NAB appointed by Gen Pervez Musharraf, maintained that the firm would receive 20 per cent of the assets recovered, with the remainder going to NAB.
The contract gave Broadsheet the authority to initiate litigation or enforcement proceedings deemed necessary to seize assets on behalf of NAB.
NAB and Broadsheet also agreed to open a bank account which would be jointly controlled by NAB and the company, and it was agreed that all assets proceeds recovered would be deposited in the account.
The agreement also stated that the contract was binding on respective successors.
A lawyer associated with the company earlier told 
 that the Sharifs were the “top target” of the Broadsheet investigation. The contract was terminated in 2003 by NAB.

"Australia to kill pigeon that crossed the Pacific from US state of Oregon
","January 14, 2021","A racing pigeon has survived an extraordinary 13,000-kilometre Pacific Ocean crossing from the United States to find a new home in Australia. Now authorities consider the bird a quarantine risk and plan to kill it.
Kevin Celli-Bird said on Thursday he discovered the exhausted bird that arrived in his Melbourne backyard on December 26 had disappeared from a race in the US state of Oregon on October 29.
Experts suspect the pigeon that Celli-Bird has named Joe, after the US president-elect, hitched a ride on a cargo ship to cross the Pacific.
Joe’s feat has attracted the attention of the Australian media but also of the notoriously strict Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service.
Celli-Bird said quarantine authorities called him on Thursday to ask him to catch the bird.
“They say if it is from America, then they’re concerned about bird diseases,” he said. “They wanted to know if I could help them out. I said, ’To be honest, I can’t catch it. I can get within 500 mil (millimetres or 20 inches) of it and then it moves.’”
He said quarantine authorities were now considering contracting a professional bird catcher.
The Agriculture Department, which is responsible for biosecurity, said the pigeon was “not permitted to remain in Australia” because it “could compromise Australia’s food security and our wild bird populations”.
“It poses a direct biosecurity risk to Australian bird life and our poultry industry,” a department statement said.
In 2015, the government threatened to euthanise two Yorkshire terriers, Pistol and Boo, after they were smuggled into the country by Hollywood star Johnny Depp and his ex-wife Amber Heard.
Faced with a 50-hour deadline to leave Australia, the dogs made it out in a chartered jet.
Pigeons are an unusual sight in Celli-Bird’s backyard in suburban Officer, where Australian native doves are far more common.
“It rocked up at our place on Boxing Day. I’ve got a fountain in the backyard and it was having a drink and a wash. He was pretty emaciated so I crushed up a dry biscuit and left it out there for him,” Celli-Bird said.
“Next day, he rocked back up at our water feature, so I wandered out to have a look at him because he was fairly weak and he didn’t seem that afraid of me and I saw he had a blue band on his leg. Obviously he belongs to someone, so I managed to catch him,” he added.
Celli-Bird, who says he has no interest in birds “apart from my last name”, said he could no longer catch the pigeon with his bare hands since it had regained its strength.
He said the Oklahoma-based American Racing Pigeon Union had confirmed that Joe was registered to an owner in Montgomery, Alabama.
Celli-Bird said he had attempted to contact the owner, but had so far been unable to get through.
The bird spends every day in the backyard, sometimes sitting side-by-side with a native dove on a pergola. Celli-Bird has been feeding it pigeon food from within days of its arrival.
“I think that he just decided that since I’ve given him some food and he’s got a spot to drink, that’s home,” he said.
Australian National Pigeon Association secretary Brad Turner said he had heard of cases of Chinese racing pigeons reaching the Australian west coast aboard cargo ships, a far shorter voyage.
Turner said there were genuine fears pigeons from the US could carry exotic diseases and he agreed Joe should be destroyed.
“While it sounds harsh to the normal person — they’d hear that and go: ‘this is cruel,’ and everything else — I’d think you’d find that A.Q.I.S. and those sort of people would give their wholehearted support for the idea,” Turner said, referring to the quarantine service.
It is claimed that the greatest long-distance flight recorded by a pigeon is one that started at Arras in France and ended in Saigon, Vietnam, back in 1931, according to pigeonpedia.com. The distance was 11,600 kilometres (7,200 miles) and took 24 days.
There are some known instances of long-distance flights but whether these are one-offs performed by the marathon runners of the pigeon world or they are feats that could be achieved by the average pigeon is not known.",World

Meanwhile, another soldier was martyred in an exchange of fire with Indian troops from across the Line of Control (LoC), it added.
In the first incident, security forces carried out two separate intelligence-based operations (IBOs) on terrorist hideouts in North Waziristan. Two suspected terrorists ""including an IED (improvised explosive device) expert"" were killed in the raids, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.

"Payment of Rs84m to UK firm fighting cases against Altaf okayed
","January 21, 2021","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Wednesday approved payment of over Rs84 million (£385,000) to a British law firm fighting cases against disgraced former chief of Muttahidda Qaumi Movement Altaf Hussain. 
This is in addition to about Rs51m (about £233,450) already paid to the firm for the period between February and October 2018. With this, total payments so far to the firm amount to about Rs135m.
In this regard, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) on Wednesday approved “payment of Rs67.459 million to Ministry of Interior (MOI) for the payment to hired solicitors for pursuing cases in the UK,” said a statement issued by the ministry of finance. 
The ministry had originally demanded payment of about Rs84m (£385,000) to M/s Guernica International. However, due to limitations in legal and financial rules, the ECC approved a supplementary grant of Rs67.459m while the interior ministry will separately make a payment of about Rs16.4m (£75,000) out of its own budget. 
As such, a supplementary grant of Rs67.459m (£310,000) was approved to discharge the liabilities of second engagement period from February 2019 to January 2020. The remaining amount of Rs16.4m (£75,000) of the first contract for the period between November 2018 and January 2019 will be paid by the ministry out of its own budget. 
M/s Guernica International was hired to pursue cases like Dr Imran Farooq murder case, money laundering case and incitement to violence case against Altaf Hussain. The contract for legal services between the law firm and the government of Pakistan, through the interior ministry, was signed at the rate of £25,000 per month for a period of 12 months with effect from Feb 14, 2018. 
An amount of £133,450 for the period between February 2018 and June 2018 was cleared in March 2019 with the approval of the federal cabinet. Another amount of £100,000 for July-October 2018 was also paid in December last year. 
Meanwhile, the law firm continued working on the cases and sought renewal of the contract for another term of 12 months from February 2019. The renewal is pending and liabilities remain outstanding due to audit objection that engagement of the law firm had not been done in compliance with procurement rules and had not been processed through law ministry and Attorney General for Pakistan. Hence even earlier payments were found irregular. 
The ECC was told that “being a sensitive issue, the process was carried out as per PPRA Rule 42 (C) by institutions associated with the national security and after evaluation of the British law firm M/s Guernica International possessing requisite credentials was shortlisted” and the office of Attorney General of Pakistan remained associated with the exercise. “Law Ministry was also part of the process in a sense that services of Khawaja Imtiaz were hired by the Ministry as Assistant Attorney General/Special Public Prosecutor to represent federal Government in the cases against Altaf Hussain”.",Newspaper

"Farewell Roosevelt Hotel
","January 21, 2021","LET me start with an apology. If you’re still busy absorbing the full magnitude of the sheer stupidity that went into the making of the Broadsheet scandal, I have more bad news for you. The Roosevelt Hotel in Manhattan as well as the Scribe Hotel in Paris, both iconic landmarks in their respective cities and prized assets of the national airline, have been seized (or ‘charged’ in legal language) by a court order in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) as settlement of the liability to the Tethyan Copper Company (TCC) to whom Pakistan lost an international arbitration case after cancelling the contract that awarded them the Reko Diq gold and copper mines.
Here is what the BVI court said. “The following property in the Territory be provisionally charged … to secure the sum of $3,114,339,607.50 namely a) 100% of the shares in the capital of PIA Investments Limited BVI Company … b) 100% of the shares in the capital of PIA Hotels Limited ... c) 40% of the shares in the capital of Minhal Incorporated….”
It continues: “To the extent that the Shares yield or pay income, dividends or other forms of value, the provisional charge shall extend to” all of these as well. The court has scheduled a hearing on this “provisional charging order” for March 15, and the Attorney General’s office is already on record saying they will fight the order. PIA is a listed company and has not yet made any announcement to its shareholders via the Pakistan Stock Exchange website about this provisional charging order. But the order itself is public information.
In July, plans were finalised for a joint venture under a long lease via a cabinet committee decision and the Roosevelt Hotel was placed on the active privatisation programme. By August, they were talking about a proposed transaction structure, hiring of financial advisers and inviting expressions of interest from domestic and international parties for interest in a long lease on the Roosevelt Hotel and making the investments necessary to convert it into a mixed use facility. Some reported estimates that fluttered through the news flow during these days said the required investment could approach $1 billion. This was no small transaction they were seeking to undertake.
In September, the Economic Coordination Committee, another cabinet body, approved the allocation of $142 million for settling various “financial requirements” of the hotel. By October, the news broke that the hotel would be closing its doors permanently, fixed on their website along with a sentimental farewell note. The news was denied vehemently at first, the notice on the website removed, but later it proved to be true. A few weeks later, the CEO of PIA told a Senate committee that the hotel will be closed for “renovation” on Dec 31.
But today, the hotel’s website is barren, carrying only a note that says “[w]e thank you for letting us be part of the very best of New York for the last 100 years. We leave you with this thought….” and there follows some sort of an inspirational quote from Theodore Roosevelt. This doesn’t sound much like a “closed for renovation” type of announcement to me, but who knows. And what does it matter anymore anyway?
In the meanwhile, the committee arbitrating Pakistan’s dispute with TCC ruled in October that the copper mining firm could proceed with collecting half of the award amount and the next month TCC filed for attachment of PIA properties in a BVI court, where the said companies of the national carrier are incorporated.
Those hearings began in November 2020 when the TCC sought enforcement of the international tribunal’s order and asked a high court in BVI to ‘charge’ PIA properties in response to an arbitral award that gave them the power to seize government of Pakistan properties around the world. Hearings around that are now in progress and the attorney general is on record with robust statements of confidence, saying they will challenge this order and hope to win.
One wishes them the best of luck. But in the meanwhile, it is worth noting that massive plans have been upended, and even more importantly, massive assets are now on the verge of being seized. Let’s recall that in both cases — that of Broadsheet as well as the Reko Diq mines — what brought us to this pass is when some crusading individual at some point in the distant past thought that they will embark on a personal drive to rid the country of corruption.
This might sound like a noble intention, but look at how they went about doing it. In the case of Broadsheet, they ended up paying a penalty that was larger than the amount they sought to recover, simply because what was supposed to be a drive against ill-gotten assets was revealed to be more an exercise in political blackmail. Once the objectives of the blackmail were achieved, they thought they could simply cut themselves loose from the contractual obligations they had entered into along the way, not realising that in some parts of the world you cannot do that.
In the case of Reko Diq, a massive contract was annulled on a technicality so minute most people would have a hard time recalling what it was. Along the way, the PPP government moved to sell the Roosevelt Hotel to pay for PIA losses in preparation for possible privatisation but was restrained from doing so on objections that the price they were aiming to fetch was too low. The PML-N government sought an out-of-court settlement with TCC back in 2014, but were restrained from doing so, with some folks asking ‘why is the government in a hurry to pay TCC’?
The result is that today we are on the verge of losing the hotel which will pay only a fraction of the award. The righteous brigade should sober up and tally up the costs of what they have done.",Newspaper

 that six or seven firetrucks had reached the site, spread over 100 acres.
Three people were reported to have been rescued from the blaze, with another unaccounted for.
“Thick smoke is hampering the work of bringing the fire under control,” the fire brigade told

The complex where the fire broke out is a few minutes drive from the facility where the coronavirus vaccines are produced, reports said.
Eight or nine buildings are under construction at the complex to enhance its manufacturing capability,

Serum Institute — founded in 1966 by Cyrus Poonawalla — is the world's largest vaccine manufacturer by volume, producing 1.5 billion doses a year even before the coronavirus pandemic.
It makes vaccines against polio, diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, measles, mumps and rubella, which are exported to more than 170 countries.
The company has spent nearly a billion dollars in recent years enlarging and improving the giant Pune campus.

India began one of the world's biggest vaccine rollouts on Saturday, aiming to vaccinate 300 million people by July with both Covishield and Covaxin.
Many other countries are relying on the Serum Institute to supply them with the vaccine.
India 
 its first batch on Wednesday — to Bhutan and the Maldives — followed by two million doses to Bangladesh and a million to Nepal.
The country plans to offer 20m doses to its South Asian neighbours, with Latin America, Africa and Central Asia next in line.
Serum Institute also plans to supply 200m doses to Covax, a World Health Organisation-backed effort to procure and distribute inoculations to poor countries.

The chief of army staff, who was received by ISI Director General Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, was given a comprehensive briefing on the regional and national security situation during the visit.
Gen Bajwa ""appreciated the tireless efforts of ISI for national security and expressed his satisfaction over professional preparedness"" of the agency, according to the Inter-Services Public Relations.

"PM briefed on efforts to engage more firms for Covid vaccine
","January 20, 2021","ISLAMABAD: As the Cabinet Committee on Procurement of Covid-19 Vaccine on Tuesday briefed Prime Minister Imran Khan on the efforts being made to engage more pharmaceutical companies for procurement of the vaccine, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) expressed serious concern over the federal government’s decision to ask provinces and the private sector to import the vaccine. 
The prime minister was informed that two vaccines had been registered for emergency use and efforts for fast-track registration of more vaccines were under way.  
Mr Khan was also informed that that the vaccine would be available within the first quarter of the current year. 
Meanwhile, the HRCP said that the federal government’s decision to allow provinces and the private sector to procure the vaccine for Covid-19 was not the right step as it was the responsibility of the federal government to provide vaccines at heavily subsidised rates to the poor masses which formed a majority of the country’s population. 
“The people of lower income group are struggling hard to survive the unprecedented economic crisis unleashed by misplaced priorities and pro-rich policies of the federal government. The foreign aid received and funding allocated for fighting the pandemic must be used transparently and spent on vaccinating the citizens,” the HRCP said. 
The HRCP expressed concern after reports appearing in the electronic and social media that some of the agents in Karachi had started pre-booking of AstraZeneca vaccine for Rs 20,000 per dose. 
When 
 contacted a man named Usman, whose number was being circulated in health circles as the person responsible for making booking for the vaccine, he asked if a single dose of the vaccine was required or all members of the family needed it. When Mr Usman later came to know that the caller was from Islamabad, he said the vaccine would be available once the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap) fixed its price.  
He also said that it might take a few months to deliver the vaccine. 
Meanwhile, according to the data released by the National Command and Operation Centre here, 1,800 new cases and 58 deaths were reported due to Covid-19 on Tuesday in the country. 
The total number of people died across the country because of the deadly pandemic has now reached 11,055.",Pakistan
"Embattled Paine wants to lead Aussies to South Africa
","January 20, 2021","BRISBANE: Australian captain Tim Paine insists he is the right man to lead his team to South Africa and to the possible World Test Championship final at Lords despite a sub-par performance in the Test series against India. 
India beat Australia by three wickets at the Gabba on Tuesday, the first time since 1988 the Australians have lost a Test in Brisbane. The win ensured the tourists claimed the series 2-1 and retained the Border-Gavaskar Trophy they won in Australia in 2018-19. 
Paine conceded he was below par in the last two Tests. 
He dropped a number of chances on the final day in Sydney, when India batted all day to salvage a draw, and missed a stumping on the last day in Brisbane as Rishabh Pant led India to a stunning victory. 
Paine also came under heavy criticism from a number of former players over his bowling changes, field placings and his decisions on when to declare. 
But he said that he had no intention of stepping down and would take Australia to South Africa in February. 
“I’m still looking forward to going to South Africa to try and win a series there,” Paine said. “We had a goal to make the [World] Test Championship final — that’s still achievable and it’s a goal for me and the group.” 
India are now top of the Test championship table, with New Zealand second and Australia third. 
The series against South Africa is the last chance Australia have of reaching the top two and making the August final at Lord’s. 
Paine was also forced to fend off criticism from former Australian great Adam Gilchrist that he couldn’t captain effectively and keep wicket as well. 
“I think I had an ordinary day in Sydney, I’ll cop that on the chin,” Paine said. “It doesn’t always go your way in cricket or in life so for me it’s about soldiering on. 
“I said a few times I have improvement in me, I still feel like I want to get better and I certainly want to keep leading this team.” 
Paine was appointed captain and wicket-keeper after the ball tampering scandal in South Africa, which led to Steve Smith being stood down as captain and suspended for 12 months. 
“I’m loving the job. I’m going to cop heaps of flak I know that,” he said. “I’ve been absolutely belted by the Indians over the last seven days — that’s been interesting. But that’s par for the course for this job.”",Newspaper
"Govt responsible for enforced disappearances: IHC
","January 20, 2021","ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday observed that the prime minister and his cabinet were responsible for ‘enforced disappearances’ in the federal capital, and sought a list of prime ministers who held the office since 2015.
IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah while hearing a petition filed by Nasreen Begum, mother of Imran Khan, who has been missing since 2015, held that “the ultimate responsibility of law and order in the 1,400 square mile area of Islamabad Capital Territory is that of the Federal Cabinet.”
The court noted that “Prime Minister and members of the Federal Cabinet would become responsible for failure on part of the State to protect the constitutionally guaranteed rights of the citizens because the buck stops at the top. Enforced disappearance is the most heinous crime and intolerable in a society governed under the Constitution. The worst victims of an enforced disappearance are the loved ones of the citizen who goes missing. Their pain and agony is indeed unimaginable,” Justice Minallah remarked.
“Who should be held responsible when the alleged disappearance takes place from Islamabad? The buck stops at the top. Why the Federal Government i.e. the worthy Prime Minister and members of the Federal Cabinet may not be declared to be responsible for alleged enforced disappearances from the capital territory? Why in the instant case this Court should not declare every Prime Minister and member of the Cabinet responsible who have held the respective public offices from the date when the petitioner’s son went missing till his whereabouts have been traced or at least a satisfactory explanation is given for the latter’s absence,” he observed.
A Joint Investigation Team (JIT) after concluding investigations had formed an opinion that it was a case of ‘enforced disappearance’. 
The Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances is also treating the case as ‘enforced disappearance’.
Justice Minallah noted that the security, well-being and safety of a citizen is a constitutional obligation of the state.
Citing a Supreme Court’s judgment, the IHC chief justice stated that the apex court had held that the federal government means the prime minister and members of the federal cabinet. 
The alleged disappearance had taken place in 2015 and till date the state has failed in tracing the whereabouts of the petitioner’s son.
“As a corollary, the latter i.e. the prime minister and members of the federal cabinet would become responsible for failure on part of the state to protect the constitutionally guaranteed rights of the citizens.”
The court asked the attorney general to submit a list of prime ministers and members of the cabinet who held the offices from 2015 till the next date of hearing.
The attorney general is also expected to inform the court why exemplary costs may not be imposed on those who may be declared responsible for the failure of the state to give a satisfactory explanation for disappearance of the petitioner’s son.",Pakistan
"S&GAD orders regularisation of govt employees in Punjab
","January 20, 2021","MULTAN: The Services and General Administration Department, Punjab has directed the administrative departments to regularise the services of all in-service employees who were recruited under Rule 17-A of the Punjab Servants (Appointment and Condition of Service) Rules, 1974 from the date of their initial recruitment/date of induction into government service, Dawn has learnt.
According to a notification issued on Tuesday, Section Officer (Reg-III) S&GAD Dilawar Hussain stated that through a circular issued on Sept 29, 2019, the services of all the employees appointed in terms of Rule 17-A of the Punjab Servants (Appointment and Condition of Service) Rules, 1974 were allowed to be made regular from the date of their initial appointments.
“It was in the letter that in future all the appointments shall be made on a regular basis. Accordingly, it was construed that the said direction was to be implemented prospectively. However, that viewpoint was challenged in the Lahore High Court, Lahore. The honourable court viewed that the employees inducted on contract basis in terms of Rule 17-A ibid should be deemed regular employees with effect from the dates of their initial appointments,” reads the circular the copies of which were dispatched to the secretaries to governor and chief minister, senior member board of revenue, registrar LHC, all administrative secretaries of the province, the commissioners, the chairman Chief Minister’s Inspection Team and heads of all attached departments in the province.
It stated while keeping in view the orders passed by the LHC on Oct 15, 2020, the regulations wing of the S&GAD initiated a summary for the chief minister on Oct 21 with the view that a circular letter be issued with the direction to the departments to regularise the services of contract employees recruited under Rule 17-A of the Punjab Servants (Appointment and Condition of Service) Rules, 1974 from the date of their initial appointment/induction into government service.
“However, on the direction of Chief Minister, Punjab the matter was placed before the provincial cabinet which in its 39thmeeting held on Dec 17, 2020, considered the issue and decided that the cabinet considered and approved the regularization of contract employees recruited under Rule 17-A of the Punjab Servants (Appointment and Condition of Service) Rules, 1974 from the date their appointment/induction into government service, as per judgment of LHC subject to recovery of 30 per cent social security benefit according to the mechanism framed finance department,” the letter added.
He stated that all the administrative departments were requested to regularise the services of in-service contract employees.
Rule 17-A states ‘notwithstanding anything contained in any rule to the contrary, whenever a Civil Servant dies while in service any one of his unemployed children may he employed by the Appointing Authority against a post to he filled under rules 6 and 17 for which he possesses the prescribed qualifications and experience and such child may be given 10 additional marks in the aggregate by the Public Service Commission or by the appropriate Selection Board or Committee, provided he otherwise qualifies in the test, examination and/or interview’.

"Let down by UAE firm, Pakistan seeks two LNG cargoes
","January 20, 2021","ISLAMABAD: The government has sought urgent tenders for liquefied natural gas (LNG) deliveries in third and fourth week of February to fill the gap arising out of a default by Emirates National Oil Company (ENOC) on its supply commitment.
A senior official at the Ministry of Energy (Petroleum Division) confirmed that two cargoes had been sought from the international market using emergency provisions of the procurement rules. He said Pakistan LNG Limited (PLL) — the state-run entity responsible for import of LNG — had approached prospective suppliers for LNG delivery on Feb 15-16 and Feb 23-24.
In such circumstances, normal tendering schedules become impractical and, therefore, bidders have been asked to submit their bids within three days i.e. latest by Jan 22.
On Sunday, PLL confirmed that the UAE firm ENOC had defaulted on its bid.
PLL had advertised a tender on Nov 28, 2020 for procurement of two spot LNG cargoes for delivery in February. On Dec 28, bids were opened and results announced and, in accordance with the PPRA Rules, the award intimation was made 10 days later, on Jan 7.
The first spot cargo for mid-February was awarded to SOCAR Trading UK Ltd — an entity of Azerbaijan. The second spot cargo for the last week of February was awarded to the lowest bidder, as per the PPRA Rules, which expressed inability to deliver as per its bid, PLL said, adding that it had approached the 2nd and 3rd lowest bidders within the bid validity period, but they regretted to deliver the cargo at the prices they had offered in their respective bids.
Sources claimed that SOCAR was also finding it difficult to honour its bid and, therefore, the second tender was sought for delivery on Feb 15-16 to replace the SOCAR cargo.
Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Petroleum Nadeem Babar and Petroleum Secretary Asad Hayauddin did not respond to calls for comment.
“This bid default of the suppliers is associated with the recent supply shortages leading to high price volatility in the spot market, coupled with extra buying in North Asia,” PLL said, adding that numerous global companies were reportedly defaulting on their bids and even contracts in some cases, given the supply shortages and extremely volatile prices.
PLL said in a statement on Sunday that “suppliers who have regretted to supply after bidding in the PLL tender include state-run entities and major international LNG traders”. The company said it was taking all measures available under law and PLL’s tender process, including forfeiture of bid bonds, against the bidder(s) who failed to supply cargo as per their bids.
Since February is a low demand month, Pakistan has been importing 7.75 cargoes on average in February for the last four years. At this time, a total of eight cargoes are secured.
PLL said that it was working with the respective users to reconfirm demand at the current prices and was exploring alternatives if demand for an additional cargo in February was reconfirmed.
SOCAR had offered the bid at 23.4331 per cent of Brent for Feb 15-16 window. ENOC had quoted 20.948pc of Brent for Feb 23-24 window, but later walked away.",Newspaper
"Thai woman gets 43-year sentence for insulting king
","January 20, 2021","BANGKOK: A court in Thailand on Tuesday sentenced a former civil servant to a record prison term of 43 years and six months for breaching the country’s strict law on insulting or defaming the monarchy, lawyers said.
The Bangkok Criminal Court found the woman guilty on 29 counts of violating the country’s lese majeste law for posting audio clips to Facebook and YouTube with comments deemed critical of the monarchy, the group Thai Lawyers for Human Rights said.
The sentence, which comes amid an ongoing protest movement that has seen unprecedented public criticism of the monarchy, was swiftly condemned by rights groups.
Today’s court verdict is shocking and sends a spine-chilling signal that not only criticisms of the monarchy wont be tolerated, but they will also be severely punished, said Sunai Phasuk, a senior researcher for the group Human Rights Watch.
Violating Thailand’s lese majeste law known widely as Article 112 is punishable by three to 15 years imprisonment per count. The law is controversial not only because it has been used to punish things as simple as liking a post on Facebook but also because anyone not just royals or authorities can lodge a complaint that can tie the person accused up in legal proceedings for years.
During Thailand’s last 15 years of political unrest, the law has frequently been as a political weapon as well as in personal vendettas. Actual public criticism of the monarchy, however, had until recently been extremely rare.
That changed during the past year, when young protesters calling for democratic reforms also issued calls for the reform of the monarchy, which has long been regarded as an almost sacred institution by many Thais. The protesters have said the institution is unaccountable and holds too much power in what is supposed to be a democratic constitutional monarchy.",Newspaper
"Importers bound to e-pay over Rs1m duty, taxes
","January 20, 2021","LAHORE: In compliance with FATF requirements and as a measure towards digitsation and automation of economy, the federal government has made it mandatory on all importers to make payment of duties and taxes exceeding Rs1 million through the e-payment system.
From Wednesday (Jan 20), all duties and taxes over Rs1m will be paid only through the system of e-payment — internet/mobile banking, ATMs, over-the-counter (OTC) or any other electronic method approved by the State Bank of Pakistan.
It has been done since it was one of the requirements of the Financial Action Task Force, revealed Lahore Customs (Appraisals) Collector Mohsin Rafique while speaking at a seminar organised by the All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (Aptma) on Tuesday.
The taxpayers’ confidence and interest in e-payment continue growing fast and it can be gauged from the fact that the proportion of e-payments of income tax, sales tax and Federal Excise Duty increased from 6.26pc of total payments during July-December FY20 to over 40pc during the same period of FY21.
Similarly, the proportion of amount deposited in these e-payments has jumped from 13.55pc of total payments to 76.5pc during the comparative period of the current year, he added.
The facility for payment of all FBR taxes as well as some provincial taxes has been introduced for convenient and hassle-free payment. The traders can electronically pay all import duties and taxes through Customs computerised system WeBOC at ports and border stations across the country.
Moreover, the taxpayers can also electronically pay income tax, sales tax and Federal Excise Duty from their homes. E-payment system provides a round-the-clock facility to taxpayers and traders to make online payment of customs duties and other FBR taxes as well as provincial cess and stamp duty.
The facility is available through internet and mobile banking by using more than 15,000 ATMs of bank branches across the country.
The facility greatly helped the traders and other taxpayers during the Covid-19 pandemic since all transactions can be completed without physical interaction. Currently 18.6pc of import duties and taxes are being collected by Pakistan Customs through the e-payment system, said Mr Rafique.",Newspaper
"Border trade ranking improves to 111th: FBR
","January 20, 2021","ISLAMABAD: Pakis­tan’s rank on the trading across border index jumped by 31 positions from 142nd to 111th due to considerably improved implementation of several measures, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) said on Tuesday.
The improvement is linked with the ongoing reforms that led to huge improvements in trading across the borders index. The announcement of the FBR did not mention the year in which the index was calculated.
An official announcement said the FBR made trading across borders easier by focusing three crucial areas: enhancing the integration of various agencies in the Web-Based One Customs (WeBOC) electronic system; reducing the number of documents required for import/export clearances; and enhancing capacities of Pakistan Customs officials for playing pro-active role in smoothly regulating border trade.
Climbing up the ladder in Trading Across Border Index has enabled Pakistan in jumping up 28 places – from 136th to 108th – in World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Index 2020 and securing a place among the top 10 countries that have done the most in the corresponding/past year to improve the ease of doing business in their countries.
This milestone has led Pakistan to be the sixth global reformer and first in South Asia that has brought ease in doing business for the national/international trade.
It is important to note that border facilitation is amongst the top priority areas as per the comprehensive policy laid down by the government. Concerted efforts by Pakistan Customs led to impressive performance in terms of compliance to the provisions of World Trade Organisation’s Trade Facilitation Agree­­ment; hence, complementing Pakistan’s rise in the border index.
Pakistan Customs has pursued implementation of effective customs controls so that compliant trade is thoroughly facilitated, while lesser/non-compliant trade is diverted to detailed scrutiny. This strategy worked well and has gone a long way in reducing the dwell time (at the borders/ports) for imports/exports in Pakistan by increasing the percentage of clearances through Green Channel, the FBR noted.
For instance, the time required for documentary compliance to effect exports has been reduced from 55 hours to 24 hours, and the time required for overall border compliance has also been reduced from 75 hours to 24 hours.",Newspaper
"Trump's exit: President leaves office with legacy of chaos
","January 20, 2021","Donald Trump will walk out of the White House and board Marine One for the last time as president Wednesday morning, leaving behind a legacy of chaos and tumult and a nation bitterly divided.
Four years after standing on stage at his own inauguration and painting a dire picture of “American carnage”, Trump departs the office 
, with millions more out of work and 400,000 dead from the coronavirus. Republicans under his watch lost the presidency and both chambers of Congress. He will be forever remembered for the final major act of his presidency: inciting an 
 at the Capitol that left five dead — including a Capitol Police officer — and horrified the nation.
Trump will be the first president in modern history to 
 as he continues to stew about his loss and privately maintains the election that President-elect Joe Biden fairly won was stolen from him. Republican officials in several critical states, members of his own administration and a wide swath of judges, including those appointed by Trump, have rejected those arguments.
Still, Trump has refused to participate in any of the symbolic passing-of-the-torch traditions surrounding the peaceful transition of power, including inviting the Bidens over for a get-to-know-you visit.
By the time Biden is sworn in, Trump will already have landed at his private Mar-a-Lago club in West Palm Beach, Florida, to face an uncertain future — but not before giving himself a grand military sendoff, complete with a red carpet, military band and 21-gun salute.
Guests have been invited, but it is unclear how many will attend. Even Vice President Mike Pence plans to skip the event, citing the logistical challenges of getting from the air base to the inauguration ceremonies. Washington has been transformed into a security fortress, with thousands of National Guard troops, fencing and checkpoints to try to stave off further violence.
Aides had urged Trump to spend his final days in office trying to salvage his legacy by highlighting his administration’s achievements — passing tax cuts, scaling back federal regulations, normalising relations in the Middle East. But Trump largely refused, taking a single trip to the Texas border and releasing a video in which he pledged to his supporters that ""the movement we started is only just beginning"".
Trump will retire to Florida with a small group of former White House aides as he charts a political future that looks very different now than just two weeks ago.
Before the Capitol riot, Trump had been expected to remain his party’s de facto leader, wielding enormous power as he served as a kingmaker and mulled a 2024 presidential run. But now he appears more powerless than ever — shunned by so many in his party, impeached twice, denied the Twitter bullhorn he had intended to use as his weapon and even facing the prospect that, if he is convicted in his Senate trial, he could be barred from seeking a second term.
For now, Trump remains angry and embarrassed, consumed with rage and grievance. He spent the week after the election sinking deeper and deeper into a world of conspiracy, and those who have spoken with him say he continues to believe he won in November. He continues to lash out at Republicans for perceived disloyalty and has threatened, both publicly and privately, to spend the coming years backing primary challenges against those he feel betrayed him.
Some expect him to eventually turn completely on the Republican Party, perhaps by flirting with a run as a third-party candidate as an act of revenge.
For all the chaos and drama and bending the world to his will, Trump ended his term as he began it: largely alone. The Republican Party he co-opted finally appeared to have had enough after Trump’s supporters violently stormed the Capitol, hunting for lawmakers who refused to go along with Trump’s unconstitutional efforts to overturn the results of a democratic election.
But although Washington may have had enough, Trump retains his grip on the Republican base, with the support of millions of loyal voters, along with allies still helming the Republican National Committee and many state party organisations.
The city he leaves will not miss him. Trump rarely left the confines of the White House, except to visit his own hotel. He and his wife never once ate dinner at any other local restaurant; never ventured out to shop in its stores or see the sites. When he did leave, it was almost always to one of his properties: his golf course in Virginia, his golf course in New Jersey, his private club and nearby golf course in Palm Beach, Florida.
The city overwhelmingly supported Biden, with 93 per cent of the vote. Trump received just 5.4pc of the vote — or fewer than 18,600 ballots — not enough to fill the Washington Capitals hockey arena.",World
"China to become world's largest IoT market in 2024: report
","January 20, 2021","China will surpass the United States to become the world's largest Internet of Things (IoT) market in 2024, according to an industrial report.
China's spending on IoT is expected to reach around $300 billion by 2024, with the compound annual growth rate to stand at 13 per cent in the next five years, data from global market research firm International Data Corporation (IDC) showed.
In 2024, the country's spending on IoT will account for 26.7pc of global spending in the sector, followed by the United States at 23.8pc and Western Europe at 23.4pc, IDC data showed.
Among the 20 industries covered in the IDC's report, manufacturing, government and consumer IoT spending will account for more than half of the total market spending by 2024.
Jonathan Leung, a senior market analyst with IDC China, said the country saw disruptions in the IoT market due to Covid-19 and reduced IoT spending across all industries in early 2020.
""As China continues along its road toward recovery, we expect the market to bounce back in the coming years as enterprises begin to grasp the vital role of IoT in epidemic prevention and control, as well as their capabilities in mitigating market disruptions,"" he said.",World
"Washington on lockdown and on edge as Biden set to take helm in few hours
","January 20, 2021","Joe Biden swears the oath of office at noon (Eastern Standard Time) on Wednesday to become the 46th president of the United States, taking the helm of a deeply divided nation and inheriting a confluence of crises arguably greater than any faced by his predecessors.
The very ceremony in which presidential power is transferred, a hallowed American democratic tradition, will serve as a jarring reminder of the challenges Biden faces: The inauguration unfolds at a US Capitol battered by an insurrectionist siege just two weeks ago, encircled by security forces evocative of those in a war zone, and devoid of crowds because of the threat of the coronavirus pandemic.
			
Law enforcement officials are contending not only with the potential for outside threats but also with rising concerns about an insider attack by troops with a duty to protect him.
There have been no specific threats made against Biden.
The nation’s capital is essentially on lockdown. More than 25,000 troops and police have been called to duty. Tanks and concrete barriers block the streets. The National Mall is closed. Fencing lines the perimetre of the US Capitol complex. Checkpoints sit at intersections. The US Secret Service, which is in charge of the event, says it is prepared.
Stay home, Americans were exhorted, to prevent further spread of a surging virus that has claimed 400,000 American lives. Biden will look out over a capital city dotted with empty storefronts that attest to the pandemic’s deep economic toll and where summer protests laid bare the nation’s renewed reckoning on racial justice.
He will not be applauded — or likely even acknowledged — by his predecessor.
Flouting tradition, Donald Trump planned to depart Washington on Wednesday morning ahead of the inauguration rather than accompany his successor to the Capitol. Trump, awaiting his second impeachment trial, stoked grievance among his supporters with the claim that Biden’s win was illegitimate.
Biden, in his third run for the presidency, staked his candidacy less on any distinctive political ideology than on galvanizing a broad coalition of voters around the notion that Trump posed an existential threat to American democracy. On his first day, Biden will take a series of executive actions — on the pandemic, climate, immigration and more — to undo the heart of Trump’s agenda. He takes office with the bonds of the republic strained and the nation reeling from challenges that rival those faced by former presidents Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt.
“Biden will face a series of urgent, burning crises like we have not seen before, and they all have to be solved at once. It is very hard to find a parallel in history,” said presidential historian Michael Beschloss. “I think we have been through a near-death experience as a democracy. Americans who will watch the new president be sworn in are now acutely aware of how fragile our democracy is and how much it needs to be protected.”
Biden will come to office with a well of empathy and resolve born by personal tragedy as well as a depth of experience forged from more than four decades in Washington. At age 78, he will be the oldest president inaugurated.
			
More history will be made at his side, as Kamala Harris becomes the first woman to become vice president. The former US senator from California is also the first Black person and first person of South Asian descent elected to the vice presidency and will become the highest-ranking woman ever to serve in government.
The two will be sworn in during an inauguration ceremony with few parallels in history.
			
The tense atmosphere in Washington evoked the 1861 inauguration of Lincoln, who was secretly transported to Washington to avoid assassins on the eve of the Civil War, or Roosevelt’s inaugural in 1945, when he opted for a small, secure ceremony at the White House in the waning months of World War II.
Despite security warnings, Biden declined to move the ceremony indoors and instead will address a small, socially distant crowd on the West Front of the Capitol. Some of the traditional trappings of the quadrennial ceremony will remain.
The day will begin with a reach across the aisle after four years of bitter partisan battles under Trump. Biden invited Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leaders of the Senate and House, to join him at a morning Mass, along with Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leaders.
Once at the Capitol, Biden will be administered the oath by Chief Justice John Roberts; Harris will be sworn in by Justice Sonia Sotomayor. The theme of Biden’s approximately 30-minute speech will be “America United”, and aides said it would be a call to set aside differences during a moment of national trial.
Biden will then oversee a “Pass in Review”, a military tradition that honours the peaceful transfer of power to a new commander in chief. Then, Biden, Harris and their spouses will be joined by a bipartisan trio of former presidents — Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama — to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Ceremony.
Later, Biden will join the end of a slimmed-down inaugural parade as he moves into the White House. Because of the pandemic, much of this year’s parade will be a virtual affair featuring performances from around the nation.
In the evening, in lieu of the traditional glitzy balls that welcome a new president to Washington, Biden will take part in a televised concert that also marks the return of A-list celebrities to the White House orbit after they largely eschewed Trump. Among those in the lineup: Bruce Springsteen, Justin Timberlake and Lin-Manuel Miranda. Lady Gaga will sing the national anthem at the Capitol earlier in the day.
Trump will be the first president in more than a century to skip the inauguration of his successor. He planned his own farewell celebration at nearby Joint Base Andrews before boarding Air Force One for the final time as president for the flight to his Florida estate.
Trump will nonetheless shadow Biden’s first days in office.
Trump’s second impeachment trial could start as early as this week. That could test the ability of the Senate, poised to come under Democratic control, to balance impeachment proceedings with confirmation hearings and votes on Biden’s cabinet choices.
Biden was eager to go big early, with an ambitious first 100 days that includes a push to speed up the distribution of Covid-19 vaccinations to anxious Americans and pass a $1.9 trillion virus relief package. On Day One, he’ll also send an immigration 
 to Capitol Hill that would create an eight-year path to citizenship for immigrants living in the country illegally.
He also planned a 10-day blitz of executive orders on matters that don’t require congressional approval — a mix of substantive and symbolic steps to unwind the Trump years. Among the planned steps: rescinding travel restrictions on people from several predominantly Muslim countries; rejoining the Paris climate accord; issuing a mask mandate for those on federal property; and ordering agencies to figure out how to reunite children separated from their families after crossing the border.
The difficulties he faces are immense, to be mentioned in the same breath as Roosevelt taking office during the Great Depression or Obama, under whom Biden served eight years as vice president, during the economic collapse. And the solution may be similar.
“There is now, as there was in 1933, a vital need for leadership,” said presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, “for every national resource to be brought to bear to get the virus under control, to help produce and distribute the vaccines, to get vaccines into the arms of the people, to spur the economy to recover and get people back to work and to school.”",World
"PM Imran congratulates newly sworn in US President Joe Biden
","January 20, 2021","Prime Minister Imran Khan on Wednesday night congratulated newly sworn in US President Joe Biden following his inauguration. 
""Look forward to working with @POTUS in building a stronger Pak-US partnership through trade and economic engagement, countering climate change, improving public health, combating corruption & promoting peace in region and beyond,"" the premier tweeted. 
			
Biden 
 on Wednesday, declaring that “democracy has prevailed”. He swore the oath of office to take the helm of a deeply divided nation and inheriting a confluence of crises arguably greater than any faced by his predecessors.
On Tuesday, the Biden administration's nominated defence chief Gen Lloyd J. Austin said the incoming government 
 in any peace process in Afghanistan and believes that “continuing to build relationships with Pakistan’s military will provide openings for the United States and Pakistan to cooperate on key issues”.
Gen Austin made these remarks during his confirmation hearing for the post of secretary of defence before the United States Senate Armed Services Committee.
“Pakistan is an essential partner in any peace process in Afghanistan,"" Austin, a former head of the US Central Command, told the committee. ""If confirmed, I will encourage a regional approach that garners support from neighbours like Pakistan, while also deterring regional actors, from serving as spoilers to the Afghanistan peace process.”
Asked if he has perceived any change in Pakistan’s cooperation with the US since the Trump administration’s decision in 2018 to withhold security assistance, Gen Austin said: “I understand Pakistan has taken constructive steps to meet US requests in support of the Afghanistan peace process. Pakistan has also taken steps against anti-Indian groups, such as Lashkar-i-Taiba and Jaish-i-Mohammad, although this progress is incomplete.”
The general, however, acknowledged that “many factors in addition to the security assistance suspension may impact Pakistan’s cooperation, including Afghanistan negotiations and the dangerous escalation following the Pulwama terrorist attack”.
“Pakistan is a sovereign country,” he said when asked what tools and options the US had to influence Pakistan.
“I will press Pakistan to prevent its territory from being used as a sanctuary for militants and violent extremist organisations. Continuing to build relationships with Pakistan’s military will provide openings for the United States and Pakistan to cooperate on key issues.”",Pakistan
"Maryam berates premier for ‘delaying tactics’ in funding case
","January 22, 2021","LAHORE: PML-N vice-president Maryam Nawaz says Imran Khan’s administration is a ‘government of the mafias, for the mafias, by the mafias,’ saying the more he stays in power, the more the people will suffer.
“(This is a) government of the mafias, for the mafias, by the mafias,” Ms Nawaz said in a series of tweets on Thursday, chiding Prime Minister Imran Khan for adopting delaying tactics in the PTI foreign funding case for the last seven years.
			
“For the last seven years you (Imran) have been resorting to different gambits like changing your lawyers, stopping the Election Commission from checking your party accounts and seeking in-camera proceedings in the foreign funding case. Now suddenly you changed your stance and sought for open hearing of this case. You need to wait for a little to see what more is going to open,” she said.
			
Ms Nawaz also criticised the PTI government for increase in petroleum and electricity prices, saying that the more this man (Imran) remained in office, the more the masses would suffer.
			
On the other hand, PML-N information secretary Marriyum Aurangzeb has challenged Imran Khan to fulfill his promise of making all records of the foreign funding case public.
“Imran was only fooling himself with a claim that he wanted open hearing of the PTI foreign funding case. The people of Pakistan will not buy such lies anymore,” she said.
The former information minister said she had already made the PTI petition filed in Islamabad High Court to expose what a certified pathological liar Imran was. The ECP was waiting for Imran’s application to hold the proceedings of the foreign funding case in front of cameras for all to see, she said.
“Imran should first end the ban on media coverage of the foreign funding case with immediate effect and make all details of the 23 secret accounts in this matter public for the entire nation to see. He should also withdraw his application to keep the proceedings of this secret and hidden from all public view,” she said, adding that investigation into foreign funding had also started in the US and lawyers were being hired for that already.
“Imran should tell the nation how much he is paying to his lawyers in the US for this foreign funding case. He should also reveal how he is paying them for it. Is he paying it from government funds or from the illegal money from this illegal foreign funding”, she said.",Pakistan
"In a first, investigation heads to be watched over by AIG
","January 22, 2021","LAHORE: The provincial police officer (PPO) has delegated his powers to the additional inspector general (AIG) of investigation wing to evaluate the performance of senior superintendents of police (SSPs) and SPs heading investigation at district and regional levels.  
In another related development, the department has also established for the first time a complainant engagement system, and monitoring units at district and regional levels to improve the standard of investigation.
Provincial Police Information Officer (PPIO) of Punjab police DIG Sohail confirmed the development. He told 
 the major emphasis was on improving the investigation wing of police through fielding trained investigation officers (IOs), provision of requisite resources and enhanced supervision.
According to official data, every year 500,000 first information reports (FIRs) are registered under local and special laws in the police stations of Punjab. In Lahore alone, nearly 100,000 cases are registered every year. Under the new system, SSPs and SPs of investigation wings would be answerable to the investigation AIG regarding the investigation into registered cases.
Dawn learned that several other initiatives are also in the pipeline that included revamping of the investigation wing of Lahore, capacity building of IOs, provision of sufficient human and material resources to all investigation units, induction of modern-day technology and, most importantly, arranging the surveillance of habitual offenders and creation of provincial heinous offences unit on the pattern of the Counter Terrorism Department.
Mr Sohail said the renewed focus on investigation would be an important component of the strategic initiatives and institutional reforms after an extensive diagnostic analysis of the problems impacting the criminal justice administration in the province. 
The Punjab police department is mandated with law enforcement of the province housing half of the country’s population.
“With the passage of time, the quantum of governance challenges has increased manifold thereby necessitating the need of delegating the powers of provincial officers, including the office of IGP to improve organisational efficiency,” he said.
The PPIO said the move is expected to bring about a quality change in facets of investigation ranging from crime scene processing, crime detection, victim support, prosecution and conviction thereby paving the path towards the ultimate goal of sustainable prevention of crime through accurate detection and commensurate convictions. 
The close supervision of the provincial investigation branch would also entail standardisation and uniformity in the working of investigation units, he said.
The planned development of the investigation wing as a specialised unit has been a feature of the Police Order 2002. 
“Globally, investigation wings are always given precedence over the watch & ward and other police units,” the PPIO said.
Unfortunately, he said, the previous governments continued investing in the watch & ward function of police at the cost of the investigation wing.",Pakistan
"SBP launches complaint resolution portal for housing customers
","January 22, 2021","KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan has launched a portal for complaint resolution to promote affordable housing in the country that would help the potential customers and also promote low-cost housing initiated by Prime Minister Imran Khan.
The SBP said that the prime minister presided over a meeting of the National Coordination Committee on Housing, Construction and Development (NCCHCD) in Islamabad on Thursday.
State Bank Governor Dr Reza Baqir presented key features of an online complaint resolution mechanism developed by the SBP to resolve complaints of potential customers under the government’s Markup Subsidy for Housing Scheme for affordable housing.
Mr Khan praised the development of a user-friendly and comprehensive complaint resolution mechanism to assist people who would like to borrow money under the scheme, said a statement issued by the SBP on Thursday.
The complaint resolution mechanism comprises an IT-based portal supported by a comprehensive network of State Bank and commercial bank staff to take care of problems faced by applicants of low-cost and affordable housing finance. The IT portal has been made live for registration of complaints.
The system will help resolve complaints within a predefined timeline with proper escalation mechanism.
The potential customers can already access existing systems and procedures of banks for resolution of their complaints.

"Peshawar varsity staff to get basic pay only next month
","January 22, 2021","PESHAWAR: The University of Peshawar, the oldest public sector varsity of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, informed its staff members on Thursday that they would be paid only basic pay portion of the salary for the current month due to financial constraints.
According to the university, it will not be able to pay employees house rent, ad hoc, PhD, entrainment, orderly and conveyance allowances, and perks other than basic pay for the month of Jan payable on Feb 1, 2021.
A notification issued by the register said, “As such, only basic pay plus personal pay will be disbursed for the month of January 2021.”
The development came in the midst of the growing financial crisis plaguing the public sector universities of the province.
Around three weeks ago, the Islamia College University had asked the provincial government for a bailout package to manage dire financial straits.
A senior UoP staff member told Dawn that the ballooning financial crisis had forced the varsity into curtailing the payment of full salary to staff members.
He said currently, the university faced a shortage of Rs700-800 million.
“Last year, the varsity deficit was around Rs300 million but it has nearly doubled, now,” he said, adding that the university’s pension liability stood at Rs1 billion.
He said the university struggled to pay pension, commutation and other dues to the former and current employees.
The senior employee said the current prolonged Covid-19 pandemic had also contributed to the financial crisis as the closure of universities had also delayed fee payment by students.
He said the university was in contact with both Higher Education Commission and provincial government for assistance.
“The University of Peshawar had asked the provincial government for a bailout package, which led to an allocation of Rs250 million. However, only Rs150 million was paid. The remaining amount has been subjected to a reforms package proposed by the higher education department,” he said.
Dr Fazli Nasir, president of the Peshawar University Teachers Association (Puta), told Dawn that the university had been facing financial crisis since 2013.
He said the university’s pension and pay liabilities had been rising exponentially due to the absorbing annual pension and pay raise to their staff.
Dr Nasir said the basic pay amounted to only 45 per cent of the salary and it would have devastating consequences for low-grade employees.
He also said the varsity’s failure to pay full salary to employees was ominous as next month, the institution could even halve the basic pay payment.
“If you do not have money to pay salary for the current month, then how you are supposed to provide the same next month or thereafter,” he said.
Dr Nasir said the university was not even in a position to increase student fee due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
He said the Puta would hold a meeting today (Friday) to discuss the issue and chalk out a strategy about it.
“The government has to own its universities,” he said, adding that the situation indicates the privatisation of education.
On Dec 31, the Islamia College University asked the higher education department for a bailout of Rs618 million.
The ICU vice-chancellor informed the HED secretary in a letter that the university was facing a shortfall of Rs120 million in recurring grant from the HEC for 2019-20 and the allocation of Rs398 million against Rs1,890 million for the current fiscal.
He added said the Covid-19 pandemic had also created a financial liability of Rs211 million during the current fiscal, while a deficit of Rs407 million accumulated due to pension and commutation liabilities causing a cumulative shortfall of Rs618 million for the current fiscal.
On Jan 7, the government had directed all public sector universities in the province to abolish pension for future employees to manage the growing financial crisis.
“To overcome the rising budget deficit, the public sector universities will delink pay scales from both basic pay scale scheme and pay scale based on defined contribution. Pension scheme having no pension liability for universities shall be implemented for all future recruitment,” the letter which was sent to vice chancellor of the all public sector universities said.

"Report sought on rickshaw, taxi ban along BRT route
","January 22, 2021","PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court on Thursday directed the transport secretary to produce a detailed report until Mar 3 about a ban on the plying of rickshaws and taxicabs along the Peshawar Bus Rapid Transit route.
A bench consisting of Chief Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan and Justice Mohammad Nasir Mahfooz directed transport secretary Zakir Hussain to address all important points in the report, including commuting option in case of the suspension of the BRT service.
It issued directions during a hearing into the petition of rickshaw driver Alamzaib against the ban on rickshaws and taxicabs along the BRT route.
The petitioner’s lawyer contended that the government through a notification on July 20 had restricted route permits for rickshaws and cabs and placed a ban on their plying along the BRT route.
He pointed out that the BRT route was spread over around 30km and covered all main areas of the provincial capital.
The lawyer contended that rickshaws or cabs were mostly utilised by patients, elderly people and students and therefore, ban on those modes of transport on main roads would inconvenience them all.
He added that the ban would also render thousands of rickshaw drivers jobless. The counsel said there were around 35,000 rickshaws registered here but the transport department wasn’t renewing their route permits.
Additional advocate general Syed Sikandar Hayat Shah informed the bench that three meetings had taken place between the transport department and representatives of Peshawar rickshaw and taxi drivers to resolve the issue.
He requested the bench to grant 14 more days for the amicable resolution of the issue.
On the court’s notice, the transport secretary also turned up and said the department intended to place a ban on the plying of rickshaws and cabs on the GT Road from Chamkani area to interior city, while they would be permitted in cantonment as well as on University Road up to Karkhano Bazaar.
He pointed out that the decision to ban those transport vehicles from Chamkani up to City area on the GT Road was taken to ease traffic congestion on that route.
The bench observed that the BRT buses had frequently been facing problems as sometimes, the buses developed technical faults and caught fire and sometimes the BRT staff members protest non-payment of salary.
The bench wondered if the BRT service gets suspended, then what alternate option will be available with passengers.
It asked the secretary that instead of taking decisions while sitting in offices, they (officials) should visit the relevant spots and observe the problems of people by themselves.
The secretary said banning those transport vehicles in certain areas was an administrative decision.
He added that the BRT buses had also begun plying on different feeder routes so as to minimise the problems of passengers.
The secretary said apart from the restricted route, those taxicabs and rickshaws were free to ply on other roads of the provincial capital.
The bench directed him to convene a meeting of the relevant officials and prepare a detailed report keeping in view all aspects of the issue.",Pakistan
"PML-N, PPP reject appointment of ex-SC judge to head Broadsheet inquiry
","January 22, 2021","The PML-N and PPP on Friday rejected the government's move to 
 retired Supreme Court judge Azmat Saeed Sheikh as head of the Broadsheet inquiry committee, citing his past affiliation with the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) as creating a ""conflict of interest"".
""Handing over investigations to those who should [themselves] be investigated is the murder of justice. [Prime Minister] Imran Khan, have the courage to tell the nation you need a NRO (National Reconciliation Ordinance),"" said PML-N spokesperson Marriyum Aurangzeb.
			 
The statement said the appointment of the retired judge was a ""big fraud"" and ""controversial"" since Justice Sheikh had served as deputy prosecutor general of NAB during the original signing of the Broadsheet agreement and was one of the negotiators in the deal along with being a senior legal officer at the time. 
The statement further said Justice Sheikh also served as a member of the 
 of the Shaukat Khanum Hospital, adding that this showed PM Imran's ""ill-intent"" behind handing over the Broadsheet inquiry to him. 
""How can the investigation conducted by the former deputy prosecutor general be transparent and fair?"" questioned the statement, adding that ""being a legal officer, he [Justice Sheikh] had fully understood the document of agreement with Broadsheet.""
			
She further alleged that as deputy prosecutor general, Sheikh had also been tasked with making cases against PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif during Pervez Musharraf's era. Therefore, she said, ""no one should be a judge in his own case or in the case of those with whom he has a relationship or conflict [of interest]."" 
""The nation wants accountability for those who loot and squander their earnings, sprinkling salt on the wounds is not a joke,"" said the statement.
Addressing a press conference later in the day, PML-N leader and former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi called upon Justice Sheikh not to become the chairman of the inquiry commission. 
He claimed that the retired judge was ""directly working for the people who signed"" the agreement with Broadsheet in year 2000 and that ""he is part of this agreement.""
Sheikh ""was working for the people who committed corruption of billions through this agreement"", the PML-N leader alleged. 
He said he did not have any hope from such a commission to unearth the facts about the scandal and tell the public ""who wasted away Rs1,000 crore of the nation"".
""It is Azmat Saeed's test today to not make himself controversial by becoming chairman of this commission,"" Abbasi said, calling upon the former judge not to become part of the corruption allegedly involved in the Broadsheet saga. 
The former premier also demanded that the commission's meetings be held in the public domain, saying the Commission of Inquiry law allowed the same. 
""We demand that an uncontroversial person with parliament's permission be made chairman of this commission and its proceedings be made public,"" he said.
Meanwhile, PPP Secretary General Nayyar Bukhari said that the appointment of the former judge had exposed the government's dishonesty, adding that the purpose of appointing Justice Sheikh was to cast all blame ""on the opposition and previous governments"".
He said the PPP was also concerned over the appointment due to the ex-judge's past affiliation with NAB and the Shaukat Khanum hospital. Investigation of the Broadsheet case under such circumstances is tantamount to ""throwing dust in the eyes of the people,"" he said in a statement.
""Broadsheet is a very important issue [so] we want a transparent investigation,"" he said.
Justice Sheikh was appointed as the head of the inquiry committee to probe the issue of UK-based asset recovery firm Broadsheet LLC. The federal cabinet in its meeting on Jan 19 had decided to form a new inquiry committee on the recommendation of an inter-ministerial committee that had earlier been constituted by the prime minister to look into the 
.
Responding to the PML-N and PPP's criticism, Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid defended the appointment of Justice Sheikh as head of the Broadsheet inquiry committee.
Speaking at a press conference in Karachi, he said Justice Sheikh was a big name of the legal fraternity. 
""Has Sheikh Azmat ever remained the prosecutor of NAB?"" the minister asked, advising the PML-N to ""first read"" before commenting on his appointment. 
""And if we shouldn't appoint Sheikh Azmat, should we appoint Justice Qayyum?"" he added.
He reiterated that the Broadsheet scandal was ""Panama 2"", referring to the Panamagate case which led to the disqualification of PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif. 
Rashid said Justice Sheikh ""had read Volume 10"" of the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) report in the Panama Papers case, telling the PML-N: ""This news is enough for you.""
Broadsheet LLC, a UK company that was registered in the Isle of Man in the Pervez Musharraf era, helped the then government and the newly established NAB track down foreign assets purchased by Pakistanis through alleged ill-gotten wealth.
Broadsheet claimed that it was established to enter into an Asset Recovery Agreement dated June 20, 2000, and did so with the then president of Pakistan, through the NAB chairman, for the purposes of recovering funds and other assets fraudulently taken from the state and other institutions, including through corrupt practices, and held outside of Pakistan.
Broadsheet maintains that it was created to be a company specialising in the recovery of assets and funds, and was therefore engaged to trace, locate and transfer such items back to the state.
After NAB terminated the contract in 2003, Broadsheet and another company involved as a third party filed for damages, saying Pakistan owed them money according to the terms agreed upon since the government was taking action to confiscate some of the assets they had identified, including the Avenfield property owned by the Sharif family.
The companies' claims against Pakistan were held valid by an arbitration court and later by a United Kingdom high court that gave an award of over $28 million 
 last year.",Pakistan
"Indian farmers to step up protests after rejecting offer to defer controversial new laws
","January 22, 2021","Indian farmers on Friday rejected an offer by the government to defer three farm reform laws for one-and-a-half years, warning they would step up protests as they seek a repeal of the laws and a guarantee on minimum crop prices.
Farm leaders said hundreds of thousands of farmers from neighbouring states including Haryana, Punjab and western Uttar Pradesh would drive tractors through New Delhi on January 26, the Republic Day national holiday when Prime Minister Narendra Modi will join a parade of military forces.
Although some former government officials have expressed concern that the protests could turn violent, the leaders said they would remain peaceful and urged the police to grant permission for the convoy to enter the capital.
The 11th round of talks between government officials led by agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar and 40 farm leaders earlier on Friday was inconclusive. Farmers stuck to their demands while the government urged them to consider its offer to hold discussions to address their concerns after deferring the laws.
“There is a sort of deadlock as the government repeated the offer of deferring the laws, which is not acceptable,” Darshan Pal, one of the farm leaders told reporters after the meeting.
Modi’s government has said that the laws introduced in 
 will unshackle farmers from the obligation of selling produce only at regulated wholesale markets. But the farmers say the bills are designed to benefit private buyers.
Tomar said the government was committed to the reforms.
“If [farm leaders] agree with our proposal, we can meet tomorrow,” he said.
Hundreds of thousands of farmers have been camping on the outskirts of the national capital for nearly

"Mainstream parties plan power shows in AJK on Feb 5
","January 31, 2021","ISLAMABAD: As the election year has begun in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), the opposition’s Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) and the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) have decided to stage their shows of power in the valley at two different venues on Feb 5 when Kashmir Solidarity Day will be observed. 
As the 10-party PDM has already finalised its plan to hold a public meeting in AJK capital Muzaffarabad, the PTI said on Saturday that Prime Minister Imran Khan would address a public gathering in Kotli the same day. 
Talking to 
, a PTI spokesman said the party’s secretary general Aamer Mehmood Kiani had been directed to visit Kotli on Sunday (today) to finalise arrangements for the public meeting for which the party had already given the task to the president of the PTI’s AJK chapter Barrister Sultan Mehmood Chaudhry. 
The barrister has been busy for the past few days in causing defections in the AJK chapters of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N). Some members of the two parties have already announced their decision to join the PTI ahead of the elections scheduled to be held later this year. 
An AJK minister said that Prime Minister Khan would first address a special and traditional session of the AJK Legislative Assembly in the morning on Feb 5 and then would fly to Kotli for the PTI’s public gathering there. However, there was no official confirmation from the PTI about the participation of the prime minister in the AJK Legislative Assembly session. 
The PDM had earlier announced its plan to hold a rally and a public meeting at Liaquat Bagh, Rawalpindi, on Feb 5 but later on the proposal of PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif the alliance decided to shift the venue to Muzaffarabad. The suggestion for shifting the venue had been given by Mr Sharif to PDM chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman during a telephone conversation last week. 
According to PML-N insiders, the earlier venue — Liaquat Bagh, Rawalpindi — had been selected as a part of the build-up for the PDM’s planned long march. Since dates for the long march had not been finalised yet, holding the Kashmir Day rally at Liaquat Bagh had lost its justification, they said. 
Secondly, they argued, since the local leadership had recently arranged a gathering in front of the Election Commission of Pakistan’s office in Islamabad, burdening it with arrangements for another show just two weeks down the lane was hardly justifiable. 
Talking to 
, senior vice-chairman of the PML-N and PDM secretary general Shahid Khaqan Abbasi said that the Muzaffarabad public meeting would be addressed by Maryam Nawaz and Maulana Fazlur Rehman. However, he said, PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had not yet confirmed his participation since he was busy in the wedding of his sister Bakhtawar Bhutto-Zardari. 
On the other hand, after winning elections in strategically-located Gilgit-Baltistan (GB), the PTI has already started preparations for the polls in AJK. In November last year, the party had announced that it had decided in principle to contest the AJK elections without forming electoral alliance with any political party. 
PTI chief organiser Saifullah Nyazee in a recent statement had termed the party’s victory in the rigging allegations-tainted elections in GB “historic” and said that the PTI had become a strong and popular political entity in AJK. 
A source in the PTI said that the party leadership was expecting to win elections in AJK as per the past tradition, saying that history showed that the party leading the federal government always won elections in the two regions with special status. He said that they expected that like general elections in Pakistan in 2018, several “electables” would join the PTI before the AJK polls.

"Requiem for cotton crop
","January 31, 2021","			
 
Overall, the country’s cotton production is estimated to decline during the present marketing year by almost a third to 5.7m bales from 8.3m bales last year and 60pc from 13.9m bales in 2014. The cotton arrivals from Punjab are reported to have dropped by 30.6pc and Sindh by 38.7pc. 
According to PCGA Chairman Jassu Mal, the phutti arrivals at the ginning factories are the lowest in more than three decades resulting in the closure of 800 factories out of a total of 1,200, loss of tens of thousands of jobs and reduced income for cotton-picker women.
There are multiple factors for the decline in the production of cotton, which provides livelihoods to 1.2m farmers who grow the white gold on around 8m acres mainly in Punjab and Sindh. A large part of the rural economy, and textile & clothing exports, which constitute nearly 60pc of the country’s total overseas shipments, are dependent on locally grown cotton. The massive fall in the cotton production, according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) data for the first half of the current fiscal year, has led the textile industry to import 331,560 tonnes of cotton worth $532.1m compared with the last year’s imports of 49,573 tonnes valuing at $86.9m.
 
Mohammad Saad Ziker, an Insight Research analyst, says the textile sector is on its way to recovery following the removal of the Covid-19 restrictions. “We are witnessing a sharp surge in our textile & clothing exports for the last six months with the December shipments reported at $1.4bn, the highest-ever in a given month. But the growth is being achieved through imports of cotton and man-made yarn. To facilitate imports the government also has removed 5pc regulatory duty on cotton.”
“Many factors have stacked up against cotton growers,” an executive of a multinational seed company told 
. “For instance, the cost of the cotton production has grown massively in the last 10 years. The market prices, on the other hand, have lagged behind during this period, eroding growers’ margins. The area under cotton crop has also decreased from 2.96m hectares in 2014 to 2.53m hectares in 2019. It shrank further by 12pc in 2020 from a year ago because of better and more stable returns in competing crops — maize, sugarcane and rice. Additionally, the use of poor quality seed and changing climate has also played a major role in the consistently poor performance of the crop.”
Mr Mal endorsed the executive, lamenting that India has successfully increased its cotton production to 35m bales from 11m bales in last 20 years by adopting new seed technology. Similarly, Brazil has boosted its output to 13m bales from 5m in three years. “The lack of investment in cotton seed research and an inability to adopt new technology owing to poor enforcement of intellectual property (IP) has brought us to a situation where we need to heavily import cotton to meet our industry’s requirements.”
The stakeholders agree that there is no quick fix to the nation’s cotton woes. “We need to develop a long-term strategy to boost our cotton production if we want to double our textile and clothing exports,” argues a textile mill owner without giving his name. “It will take at least 5-6 years before we can increase our cotton output to 20m bales as envisioned in the Aptma’s Vision 2010. 
The government can start by enhancing the capacity of its research institutions through immediate involvement of the private sector and creation of a robust regulatory regime, as well as building confidence of seed technology providers by laying out the clear policy on genetically modified (GM) seed technology,” he added.
The multinational seed company executive points out that Pakistan is fifth largest market in the world for the seed companies. “But the lack of an enabling environment is stopping international players from investing here. Though Pakistan has developed an overarching legal framework in place that, in theory, provides for protection to the GM seed companies, it is found wanting in institutional capacity and requisite enforcement of the laws.
“For example, the Plant Breeders Rights Act enacted in 2016 still awaits implementation in letter and spirit. Similarly, despite a well-documented policy to adopt biotech innovation in agriculture, much of the action on ground remains inconsistent with the government’s policy position. Therefore, a clearly defined and predictable regulatory regime, together with effective enforcement of existing laws will go a long way in restoring confidence of seed technology providers in exploring investment opportunities in Pakistan’s cotton seed market.”
The textile mill owner says Pakistan’s cotton woes go beyond low yields. “The cotton grown here is of average quality with short fibre length, which cannot be used for producing high-end textile products required for exports. We need to implement a programme for producing long staple cotton. Besides, we have long been raising the issue of high contamination of cotton as Pakistani ginned cotton carries 10pc trash. No focused attempt is made to improve the cotton picking, packaging and ginning to reduce the trash and moisture level in it.”

","January 31, 2021","SYDNEY: The Australian Open will be allowed to admit up to 30,000 fans a day, around 50% of the usual attendance, when the Grand Slam gets underway on Feb 8, Victoria state sports minister Martin Pakula said on Saturday.
The limit will be reduced to 25,000 over the last five days of the tournament when there are fewer matches, but Pakula said the announcement would ensure some of the biggest crowds for a sporting event since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic.
“It’ll mean that over the 14 days, we will have up to 390,000 people here at Melbourne Park and that’s about 50% of the average over the last three years,” he told reporters at the venue for the tournament.
“It will not be the same as the last few years but it will be the most significant international event with crowds that the world has seen in many, many months.” Pakula said the decision was a testament to the job the people of Victoria had done in containing the new coronavirus after enduring one of the longest and strictest lockdowns in the world.
It has been 24 days since Victoria reported a locally acquired Covid-19 infection, while Australia as a whole posted a 13th straight day without a community case on Saturday. The Australian government said the country remained on track to start its vaccine rollout from late February despite reports of supply problems in Europe.
More than 1,000 people, players and their entourages, were obliged to undergo 14 days of quarantine on their arrival in Australia ahead of the year’s first Grand Slam.
Most were allowed out of their rooms for up to five hours a day for training and gym work, but 72 players remained in strict lockdown after fellow passengers on their flights to Australia tested positive for the virus that causes Covid-19.
Despite gripes from some at the start of quarantine, tournament chief Craig Tiley said he was “particularly proud” of the “playing group”, most of whom will be out of quarantine by the end of Saturday.
Melbourne Park, site of the Australian Open, was busy on Saturday with all but 22 players out of hotel quarantine and preparing for the tune-up events which get under way on Sunday.
Two WTA tournaments kick off official proceedings on Sunday, and Australia’s world No. 1 Ash Barty has a first-round bye in one of them.

"JI demands fresh census, empowered LG system for Karachi
","January 31, 2021","KARACHI: The Jamaat-i-Islami on Saturday staged sit-ins across the city as part of its campaign for civic and municipal rights of Karachi, fresh population census in the metropolis and an empowered local government system in the urban centre of Sindh.
Party workers, including women and children, at some places staged sit-ins and vowed to continue their struggle till the achievement of the desired results.
The party claimed that it had staged sit-ins at more than 50 points in the city to urge the government to initiate a fresh population census, set up an autonomous city government, annul the job quota system and hold LG polls forthwith.
“The protest began at around 4pm and continued till late night,” said a JI spokesman in a statement. “All leaders from all districts and supporters took part in the sit-ins, which remained peaceful. Apart from the party workers, Karachiites turned up in high numbers at the sit-ins showing their trust in the JI’s manifesto and its struggle.”
The sit-ins were held in North Nazimabad, Liaquatabad, Jauhar Mor, Mauripur Road, Regal Chowk, Orangi Town, Saudabad, Landhi, etc.
Karachi JI chief Hafiz Naeemur Rahman addressed protesters at the Qayyumabad, Kalapul and Shahrah-i-Quaideen sit-ins.
He warned that the existing policies of the federal and provincial governments for the city would cause suffering to the masses and lead to a national disaster.
He also strongly condemned the cabinet decision to approve the controversial National Census 2017 under which the population of Karachi stood much lower than the factual one and demanded that the authorities review it.
“We strongly demand that the federal government order a fresh population census of Karachi, nullify the local government law in Sindh and set up an autonomous city government in the metropolis,” he said.
“Isn’t it an irony that a city that generates employment for the people of every district and town of the country is never owned by the rulers? Isn’t it a tragedy that this city that deserves to become the world’s centre is pleading for its due rights from its very own rulers?” he asked.
From dictator Ayub Khan to the present day this city had never been given its due rights and share, he said.
“But enough is enough. This city has always been deprived of its true leadership through rigging, violence and conspiracies. Now we are here to fight the case of this city,” he added.",Pakistan

"Seven more die in KP as coronavirus continues to infect students
","January 31, 2021","PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa recorded seven deaths and 274 new Covid-19 cases on Saturday as the screening at educational institutions shows the virus continues to infect teenage students, both boys and girls. 
A report compiled by the health department said that about 160 students had so far tested positive for coronavirus during random testing in schools since resumption of screening in educational institutions on January 18. 
According to the report, 31 students were diagnosed with Covid-19 on Saturday, mostly in Peshawar, Khyber, Malakand and Kohat districts. 
The National Command Operation Centre (NCOC) had directed the province to resume screening after reopening of schools for 9th and 10th classes. So far, 10,500 students of schools and seminaries have been screened. 
The province had stopped screening in educational institutions when schools and colleges were shut down in view of the second wave of coronavirus. However, those were again opened in January on the recommendation of NCOC which asked the province to carry out random screening in schools and present a weekly report regarding the positivity level. 
Officials said that the NCOC had announced resumption of primary, middle and university classes from February 1, on the basis of reports of screening in educational institutions. They said that almost all the active cases found in schools were teenage boys and girls who were asymptomatic despite being career of the virus. 
The students who tested positive in schools had been advised to stay in isolation in their homes as they were safe themselves because of their immunity level, but could act as transmitter of the virus and pose threat to the elderly or people with underlying health conditions in their homes and in the community. 
From October 18 to November 18, 2020, KP tested 115,846 students of whom 2,496 had turned out to be positive for the virus.

Of the newly-diagnosed 274 people, 121 tested positive in Peshawar where number of Covid-19 incidence swelled to 26,976. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has registered a total of 66,953 Covid-19 cases since the onset of the pandemic. 
The government report said that 266 more patients recovered from the ailment which took the total score of recovered patients from the virus to 62,198. The province presently has 1,897 active coronavirus cases. 
Officials said that screening would continue in educational institutions and the reports would be communicated to NCOC, which would then evaluate screening data from all the provinces and make decisions regarding continuity of on-campus educational activities or otherwise. 
However, all heads of the schools and colleges have been instructed by the provincial government to ensure that the students adhere to social distancing measures, wearing face mask and hand washing to stay safe from the virus.",Pakistan

"Japan woman hid mum’s frozen corpse for 10 years
","January 31, 2021","TOKYO: A Japanese woman who said she hid her mother’s corpse in a freezer in her apartment for a decade told police she feared eviction if the death was discovered, media reported on Saturday.
Police said that Yumi Yoshino, 48, was held “on suspicion of abandoning and hiding a female body” found on Wednesday in a freezer in a Tokyo apartment.
Yoshino said after finding her mother dead 10 years ago, she hid the body because she “didn’t want to move out” of the home they shared, local media reported, citing unnamed police sources.
The mother, thought to have been aged around 60 at the time of her death, was named on the lease of the apartment in a municipal housing complex,

Yoshino had been forced to leave the apartment in mid-January after missing rent payments, according to the reports, and a cleaner then discovered the body in a freezer hidden in a closet.

"EU backs off jab threat as WHO warns against ‘vaccine nationalism’
","January 31, 2021","BRUSSELS: The European Union on Friday backtracked on a threat to restrict exports of coronavirus shots to Northern Ireland in its growing row with Britain, as the WHO warned against “vaccine nationalism”.
Outbreaks are raging around the globe with Covid-19 deaths nearing 2.2 million, and while wealthy countries fight over limited vaccine supplies, there are fears the less privileged will not get access for a long time.
British-Swedish firm AstraZeneca has said it can only deliver a fraction of its vaccine doses promised to the EU and Britain because of production problems, but both sides are demanding their pledges are met.
The EU threatened to restrict vaccine exports to Northern Ireland by overriding part of the Brexit deal with Britain that allowed the free flow of goods over the Irish border, but backed down after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson voiced “grave concerns”.
The European Commission will “ensure that the Ireland/Northern Ireland Protocol is unaffected”, the EU commissioner said in a statement late on Friday.
That came after the EU released a redacted version of its contract with AstraZeneca, while announcing a mechanism that could allow it to deny the export of vaccines made on European soil.
The AstraZeneca vaccine on Friday became the third to get EU approval after Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, but it came under the shadow of the bitter diplomatic row.
“I expect the company (AstraZeneca) to deliver the 400 million doses as agreed,” tweeted European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, as she announced the authorisation. The supply issue is a huge blow to Europe’s already stumbling vaccine rollout.
The EU-Britain tussle has highlighted the impact of shortages on ambitious mass vaccination programmes, even on wealthy nations, and fears are growing that the developed world is hogging doses, leaving poorer nations behind.
World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned against “vaccine nationalism”, saying there was a “real danger that the very tools that could help to end the pandemic — vaccines — may exacerbate” global inequality.
Parts of Africa and Asia have only just started securing and rolling out vaccinations. The global scramble for shots comes as more troubling data emerges on new variants of the coronavirus, which is known to have infected more than 101 million people worldwide.
Variants first detected in Britain, Brazil and South Africa are believed to be more contagious.
Scientists are concerned that the South African variant may elude some vaccines, a potential stumbling block in the global effort to defeat Covid-19 through mass inoculation. New data on Thursday and Friday showed average effectiveness of 89 and 66 percent for shots from Novavax and Johnson & Johnson.
But while Novavax’s jab was highly effective against the British variant, both were less effective against the South African strain. Pfizer and Moderna have said their vaccines are effective against the variants.",Newspaper

"Foreign troops to stay in Afghanistan beyond May deadline: Nato officials
","January 31, 2021","International troops plan to stay in Afghanistan beyond the May deadline envisaged by the Taliban’s deal with the United States, four senior officials of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) said — a move that could escalate tensions with the Taliban demanding full withdrawal.
“There will be no full withdrawal by allies by April-end,” one of the officials told 
.
“Conditions have not been met,” he said, on condition of anonymity, because of the sensitivity of the matter. “And with the new US administration, there will be tweaks in the policy, the sense of hasty withdrawal which was prevalent will be addressed and we could see a much more calculated exit strategy.”
The administration of then-President Donald Trump 
 with the Taliban early last year, calling for the withdrawal of all foreign troops by May in return for the insurgents fulfilling certain security guarantees.
Trump hailed the accord — which did not include the Afghan government — as the end of two decades of war. He 
 to 2,500 by this month, the fewest since 2001.
Plans on what will happen after April are now being considered and likely to be a top issue at a key Nato meeting in February, the Nato sources said.
The Nato's positions are becoming increasingly important after the alliance was sidelined by Trump, diplomats and experts say.
 between the Afghan government and the Taliban began in September in Doha, but violence has remained high.
“No Nato ally wants to stay in Afghanistan longer than necessary, but we have been clear that our presence remains conditions-based,” said Nato spokeswoman Oana Lungescu. “Allies continue to assess the overall situation and to consult on the way forward.”
She said about 10,000 troops, including Americans, are in Afghanistan. Those levels are expected to stay roughly the same until after May, but the plan beyond that is not clear, the Nato source said.
Kabul and some foreign governments and agencies say the Taliban has failed to meet conditions due to escalated violence and a failure to cut ties with militant groups such as Al Qaeda, which the Taliban denies.
The administration of Joe Biden, who replaced Trump on Jan 20, has launched a review of his predecessor’s peace agreement.
A Pentagon spokesman said the Taliban have not met their commitments but Washington remained committed to the process and had not decided on future troop levels.
A State Department representative said Biden was committed to bringing a “responsible end to the ‘forever wars’ ... while also protecting Americans from terrorist and other threats.”
Afghanistan’s presidential palace did not respond to a request for comment.
The Taliban have become increasingly concerned in recent weeks about the possibility that Washington might change aspects of the agreement and keep troops in the country beyond May, two Taliban sources told 
.
“We conveyed our apprehensions, but they assured us of honouring and acting on the Doha accord. What’s going on, on the ground in Afghanistan, is showing something else. And that’s why we decided to send our delegations to take our allies into confidence,” said a Taliban leader in Doha.
A Taliban delegation this week visited Iran and Russia, and the leader said they were contacting China.
Although informal meetings have been taking place between negotiators in Doha, progress has stalled in recent weeks after an almost one-month break, according to negotiators and diplomats.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told 
 the insurgents remained committed to the peace process.
“No doubt that if the Doha deal is not implemented there will be consequences, and the blame will be upon that side which does not honour the deal,” he said. “Our expectations are also that Nato will think to end this war and avoid more excuses for prolonging the war in Afghanistan.”
Nato and Washington will have a challenge getting the Taliban to agree to an extension beyond May.
If the situation remains unclear, the Taliban may increase attacks, possibly once again on international forces, said Ashley Jackson, co-director of the Centre for the Study of Armed Groups at the British think tank ODI.
The lack of a resolution “gives voice to spoilers inside the Taliban who never believed the US would leave willingly, and who have pushed for a ratcheting up of attacks even after the US-Taliban deal was agreed,” she said.
A Feb 17-18 meeting of Nato defence ministers will be a chance for a newly empowered NATO to determine how the process would be shaped, said one source, a senior European diplomat.
“With the new administration coming in there will be a more cooperative result, Nato countries will have a say.”",World
"Modi says protesters who stormed Delhi fort caused 'insult' to the country
","January 31, 2021","India’s prime minister Narendra Modi said on Sunday that protesters who stormed New Delhi’s Red Fort had caused “insult” to the country, his first public comments on a months-long farmers’ agitation that turned violent last week.

"Exports cross $2bn mark for fourth consecutive month
","February 2, 2021","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s exports grew for the fifth consecutive month in January to $2.14 billion, up to eight per cent from $1.98bn in the corresponding month last year, data released by the Ministry of Commerce (MoC) on Monday showed.
Commerce Adviser Razak Dawood in a statement said that Pakistan’s exports had maintained growth and for the first time in eight years have crossed the $2 billion mark in four consecutive months.
According to provisional figures issued by the MoC, exports for Jul-Jan 2020-21 increased by 5.5pc to $14.245bn as compared to $13.507bn over the corresponding months of last year. “Our cumulative exports for seven months of FY21 are showing a rising trend,” the adviser said.
The increase in overall exports is mainly driven by double-digit growth in proceeds from textile and clothing sectors as well as engineering products, surgical instruments and value-added leather products.
Mr Dawood said that Pakistani exporters have achieved this feat despite difficulties created by the Covid-19 pandemic, regional export situation and contraction in major markets. “Exporters please go full speed ahead in exporting your products and in case of any hurdle, inform MoC”, the adviser said.
Exports in the new fiscal year started on a positive note, but witnessed a steep decline of 19pc in August before rebounding in September, October, and November.
To promote exports of textile and non-textile products, the government is providing cash subsidies besides slashing duty and taxes on import of raw materials.
According to a report by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), the spread of Covid-19 had impacted the flows of containers from the country to the lowest level of around 12,000 in April last year. Since then a gradual improvement was seen in container shipment from the country.
Export facilitation measures have led to an increase in the number of exports Goods Declarations (GDs) from 71,190 in July 2020 to 79,756 in Dec 2020, posting an increase of 11pc.
Under the initiative of “Make in Pakistan”, the Duty Drawback rates for at least eight sectors were revised upwards by the FBR. During the whole exercise, more than 434,000 claims were disposed of and approximately 7800 exporters have benefited from this Initiative.
To realise the objective of facilitation/promotion of exports, an automated system of filing the claim to the final sanctioning of Duty Drawback Claims for the payment of Duty Drawback Claims to the exporter were rolled out on October 1, 2020.
As a matter of fact, export Goods Declaration filed in Customs WeBOC system is being considered as the Duty Drawback Claim. The State Bank of Pakistan credits the system sanctioned payments in the accounts of exporters online directly.
In FY20, exports fell by 6.83pc or $1.57bn to $21.4bn, compared to $22.97bn the previous year. Data showed visible improvements in export orders from international buyers, mainly in the textile and clothing sectors since May.",Newspaper
"Furnace oil sales jump over power sector demand
","February 2, 2021","			
KARACHI: Pakistan’s total oil sales rose by 11 per cent to 11.258 million tonnes during the first seven months of FY21 owing to a massive jump in demand for furnace oil (FO), high-speed diesel (HSD) and petrol.
A jump of 37pc was recorded in FO sales to 1.916m tonnes during July-January period of 2020-21 followed by 12pc and 6pc in HSD and petrol, respectively, to 4.288m tonnes and 4.740m tonnes.
Syed Fawad Bashir of Topline Securities attributed rising furnace oil sales to burgeoning demand from the power sector due to gas shortage issues during winter and an overall pick-up in economic activity following improvement in the Covid-19 situation.
During January, the sales of FO, HSD and petrol stood at 291,000 tonnes, 544,000 tonnes and 637,000 tonnes, up by 34pc, 14pc and 4pc, respectively, when compared with January 2019.
Petrol sales have remained robust following rising sales of cars, LCVs and two/three wheelers during 1HFY20. According to figures of Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers Association (PAMA), car sales went up by 13.4pc followed by 134pc in jeeps, 32pc in LCVs (pick ups) and 19pc in two/three wheelers.
Another reason of rising petrol sales was switching over of car and CNG rickshaw owners towards petrol due to prolong shutdown of CNG pumps in Sindh and in upcountry under a gas loadshedding programme to provide uninterrupted gas to the household consumers.
In the last few months, the price of HSD and petrol continued to crawl up on account of rising crude oil prices but it did not affect sales of four-wheelers.
HSD and petrol now sell at Rs116.08 and Rs111.90 per litre, respectively, compared to Rs101.43 on Rs100.69 on November 16, 2020.
However, increase in HSD demand appears surprising keeping in view of declining heavy vehicle sales from July to December 2020. Truck and bus sales fell 3.2pc and 20.4pc, respectively.
Petrol sales may further improve in coming months following launch of various Chinese and Korean cars, SUVs, jeeps etc in the last two months and massive imports of vehicles by the new entrants in the first half of FY21.",Newspaper
"Misbah warns Pakistan against complacency ahead of second Test
","February 2, 2021","RAWALPINDI: Pakistan head coach Misbah-ul-Haq doesn’t want his team to get complacent ahead of this week’s second Test match against South Africa.
The home side fought back from a precarious 27-4 in their first innings at the National Stadium, Karachi to beat the Proteas by seven wickets and take a 1-0 lead the two-match series. The second Test starts at the Pindi Cricket Stadium in Rawalpindi on Thursday.
Leg-spinner Yasir Shah and 34-year-old left-arm spinner Nauman Ali, playing in his first Test, shared 14 wickets between them against a struggling South Africa batting line-up.
“It was a much-needed victory,” Misbah said during a virtual media conference. “The team came back from a difficult position, but we don’t want to be complacent. South Africa are a tough team and we know they will come back hard at us.”
Since taking over as head coach in 2019, Misbah has lost three away Test series against Australia, England and New Zealand but his Pakistan side have beaten less formidable teams like Sri Lanka and Bangladesh at home.
Misbah and bowling coach Waqar Younis were summoned by the Pakistan Cricket Board after the team lost a Test series 2-0 in New Zealand last month. Both coaches were given another chance, but their longer-term futures were tied to the outcome of the current home series against South Africa.
“My focus is on this series,” Misbah said. “We will put all our energies in this [Rawalpindi] Test match and see how we can win. Other things are uncontrollable and there is no point in thinking about it.”
Middle-order batsman Fawad Alam’s dream return to Test cricket played a key role in Pakistan putting up a formidable 378 in the first innings of the Karachi Test after South Africa were bowled out for 220 inside two sessions on the first day.
Left-handed Fawad, playing in only his eighth Test match in 11 years, made a gritty 109 and revived Pakistan after a top-order collapse with Faheem Ashraf and Azhar Ali also contributing useful half-centuries.
But the conditions in Rawalpindi will be much cooler than they were in Karachi and Misbah said the team may change its bowling line-up to include four fast bowlers and only one spinner.
The dry pitch in Karachi gave the two Pakistan spinners plenty of assistance, but Misbah was not sure if he could get a similar type of wicket and conditions in Rawalpindi.
If Pakistan opts for a fourth fast bowler, Haris Rauf is a possible option to make his Test debut in his hometown.
“Haris is bowling well with the old ball,” Misbah said. “If the need arises we will see him.”
The head coach also praised fast bowler Hasan Ali saying he bowled well throughout  the recently-concluded domestic season. “We have to give a bit of margin to a player who is  making a comeback after a long time. Hasan as a whole package gives [us] an  edge,” he said.
Left-arm pacer Shaheen Shah Afridi was not being overloaded, the head coach maintained. “The  physio, medical panel, trainer and bowling coach all are looking at him  [Shaheen] and seeing that the line is not crossed.”
Commenting on the axing of experienced all-rounder Mohammad  Hafeez for the T20 series against South Africa, Misbah said “we would miss him” but added there was an opportunity  for someone else.
“Chief selector Mohammad Wasim has clarified why he [Hafeez] is not in the [Twenty20] squad. I think they understand better  than us and we can’t do anything about it. As a coach we will miss him  but it’s an opportunity [in the team] for someone else,” Misbah stated. 
Also on Monday, the Pakistan team  attended a training session at the Pindi Cricket Stadium.
Meanwhile,  South African cricketer Rassie van der Dussen said he was glad to spend  some time in the middle during the series opener.
“It’s good to be out there and  knowing that all your preparation and execution of your plans was good.  It [Karachi Test] was my first match in the subcontinent and I’m happy with that,” the  batsman said during an online press talk.
Van der Dussen crafted a fighting half-century (64) in the second innings of the match in Karachi.
To a question about any specific bowler who troubled him in  the first Test, the top-order batsman said Pakistan had a very balanced bowling line-up.
“I  will not say there’s one bowler that necessarily stands out. I think  playing against a good bowling line-up, everybody’s going to challenge  someone. Their spinners bowled very well and the seamers used the reverse  swing which made it pretty tricky for us. So everybody poses their own  threat,” the 31-year-old said.
The difference between South African  and sub-continent wickets was the bounce, the South African batsman underlined.
“There is less bounce in the  subcontinent [tracks]. You know, the ball’s not bouncing over the stumps, so  you’ve to set yourself up to sort the counter. So I think that’s the  major difference,” he said.
Van der Dussen said coming to a new country was a  great experience. “Conditions, practice, facilities, everything’s  different. I’ve just enjoyed seeing new stadiums, new practice  facilities and new conditions.”
Speaking about his skipper  Quinton de Kock, van der Dussen said he was consistent in character and a  brilliant cricket brain.
“If you look at the previous bowling efforts, I  mean, 80 per cent of our bowling effort in the first innings was  actually brilliant. The plans we had were good,” the South African player recalled.",Newspaper

Accompanied by Shazia Marri, the party’s secretary information, he said: “Those who claimed transparency are bribing their MNAs who have been paid Rs500 million each in the name of development funds. But let me make it very clear, these tactics won’t work. Some 25 PTI MNAs are in contact with the PPP as they are against the party’s failed policies.”
He said the PPP was against horse-trading and there were clear directives from party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari that no such attempt would be made in the upcoming Senate elections.
“But, I am confident that if PPP continues with its fair and democratic narrative, these 25 PTI MNAs would be with us in the Senate elections,” claimed Mr Kundi.
Ms Marri while condemning the recent increase in petroleum products’ prices called it a “brutal move” of the PTI government, saying the fresh increase would make lives of a common man more miserable.
“The PTI government has squeezed the blood of the people,” she said. “It seems that the petrol prices are being increased to give Rs500m to government MNAs. The incompetent prime minister is wasting nation’s money on unelected assistants. The people will soon come out on the streets against the heartless government.”
She called the PM a “pseudo philosopher” who pretended to know everything but actually was unaware of every ground reality.
“From power sector to unconventional economic sector, every segment of business is on the verge of collapse,” said Ms Marri. “His [PM Imran Khan] knowledge about power sector is defective as the power loadshedding still goes on in several parts of the country even in this winter season. To add fuel to the fire, there is a regular increase in power tariff since this incapable government has been imposed on Pakistan.”
She alleged that the PTI government, which promised to bring back $200 billion of looted wealth to the country, factually lost $11bn in loan in the last 30 months.
“The debt is increasing with such a fast pace that it was never experienced before. The value of rupee to dollar has decreased due to the failed economic policies of the prime minister,” she said.",Pakistan
"Drive to remove ‘soft’ encroachments along Gujjar nullah to begin tomorrow
","February 2, 2021","KARACHI: Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Monday directed the Karachi administration to start an anti-encroachment drive along the Gujjar nullah from Wednesday and also issued directives for construction of a water channel from Saadi Town to Lat dam for saving the area from urban flooding.
“I want to construct another dam upstream of Lat dam so that waste/rainwater could be stored there for agricultural purposes apart from recharging the groundwater aquifers of Malir district,” he said.
He took these decisions while presiding over the meeting of the Provincial Coordi­nation and Implementation Committee (PCIC) here at CM House.
The meeting was attended by relevant cabinet members, the corps commander, NED University Vice Chancellor and other officials.
Karachi Commissioner Naveed Shaikh while briefing the meeting said that 3,957 structures along the Gujjar nullah had been identified for removal.
The meeting decided that 12.6 kilometres on both the sides of the nullah would be cleared so that a road on both sides of the channel could be constructed for vehicular traffic.
The chief minister directed the commissioner and Karachi Administrator Laeeq Ahmed to start removing soft encroachment from Feb 3 to 13 and then from Feb 14 launch a full-scale drive.
“We have to clear the encroachments and have to save the city from urban flooding,” he said.
The CM also directed the commissioner to provide cheques to all the 3,957 people to be affected in the removal of encroachments.
It may be noted that an amount of Rs15,000 per household for six months is being given to the affected people.
The meeting was told that 235 units/structures had been removed from Jan 4 to date at Mehmoodabad nullah.
The chief minister was told that out of 65 compensation cheques 45 had been distributed among the affected people and 20 cheques would be distributed shortly because the affectees were out of the city.
LG Minister Nasir Shah told the meeting that in order to make solid waste management more efficient the draft Sindh Solid Waste Act had been prepared and sent to the law department for vetting.
The proposed act includes establishment of separate boards at the level of each divisional headquarter.
There would be six boards across the province and each board would work as independent and autonomous body within its jurisdiction.
The boards would be headed by their respective managing directors.
Divisional commissioners will be the chairman of the board and mayors/chairman of metropolitan/municipal corporations concerned will be on the board. There would be some technical members and private members.
The meeting decided to develop a separate storm-water drain from Saadi Town to Lat dam so that the area could be saved from flooding during downpour.
The chief minister asked NED University to study the project and submit its report.
The meeting was told that the Lat dam was a recharge dam constructed in 2011-14. It has a capacity of 53-acre feet. The reservoir was silted within two years after its construction.
The chief minister directed the LG department to remove sediment from the dam so that rainwater could be stored in the dam.
He also directed the LG and irrigation departments to prepare a feasibility report of another dam upstream of Lat dam.
He also decided to store waste /rainwater into Thadho dam to use it for agricultural purposes.
He added that presently waste/rainwater was flowing into the sea but it could be stored in Thadho dam to use for agriculture purpose.",Pakistan
"PHC upholds trial of political activist under Army Act
","February 2, 2021","PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court has upheld the trial of political activist Mohammad Idrees Khattak by a field general court martial (FGCM) for allegedly providing ‘official secrets’ regarding military operations in Pakistan to an official of the UK’s Secret Intelligence Service commonly known as MI6.
A bench consisting of Chief Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan and Justice Syed Arshad Ali dismissed a petition filed on behalf of Idrees Khattak by his brother, Owais Khattak, against his trial by the FGCM under the Pakistan Army Act.
Contending that being a civilian, Idrees Khattak was not covered by that law, the petitioner had requested the court to declare the trial illegal, without jurisdiction and based on mala fide.
Idrees Khattak, who is also a human rights defender, was taken into custody on Nov 13, 2019, near Swabi and was kept incommunicado for many months. 
Later, the defence ministry revealed that Idrees Khattak was in the custody of military authorities under section 2(1)(d) of Pakistan Army Act, 1952, read with Section 3 of Official Secrets Act, 1923.
Initially, the petitioner had filed a habeas corpus plea against the alleged illegal detention of his brother, a former general secretary of National Party, and when the information about his trial by a FGCM became public, the instant petition was filed.
In Oct last year, a high court bench headed by the then high court chief justice, Waqar Ahmad Seth, had stayed the trial and issued notices to the respondents, including defence ministry, seeking their response on the petition.
In its detailed judgment on the petition, the bench has reproduced the charges under which the detainee has been tried by the FGCM. He has been tried on eight charges falling under the Official Secrets Act.
In all eight charges, he has been accused of communicating with an official of MI6, Michael Semple, on different dates in 2009 and providing him with different information regarding military operations in different areas of Pakistan, including Bajaur, Swat and South Waziristan.
A panel of lawyers, including Supreme Court Bar Association president Abdul Lateef Afridi, Sajeed Afridi and Tariq Afghan, appeared for the petitioner and contended that the detainee was a civilian and neither he had committed any offence in connivance with a member of the armed forces nor was he subject to the Army Act and therefore, his trial by FGCM was illegal.
The counsel insisted that allegations against the detainee did not amount to the disclosure of official secrets.
They argued that the entire prosecution of the detainee was based on mala fide as MI6 official Michael Semple, who was the son-in-law of a retired general of Pakistani Army, had not been associated with the case despite being present in the country.
Deputy attorney general Aamir Javed contended that the FGCM had the exclusive jurisdiction under the Army Act to try not only military personnel but also all persons, who are subject to that Act.
The bench ruled: “In the present case, the arguments of the counsels of the petitioner that the allegations as narrated in the charge do not constitute any offence under the Officials Secret Act, 1923, cannot be appreciated at this stage for the reason that so far no evidence has been led by the prosecution. Thus, this argument, at this stage seems premature.”
The bench ruled that the detainee was charged for offences under the Official Secrets Act and under Section 2(1)(d)(ii) of the Army Act the detainee was subject to the latter law.
It added that reading Section 2(1)(d) in juxtaposition with Section 59(4) of the Army Act, these provisions had overriding effect over mechanism of the trial provided under the Official secrets Act and thus the FGCM was competent to try the detainee.
About the petitioner’s plea that the action of respondents was based on mala fide as the alleged agent of MI6 had not been prosecuted, the bench ruled: “Though these arguments have some weight in view of the law laid down by the Apex Court in the case of ‘Ghulam Abbas Niazai’ however, since the prosecution is at initial stage and there is no conclusive evidence before us that the detainee was intentionally singled out for prosecution and despite the availability the availability of Michael Semple in Pakistan, he was not tried for the said offence.”
“Let the trial be completed, and then this question can well be raised by the detainee before the appropriate forum established on the record,” the court ruled.
The bench has referred to different Supreme Court judgments, especially in the FB Ali case (PLD 1975 SC 506), in support of its decision.",Pakistan
"PM okays project to solarize tube wells in Balochistan
","February 2, 2021","ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Monday approved a mega project to solarize tube wells in Balo­chis­tan to provide uninterrupted electricity and overcome power sector losses.
The project was approved at a meeting chaired by the prime minister. The meeting was attended by Balochistan Chief Minister Jam Kamal Khan Alyani and federal and provincial ministers.
The solarization of tube wells would not only provide uninterrupted power supply to farmers, but also help overcome losses in power transmission.
The prime minister directed the Power Division and provincial government to present a comprehensive strategy to accomplish the project.
Moreover, he also called for defining the timelines for the execution of the plan.
The meeting was told that despite provision of subsidy worth billions of rupees for tube wells by the government, the farmers in the province still faced difficulties which also increased the circular debt. But the losses to the power sector were borne by the whole country, he added.
Therefore, the prime minister called for early resolution of the matter as judicious use of the subsidy was the government’s priority.
The prime minister lauded the government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) for providing health coverage to every resident of the province. Under the programme, 40 million citizens will get Rs1 million each as health coverage and they can get medical treatment from any public and private hospital in the country.
In his tweet, the prime minister said: “Congratula­tions to KP government for making KP first province in Pakistan with Universal Health Coverage for all KP-domiciled citizens.”
According to the PM’s tweet, around 40,000,000 residents are covered with free health insurance and there is free treatment of up to Rs1,000,000 per family per year in over 400 government/private hospitals across Pakistan.
Chief of the Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa called on PM Khan in Islamabad on Monday.
Inter-Services Intelligence Director General Lt Gen Faiz Hamid was also present during the meeting.
Matters pertaining to internal and external security were discussed during the meeting, an official press release issued by the PM Office said.

"Erdogan hints at moves to draft new Turkish constitution
","February 2, 2021","ANKARA; President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday it may be time for Turkey to adopt a new constitution, feeding speculation that he could seek a way to extend his rule.
Erdogan, 66, has governed Turkey as prime minister or president since 2002, cementing his control over the nation of 83 million people and surviving a failed coup.
As prime minister, he pushed through changes to the constitution in 2017 that created an executive presidency and abolished the premiership.
He then won the 2018 presidential election, the first of two potential five-year terms.
Turkey is scheduled to hold parliamentary and presidential elections in 2023, meaning that his rule would have to end by 2028 if he were re-elected.
But after chairing a four-hour cabinet meeting, Erdogan raised the idea of writing a brand new constitution to replace one that Turkey has been using since 1982. It was drafted following a military coup.
“It is clear that the source of Turkey’s problems is that constitutions have always been written by putschists,” Erdogan said in nationally televised remarks.
“It may be time for Turkey to reopen the debate about a new constitution,” he said. “If we reach a common understanding with our (ruling coalition) partners, we may take action for a new constitution in the future.” Erdogan’s AK Party is allied in parliament with ultranationalist MHP.
Erdogan added the the drafting of Turkey’s new constitution “would have to be done in a transparent manner and the agreed upon text would have to be submitted to the will of the people”.
Erdogan has never lost an election, but his popularity has been waning since he unleashed a sweeping crackdown after a failed coup in 2016.
His jailing of political opponents and assault on civil liberties have been accompanied by economic problems that analysts blame on financial mismanagement.
The Turkish lira has fallen sharply since 2018, wiping out people’s savings and undermining his support among working class voters who form a part of Erdogan’s political base.
Soner Cagaptay, Turkey programme director at the Washington Institute, said Erdogan’s comments were his “first admission that he may not win Turkey’s next elections held under the new executive-style presidential system.” “His likely next step: divide his opposition through culture wars along left-right lines,” Cagaptay said in a tweet.
“Turkey is a right-wing dominated country (where Erdogan will) try to build a new majority.”",Newspaper

","February 2, 2021","Four TikTokers, including one female, were shot dead near Anklesaria Hospital in Karachi's Garden area early on Tuesday morning, officials said. 
City Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Sarfaraz Nawaz Shaikh said all four deceased were active on social media, particularly Tik Tok. He said two of those who died, identified as Muskan and Amir, were friends.
According to the official, Muskan called Amir, asking him to meet on Monday night. Amir arranged a car and took his friends, Rehan and Sajjad, to meet her. 
""All four of them roamed the city and [Amir and Muskan] also made TikTok videos [during that time],"" the police officer said.

"NAB, Nepra to keep an eye on IPPs: minister
","February 11, 2021","• Says talks with banks under way to double their debt repayment tenure with IPPs

• Four Discos to be given to private sector to curtail losses    
ISLAMABAD: The government on Wednesday said the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) or Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) would be free to proceed against independent power producers (IPPs) for any misdeed or criminality even after they agreed to give about Rs770 billion discount over the remaining 20-year life of their contracts.
At the same time, the government is holding talks with banks to prolong their debt repayment tenure from existing 10 years to 20 years along with cut in interest rates.
“The government has not cut its hands at all. We have protected our every right (in the revised agreement with IPPs). There is no protection to any criminal act,” said Energy Minister Omar Ayub Khan while talking to journalists along with minister for information Senator Shibli Faraz and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Power Tabish Gauhar.
In fact the government had succeeded in convincing the IPPs to vacate stay orders from courts against heat rate tests ordered by the power regulator, the energy minister said, adding that they would share efficiency gains with the government on account of heat rates. The accountability and regulatory institutions would be free to take action if they find any irregularity or wrongdoing and a dispute could be settled in courts, he said.
Mr Omar said the earlier reported Rs836bn savings in revised agreements with IPPs were based on Rs168 per dollar exchange rate that dropped to Rs770bn after rupee appreciated to Rs160 per dollar. Of the savings, he said 50pc discount was on account of capacity payments and 50pc on energy cost.
About talks with banks, Mr Gauhar said banks were being asked to extend their debt repayment tenure to 20 years and interest rate from Kibor plus 4.5pc to 3pc or so. He said the National Bank of Pakistan and Habib Bank had been engaged by the government on the subject.
Also, he said the Sindh government was being asked to shift dollar indexation on Thar-based power plants to rupee as all the local IPPs had been delinked form dollar-based equity indexations to rupee-based equity.
Mr Omar said besides the Rs770bn savings secured from IPPs, the government also achieved Rs2.053trillion saving on about 8,000MW of public-sector power plants including nuclear plants, Wapda hydropower and thermal generation companies through reduction in return on equity.
Giving a breakdown of savings, he said a discount of Rs31.6bn had been secured from Hubco, Rs18bn from Kapco, Rs64.82bn from IPPs under 1994 power policy, Rs182bn form 2002 power policy, Rs3bn from solar projects, Rs147bn from baggasse-based power plants, Rs19bn from wind power plants, Rs33bn on account of operation and maintenance cost, Rs53bn in excess profits and Rs158bn in other areas. Of the total Rs403bn agreed for payment, he said, Rs72bn would flow to fuel suppliers including Rs58bn to PSO with the result that Rs112bn would return to the public sector.
Mr Gauhar said Rs96bn saving had been secured over interest-over-interest and binding contracts had been secured from IPPs to utilise about Rs112bn in filling their fuel storages for all times. He said Rs38bn saving had been achieved only on account of discount on late payment surcharge on non-payment of dues for the first 60 days for which interest rate had been reduced from Kibor plus 4.5pc to 2.5pc even though interest after first 60 days would get back to Kibor plus 4.5pc.
 
He said the cost of transmission and distribution losses was about Rs150bn per annum. As 85pc of the losses were on account of Peshawar, Hyderabad, Quetta and Multan Discos, they would be given to the private sector under management contracts instead of outright privatisation or sale of shares.
Mr Gauhar said the payment plan with IPPs had been shared with the IMF and Rs1.95 per unit increase was being made in power rates to revive the IMF programme. He hoped the remaining Rs1.39 of the Rs3.34 per unit increase determined by the regulator would not be passed on to consumers amid the pandemic.",Newspaper

"Myanmar protesters back on streets despite police violence
","February 11, 2021","YANGON: Large crowds demonstrating against the military takeover in Myanmar again defied a ban on protests on Wednesday, even after security forces ratcheted up the use of force against them and raided the headquarters of the political party of ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
Witnesses estimated that tens of thousands of protesters, if not more, turned out in Yangon and Mandalay, the country’s biggest cities. Rallies also took place in the capital Naypyitaw and elsewhere.
The protesters are demanding that power be restored to Suu Kyis deposed civilian government. They’re also seeking freedom for her and other governing party members since the military detained them after blocking the new session of Parliament on Feb 1.
As part of Generation Z we are first-time voters. This is our first time to protest as well, said one student who declined to give her name for fear of harassment. They negated our votes and this is totally unfair. We do not want that. We hope they release our leaders and implement a real democracy.
The military says it acted because November’s election, which Suu Kyis National League for Democracy won in a landslide, were marred by irregularities. The election commission had refuted the allegation.
Some demonstrators in Yangon gathered at foreign embassies to seek international pressure against the coup.
A small group outside the Japanese Embassy held signs and chanted We want democracy, we get dictators! They sat in several children’s wading pools, three or fewer per pool, in what appeared to be a tongue-in-cheek way of showing compliance with an emergency law that bans gatherings of more than five people.
Others marched through the city, chanting and waving flags of Suu Kyis party.
Another group hauled a fake coffin as part of a mock funeral for Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the military chief who is the country’s new leader.
The burgeoning protests and the juntas latest raid suggest there is little room for reconciliation. The military, which ruled directly for five decades after a 1962 coup, used deadly force to quash a massive 1988 uprising and a 2007 revolt led by Buddhist monks.
In Naypyitaw and Mandalay on Tuesday, police sprayed water cannons and fired warning shots to try to clear away protesters. In Naypyitaw, they shot rubber bullets and apparently live rounds, wounding a woman protester, according to witnesses and footage on social media. The reports could not be independently confirmed.
Human Rights Watch cited a doctor at a Naypyitaw hospital as saying the woman was in critical condition. The doctor said the woman had a projectile lodged in her head, believed to be a bullet that had penetrated the back of the right ear, and had lost significant brain function. The doctor said a man had been also been treated with an upper body wound consistent with that of live ammunition.
State television network MRTV, in one of its few reports on the protests, on Tuesday night broadcast scenes it claimed showed the protesters were responsible for the violence.
Myanmar police should immediately end the use of excessive and lethal force the New York-based watchdog urged.
No major incidents were reported in connection with the big turnout at Wednesday’s protest in Mandalay. Social media users said 82 people who had been arrested were freed due to the work of local lawyers.
Medical students and personnel and Buddhist monks were among a huge cross-section of residents who marched in Mandalay, but the most social media buzz was generated by a contingent of shirtless muscled men with well-defined six-packs who were said to be members of a fitness gym.
The military on Tuesday night raided the national headquarters of Suu Kyis party, which before the military seized power had been slated to take power for a second five-year term.
Kyi Toe, a spokesman for the party, wrote on Facebook that the army broke into the headquarters in Yangon and another office and took away documents and computer hardware. The headquarters was shuttered on Wednesday.",Newspaper
"Saudi women’s rights activist walks free after three years
","February 11, 2021","RIYADH: Saudi authorities on Wednesday released prominent women’s rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul, her siblings said, after nearly three years in detention.
“Loujain is at home!!!!!!!” her sister Lina al-Hathloul wrote on Twitter.
			
Loujain was  “at home after 1001 days in prison,” she added along with a picture of the freed activist.
Hathloul, 31, was arrested in May 2018 with about a dozen other women activists just weeks before the historic lifting of a decades-long Saudi ban on female drivers, a reform they had long campaigned for, sparking a torrent of international criticism.
In late December, a Saudi court handed Hathloul a prison term of five years and eight months for terrorism-related crimes, but her family said a partially suspended sentence paved the way for her early release.
The verdict was a  “face-saving exit strategy” for the Saudi government after it came under severe international pressure for her release, the source close to Hathloul’s family said at the time.
Her release comes after US President Joe Biden pledged to intensify scrutiny of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s human rights record.
He is expected to push the kingdom to release dual US-Saudi citizens, activists and royal family members, many of whom are detained without any formal charges.
After being tried in Riyadh’s criminal court, Hathloul’s case was transferred last November to the Specialised Criminal Court, or the anti-terrorism court, which campaigners say is used to silence critical voices under the cover of fighting terrorism.",Newspaper

"Charismatic leadership appeals more to people, admits AGP
","February 11, 2021","ISLAMABAD: Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Khalid Jawed Khan on Wednesday admitted before the Supreme Court that charismatic leadership does appeal to the people than the manifesto of the political parties. 
The standing role of the political leader always plays an important role, AGP argued and to substantiate his point he cited the towering personality like that of the founding father Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, to whom the people followed. 
Headed by the chief justice, a five-judge bench is hearing a presidential reference through which President Dr Arif Alvi had sought an answer to a question, whether the condition of secret ballot under Article 226 of the Constitution applies to the Senate elections or not. 
AGP made the statement on a query raised by Chief Justice of Pakistan Gulzar Ahmed about the philosophy asking whether the people follow the manifesto of the political parties or the charisma of the leadership. 
Ideally the people should follow both the manifesto as well as the leaders, AGP said but agreed that the charismatic leader’s statements go straight to the heart of the people. 
Really it is the programme, AGP said, that should be followed adding that the mandate the political party was based on its manifesto but this was only possible if the members remained disciplined to the party lines. 
And if they don’t do it then the members breach the trust of the people who voted them to power, observed the chief justice. 
Justice Ijazul Ahsan also observed that the people could also ask the leaders how many promises they have fulfilled. 
During the hearing Justice Umar Ata Bandial observed that the elections to the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly were conducted under the National Assembly rules which were not constitutional. 
But AGP replied these elections were not conducted by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) rather by the outgoing speaker adding suppose there was no rule, still such elections would be held under the constitution. 
When the chief justice wondered whether the framers of the constitution who inserted Article 226 in the constitution were not familiar with the elections to the Senate, AGP replied that the legal luminaries like former Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Maulana Mufti Mehmood, Shah Ahmed Noorani, Wali Khan and many others were so much pure in their heart like the judges of the Supreme Court that they could not have envisioned a situation where bags full of money would be used to buy the loyalties of the members for the Senate elections. 
AGP also recalled how former President Gen Ziaul Haq after overthrowing the government of Zulfikar Bhutto formed a committee to find out corruption but the only corruption they could find out against Bhutto was less payment of import duties on air-conditioners for the 70-Clifton Karachi – the personal residence of Bhutto. But today it is altogether a different world. AGP said.",Pakistan
"High court serves contempt notices on education officials

A bench consisting of Chief Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan and Justice Syed Arshad Ali issued the order for the purpose over a petition of candidate Aneela Afridi, who insisted that the court had stopped the E&S education director and DEO from holding BTS test for filling three vacant posts but they conducted the test in Kohat on Jan 23.
It ordered the fixing of the petition for hearing on Mar 9 along with the main petition filed by Ms Aneela against the appointment of three candidates ‘without the required qualification’.
The bench ordered the director and DEO (female) to respond to the petition during the next hearing.
Malik Ihtishamul Haq, lawyer for the petitioner, said his client had challenged appointments against the CT-IT posts in Kohat.
He said the petitioner had also challenged a notification of the E&SE department issued on Apr 24, 2017, which provided that an appointed candidate shall acquire a required qualification within three years of his or her appointment.
The lawyer said the petitioner had requested the court to declare unconstitutional and discriminatory the impugned notification to the extent of acquiring qualification within three years.
He contended that on Jan 28, a high court bench had issued a stay order in favour of his client and directed the respondents not to re-advertise vacancies.
Mr Ihtesham said the respondents not only re-advertised the posts but also convened the NTS test on Jan 23 prompting him to file an application on behalf of his client for staying the same.
He said on Jan 21, a high court bench ordered the director and DEO to maintain status quo on the issue but in violation of that order, the latter went ahead with the NTS test on Jan 23.
The lawyer requested the bench to initiate contempt proceedings against the two respondents and punish them accordingly.
He said the Kohat DEO (female) had advertised some posts of CT-IT (BPS-12) in Kohat on May 19, 2019, and as his client had requisite qualifications, she had applied for them.
Mr Ihtesham claimed that after the process of screening and short-listing test, a first tentative merit list was displayed in which the petitioner was shown at Serial No 2.
He claimed that the DEO had appointed four candidates and three of them didn’t possess the required qualifications and therefore, they were illegally considered for the posts and theyr appointments were illegal.
The lawyer argued that all those candidates, who had acquired certificate and diploma of certified teacher, associate degree in education and diploma in information technology, would become redundant and of no use due to the impugned notification.",Pakistan
"Army to use infrared cameras in search mission for Ali Sadpara, two others
","February 11, 2021","Search efforts for mountaineers Muhammad Ali Sadpara, John Snorri and John Pablo Mohr are expected to resume on Thursday, after slight improvement in Skardu's weather.
A special forward looking infrared (FLIR) mission by a C-130 aircraft along with four high-altitude porters (HAPs) from Sadpara village will be used in the operation.
Bad weather in the area over the past four days thwarted attempts for an on-ground and aerial search for the three mountaineers who were last seen near the Bottleneck on K2 on February 5. 
""FLIR will be used for the search mission. High altitude climbers are also engaged for ground search as a result of any location spotted through FLIR mission. All efforts are geared up for search of national hero Ali Sadpara and his brave team including John Snorri of Iceland and JP Mohr,"" a statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations said. 
The sensors in FLIR cameras detect infrared radiation and convert it into an image.
Alpine Club of Pakistan (ACP) secretary Karrar Haideri said the four HAPs — Sadiq Sadpara, Ali Muhammad Sadpara, Ali Raza Sadpara and Dilawar Sadpara — will be part of the search mission and are in Skardu.
""Sadiq and Ali Muhammad, both of whom have experience of 8,000m peaks, are already acclimatised and go above the base camp if the need arises,"" he said. 
Ali, Snorri and Mohr lost contact with the base camp late on Friday and were reported missing on Saturday after their support team stopped receiving communications from them during their attempt to summit the world's second-highest mountain. A search operation was launched but has constantly been hampered due to extreme weather.
High altitude climbers Fazal Ali and Jalal from Shimshal, Imtiaz Hussain and Akbar Ali from Skardu, are already at the K2 basecamp.
Imtiaz and Akbar, who are relatives of the missing Sadpara, had arrived at the basecamp via helicopter a day after the climbers were reported missing. They ascended up the mountain to look for them but were asked to return to the base camp as the weather continued to worsen and concerns arose over their health as they had not been acclimatised yet.
Meanwhile, members of the mountaineering community and ACP have urged media and social media users to respect the privacy of the families of missing climbers, particularly the family of Ali Sadpara and avoid sharing fake or unverified reports.",Pakistan
"Mohammad Rizwan's 104-run knock propels Pakistan to victory in first T20I against S. Africa
","February 11, 2021","Mohammad Rizwan's splendid 104-run knock propelled Pakistan to victory in the first Twenty20 International against South Africa at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore on Thursday.
It was Rizwan's highest-ever score in a T20I match and helped Pakistan set a respectable target for the visitors after the hosts suffered a loss early on when captain Babar Azam was run out in the very first over. 
			
Earlier, South Africa won the toss and elected to field first against the hosts.
Pakistan suffered an early loss when their talisman Babar Azam was run out by Bjorn Fortuin on the second ball of the match for a duck.
The hosts struggled to find their footing, losing Haider Ali at the start of the sixth over when he was caught out by Jacques Snyman off Andile Phehlukwayo's ball. Haider was replaced by Hussain Talat at the pitch who tried to swiftly pick up runs, hitting two consecutive fours and scoring 15 runs off nine balls. 
He lost his wicket in the 10th over, leaving Pakistan struggling to build momentum. 
Mohammad Rizwan brought much-needed stability for the hosts, hitting three sixes in one over to complete his half-century, his second in T20Is. 
Pakistan lost their fourth wicket in the 13th over as South Africa continued their flawless fielding as Iftikhar Ahmed was caught out by Reeza Hendricks off Fortuin's ball. 
Khushdil Shah, who replaced Iftikhar, played it safe before hitting a huge six in the 17th over. 
He tried to hit another boundary on the next ball but was caught out by Fortuin instead. 
Faheem Ashraf was caught out by Miller on Phehlukwayo's ball in the 18th over. 
South Africa were off to a solid start, having managed to score 44 runs with zero loss of wickets at the end of five overs. 
Haris Rauf's over proved to be the most expensive for the hosts as the Proteas scored 18 runs off the six balls. 
Leg-spinner Usman Qadir took the first wicket for Pakistan as he bowled out Janneman Malan in the seventh over. 
He took Jacques Snyman's wicket too in the ninth over with a brilliantly bowled googly. Faheem Ashraf took the third wicket for Pakistan when David Miller was caught out by wicketkeeper Mohammad Rizwan. 
However, Faheem's luck ran out in the next over he bowled with South African batsmen hitting three consecutive boundaries. 
The Proteas lost their fourth wicket when captain Heinrich Klaasen was caught out by Hussain Talat on Rauf's ball. Reeza Hendricks was run out in the 18th over when he misjudged and ran out of his crease while Andile Phehlukwayo stayed out. 
The visitors lost their next wicket in the same over as Phehlukwayo was caught out. 
Pakistan entered the game after sweeping a two-match Test series 2-0 against the Proteas and look 
to be the favourites in the three-match T20 series.
In the lead-up to the ongoing home series against South Africa, the Pakistan team and its management faced a lot of criticism after disastrous off-shore series results in Australia (November 2019), England (August 2020) and recently in New Zealand (Dec-Jan 2020-21). At one stage the jobs of head coach Misbahul Haq and bowling coach Waqar Younis were at stake. However, the home Test series victory against South Africa has come as a breath of fresh air for the PCB, the team and its management.
South Africa hold a slight edge over Pakistan in their head-to-head T20 record. The former have won eight games out of 14 while the Green Shirts came out victorious in six. Pakistan lost the three-match series 2-1 when they last faced the Proteas in a T20 rubber staged in their backyard in February 2019.
The second and third T20 matches of the series will be staged on Saturday and Sunday, also at Gaddafi Stadium.

"Strategy needed to foil Delhi’s plan to change held Kashmir’s demography
","February 10, 2021","ISLAMABAD: President of Azad Jammu and Kashmir Sardar Masood Khan on Tuesday said a strategy was urgently needed to foil Indian plans to change the demography of occupied Kashmir.
“If we do not do anything immediately,… couple of years later whatsoever we will do will be too little, too late,” he said at a webinar hosted by the Strategic Vision Institute on ‘Assessing Pakistan’s Kashmir Policy: A Medium to Long-term Strategy’.  
The AJK president warned that the situation in occupied Kashmir was changing at a lightning pace since its annexation by India. He said that although massacre of the Kashmiris and human rights violations were continuing unabated in the held valley, the foremost challenge facing the Kashmiris was that of demographic change.
India had after annexing occupied Kashmir on Aug 5, 2019 changed domicile laws and annulled the special rights of the Kashmiris over land ownership and jobs in the disputed region. The Modi government has given nearly two million domiciles to outsiders since the change in the rules.
Mr Khan expressed worries that millions more would be brought in during the next couple of years to dilute the Kashmiri identity.  
Speaking about Pakistan’s strategy on Kashmir, he contended that the weakest part of the effort was the political component. “Our political parties are not adequately interfacing with the rest of the word. Let us reach out to our interlocutors and urge them to call a spade a spade,” he stressed.  
President Khan said the “Indian genociders” needed to be held accountable for the crimes committed against the people of held Kashmir. 
He regretted that the world had given carte blanche to India by ignoring its atrocities in occupied Kashmir and non-implementation of the UN resolutions. “They are looking at the Kashmir dispute through Delhi’s prism because of economic and strategic considerations,” he maintained and added that by doing so the world was underwriting the ongoing genocide in occupied Kashmir.  
He also urged Pakistani businesses to boycott Indian products.",Pakistan
"Subsidiary to be set up to lease  PSM, court told
","February 10, 2021","ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court was told on Tuesday that a subsidiary or a special purpose vehicle (SPV) of the Pakistan Steel Mills (PSM) is likely to be set up by the end of this month that would take away the whopping liability of about Rs450 billion to make the bleeding mill free of all encumbrances. 
This initiative would help attracting the strategic private investor to get the much- needed capital investment and thus revive the existing PSM plant to its production capacity of 1.1 million tonnes per year that will be enhanced gradually to 3m tonnes per year by bringing efficient modern technology besides creating job opportunities for professional and skilled manpower, the SC was told. 
The ambitious plan was presented by federal Privatisation Minister Mohammadmian Soomro before a three-judge bench, headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Gulzar Ahmed, that had taken up a case relating to the fate of the PSM. 
The chief justice regretted that Indus­tries Secretary Afzal Latif and Priva­tisation Secretary Hasan Nasir Jamy were not forthcoming in sharing information about revival of the steel mill. 
The chief justice wondered why not the daily expenditure of Rs20m be recovered from the secretaries, also regretting that none of the secretaries was well versed even about the PSM’s downstream projects when they were preparing to sell off the mills. 
A huge sum of government funds was being drained and going in the air for the last many years but since the money did not belong to the secretaries they were not bothered, the chief justice deplored. 
Mr Soomro explained that the SVP scheme had been designed in the absence of working and the government was negotiating with several interested parties from China, Korea and Russia etc. 
When the chief justice recalled the 2,006 apex court judgement against privatisation of the PSM, Planning and Development Minister Asad Umar conceded that the judgement was in the field and to avoid violation of the verdict the SPV was being created and the PSM was being leased through competitive bidding. 
Advocate Shahid Amjad Bajwa informed the court that according to experts, $500m was needed to revive the mills to its original production capacity of 1.1m tons per annum, $750m to enhance it to 2m tons and $900m to $1 billion to further increase the capacity to 3m tons per annum. 
Justice Ijaz-ul-Ahsan, a member of the bench, regretted that for the last many years the state enterprise was on government grants and thus bleeding the economy and as the time passed, it added to the losses of the mill. 
“We used to manufacture ships and now are ordering foreign countries to build the same for us despite the fact that we have all the facilities available in the country,” the chief justice deplored, adding that if the situation persisted, the entire land of the PSM would be sold and the machinery scrapped thus depriving the country of its assets. 
When the PSM was not earning a penny for years, why it was keeping its workers and why its chairman was roaming around abroad, the chief justice wondered. 
“Since we are at the receiving end and at the disadvantaged position, the investor may dictate its own terms during negotiations,” he feared. 
The chief justice was worried that the negotiations on the steels mill might end up in international arbitration like in many other cases.  
He was also bitter that all state enterprises, including the Heavy Mechanical Complex, Karachi Shipyard and PIA, were shutting down one by one. 
The Supreme Court appointed senior counsel Rashid A. Razvi as a conciliator to work out a workable arrangement for the settlement between the management and different workers’ unions of the PSM regarding layoff plans when the mill was shut. The plan will be placed before the court in two weeks. 
Meanwhile in its report, the PSM stated that the Privatisation Commission planned to undertake pre-qualification of investors, who would submit the interest in response to the expression of interest and statements of qualification, and then invite pre-qualified interested parties. 
The commission envisaged, the report said, to conduct bidding for the SPV in the third quarter of 2,021 and the financial closure and commencement of the business would depend on timelines agreed to with successful bidder in the share purchase agreement. 
Under the approved transaction structure by the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation, the core operating assets — including the PSM plant and machinery namely coke oven and by-product, sintering plant, iron making department, steel making plant, cold rolling mills, galvanising plant, cold formed section, refractory plant and oxygen plant besides power generation plant and 1,268 acres of land comprising only seven per cent of the total PSM land area of over 19,000 acres — would be leased out to the newly formed SPV, the report said.",Newspaper
"17 lawyers issued contempt notices for attacking IHC building
","February 10, 2021","ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday issued contempt of court notices to 17 lawyers including Islamabad Bar Council member Naseer Kayani and candidates vying for top position of the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) election scheduled to be held on Feb 27. 
The recipient of the contempt of court notices included IHCBA’s presidential candidate Raja Zahid, candidate for secretary Tasadduq Hanif and joint secretary’s candidate Yasmin Sindu. 
Notices were also issued to Ahsan Majeed Gujjar, Arbab Ayub Gujjar, Faisal Jadoon, Farzana Mughal, Hamad Dar, Nazia Abbasi, Shaista Tabassum, Kulsoom Rafique, Kamran Yousafzai, Hafiz Malik Mazhar Javed, Khalid Mehmood, Raja Amjad and Raja Farrukh. 
The lawyers were among those 400 who stormed the IHC on building on Feb 8, injured the IHC’s staff and manhandled a journalist, besides damaging the furniture and smashing the window of the Chief Justice Block. 
The police registered an FIR against 21 lawyers under various sections of the Pakistan Penal Code and Anti Terrorism Act (ATA). 
Meanwhile, a joint session of the IBC, IHCBA and District Bar Association at the Islamabad Bar Council discussed the situation. A joint resolution by the elected representatives of the lawyers condemned demolition of chambers and also regretted the lawyers attack on the IHC. 
They demanded withdrawal of the FIR registered against the lawyers. 
They also demanded removal of the district and sessions judge (west) and action against officials of the Capital Development Authority (CDA) and the district administration who demolished the lawyers chambers. The lawyers’ bodies also issued strike call to protest the demolition of chambers and manhandling of lawyers. 
Moreover, 70 young lawyers also issued a joint statement to condemn the attack on the IHC. 
The statement said as videos from the scene clearly show a section of lawyers attacking the chambers, causing destruction to property and threatening members of the judiciary.  
These actions do not merely merit moral condemnation; they violate criminal law of the country as well as canons of professional ethics and must be dealt with, accordingly. 
We note with great dismay that it has had to come to this point. This is but one instance in a growing trend of lawlessness within the legal community.  
Recently, a video surfaced in which lawyers were seen threatening to burn down a police station in reaction to any attempt to counteract their illegal encroachment.  
If, those entrusted with the discipline of the profession had played their role, things would not have come to this pass, the statement said. 
It is highly disappointing that the Islamabad Bar Council has failed to regulate the conduct of lawyers. It is due to the failure of the Islamabad Bar Council that the situation has reached to today’s incidents where members of the bar attacked the Islamabad High Court without fear, the statement concluded. 
Security has been strengthened in and around Capital Development Authority (CDA) office, district and sessions courts, and chief commissioner complex, keeping in view the attack on Islamabad High Court (IHC) by lawyers on Monday.  
Officers of the capital administration and police said well-equipped contingents of police, including anti-riot unit and anti-terrorism force, were deployed in and around the CDA office. Paramilitary troops are also assisting the police.
Besides, barbed wire and blockades were put on the road leading towards the CDA office. The security was provide after reports that the lawyers planned a protest at the CDA office over demolition of their chambers.
In a similar move, paramilitary troops along with police were deployed in and around the districts and session courts. Security around courtrooms was also strengthened. Roads adjacent to the the IHC were closed by putting barbed wire and blockades and police and troops were deployed there.
Security of Margalla and Ramna police stations has also been enhanced.
Scores of lawyers’ chambers around the district and sessions courts  were demolished in an operation conducted by the CDA, capital  administration and police on Sunday night.  
The CDA issued 100 more notices to lawyers on Tuesday, asking them to vacate and demolish their chambers as they were illegal, officials said.
It was stated in the notices that footpaths, pathways and parking areas had been occupied and illegal constructions made there. The lawyers were asked to vacate the illegal structures and demolish them otherwise action would be taken without any further notice.  
Senior police officers met the top judicial officer of the high court and discussed security of the courts and law and order situation after demolition of the lawyers’ chambers.
The senior police officers also held a meeting to chalk out further strategy to maintain law and order and security of the courts and other buildings.Two cases have been registered against 266 lawyers at Ramna and Margalla police stations after the lawyers attacked the IHC premises.

"1bn saplings to be planted by mid-2021: PM’s aide
","February 10, 2021","ISLAMABAD: The government will successfully achieve its target of planting one billion saplings by the middle of this year, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Climate Change Malik Amin Aslam said on Tuesday while addressing participants of a press conference.
“The biggest weapon to tackle challenges of climate change is the Ten Billion Tree Tsunami initiative. As we restore destroyed forests, in the first phase the plan is to plant 3.2 billion saplings till 2023. We call it the Ten Billion Tree Tsunami because the present government is here to stay. We are on target so far. Numbers of saplings in nurseries across the country have gone from 90 million to 300 million,” he said, adding the first phase of plantation will be completed by June/July 2021.
Pakistan has been listed among the top ten countries, most vulnerable to impacts of climate change since the last two decades. This issue must be addressed urgently for the survival of future generations as it affects economy, water resources, national security and so on.
“Scientific study shows that average temperature in Pakistan has risen by 1°C. This may seem less but the rise can be disastrous especially for agriculture and the economy. The variability of rains has increased by 20pc. This means the timing of rainy seasons have shifted, while summers have extended. Every year an extra day is added to the summer season,” he said.
According to the SAPM, urban flooding such as the one witnessed in Karachi last monsoon, was a new threat as cities and towns turn into concrete jungles. “Today Karachi has turned into a heat island. The previous government is responsible for wiping out 70pc trees and greenery in Lahore alone. These phenomena are a reality. The best solution is planting more trees, especially in cities. The numbers of glacial lakes in Pakistan’s North have also increased from 50 to 130, according to estimates, in just three years, which is ‘very’ alarming for us,” he added.
Several projects fall under the TBTT initiative such as increasing the number of protected areas, bee harvesting and establishment of a wildlife conservation centre in Islamabad. The PM will soon announce more areas the government intends to protect.
These projects are being monitored by provinces, then by the federal government and thirdly by third parties like Pakistan Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco), World Wildlife Fund (WWF), International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which will present yearly reports, he added, while sharing images and videos in his presentation.
The videos showed various barren locations, some freed from land mafia where the Ministry of Climate Change had planted forests a year ago that are now flourishing into forests.
“The international community, ministers, artists and especially environmental organisations, have recognized success of the TBTT initiative asking all nations to follow Pakistan’s example. Climate change will remain a challenge, which ever government comes into power. The best solution is planting as many trees as possible,” he added.",Pakistan
"SA to give their best in Twenty20 series, says Klaasen
","February 10, 2021","LAHORE: Showing no worries over his country’s  recent 2-0 drubbing in the Test series against Pakistan, South Africa’s Twenty20 captain Heinrich Klaasen on Tuesday said his side would be giving their best in the upcoming series of the game’s shortest format.
The three-match series starts here on Thursday, with all the matches to be held at the Gaddafi Stadium.
“Look  it was different [Test]  squad and as I was not involved in that series, fairly I have no comment over that series. But yes in the T20 series our boys will be giving their best as they are here to represent their country,” Klaasen, who will play his first game since Dec 3 when he was tested positive for Covid-19 during the white-ball series against England at home, said.
Wicket-keeper/batsman Klaasen, who has so far played 13 T20 Internationals and will lead South Africa for the first time in the Pakistan T20 series, said the entire coaching staff had joined the T20 squad from Rawalpindi in Lahore last night.
The South African T20 team has been practising in Lahore for the last five days while its Test squad was busy in Rawalpindi, playing the second Test, which they lost by 95 runs after losing the first Test by seven wickets in Karachi.
Klaasen, 29,  negated the impression that in fact his was a second-string South African side, insisting the team had a good combination and would give its best against Pakistan to win the series.
The South African T20 squad is without seasoned campaigners like Quinton de Kock, Kagiso Rabada, Faf du Plessis, Rassie van der Dussen and Lungi Ngidi as all of them returned with the Test squad as per previous plan to meet Australia in the Test series at home.
Though the series was cancelled after Australia’s recent withdrawal due to Covid-19 risk, the South African Test players could not change their travelling plan due to shortage of time.
Those who have been retained include head coach Mark Boucher and assistant coach Enoch Nkwe, who have been joined by South African ‘A’ coach Malibongwe Maketa and Dolphins franchise coach Imran Khan. 
Charl Langeveldt and Justin Ontong, the bowling and fielding coach respectively, have also gone back home with the Test squad.  
About his own fitness after recovering from the Covid-19 virus, Klaasen said though he was playing first match after more than two months, he was confident that in the practice sessions he had been striking the ball well. 
“I have played only four matches which has been frustrating so it is difficult to tell you what my form is like. We will see after these [T20] games, however, I am hitting the ball really nicely to get some rhythm,” he said.
Klaasen also shared his experience of isolation and warned the cricketers to be aware of the Covid-19 virus.",Newspaper

"Jirga demands reversal of Fata-KP merger
","February 10, 2021","KHYBER: Khyber Qaumi Jirga (KQJ) has demanded immediate separation of tribal districts from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, saying the merger has pushed the region into further backwardness and deprivation.
The demand was made during a jirga held in Jamrud on Tuesday that was attended by tribal elders of Khyber, Mohmand and Darra Adamkhel with KQJ chief Malak Bismillah Khan in the chair.
Addressing the jirga, Malak Bismillah Khan termed the merger a historic blunder and said that tribal areas were merged with the province at the behest of the United States under a foreign agenda.
He said that those, who supported the merger, were also now repenting their decision as the government failed to honour its promises and commitments made with the people of tribal areas before enforcement of the merger plan.
Demanding a separate province consisting of merged districts, the KQJ chief said that only the status of a separate province could help to alleviate the miseries and sufferings of the militancy-affected people of tribal areas.
“Both the federal and provincial governments are now backtracking on their promises of three per cent share in National Finance Commission, increase in share of jobs both at national and provincial level and above all bringing the impoverished region at par with the rest of the country in 10 years,” he said.
Speaking on the occasion, Malak Razaq Afridi called upon the mainstream political leadership of the country to support them in their demand for repeal of Fata’s merger through constitutional means and granting erstwhile Fata the status of a separate province.
He alleged that the merger was in fact aimed at depriving the people of the region of their natural resources and pushing the area into further poverty and deprivation.
Malak Razaq said that KQJ would soon launch a countrywide anti-merger campaign and would take all the stakeholders on board for a prompt repeal of the plan.",Pakistan
"NAB chief promises support to Broadsheet probe body
","February 10, 2021","PESHAWAR: National Accountability Bureau chairman retired Justice Javed Iqbal on Tuesday promised the anti-corruption watchdog’s complete cooperation to the single-member Broadsheet Inquiry Commission regarding the UK-based asset recovery company’s revelations about corruption and money laundering in Pakistan and said the current NAB administration had nothing do with the Broadsheet issue.
During a visit to the NAB regional headquarters here, Mr Iqbal said the NAB agreement with the Broadsheet company was signed in 2000 and came to an end in 2003.
“The inquiry commission has become functional and the NAB will extend all-out support to it,” he said.  The NAB chairman said 1,230 corruption references had been pending with accountability courts across the country about the misappropriation of around Rs943 billion.
“The NAB intends to file applications with accountability courts for early hearing into these references,” he said.
Mr Iqbal said the NAB was a human-friendly institution that always extended respect to those functioning in accordance with the Constitution and law and therefore, bureaucracy should not be apprehensive towards it.
“The NAB has no relation with any political party, group or individual and that it respects all politicians in line with the requirements of the law,” he said.
The NAB chairman said an accused was produced before the court within 24 hours of arrest and that the court had powers to remand him or her in the custody of the bureau.
He said the NAB was the only institution, which had signed a memorandum of understanding with the Chinese government for overlooking projects under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor initiative.
Mr Iqbal said international organisations of repute, including Transparency International, World Economic Forum and Global Peace Canada, had hailed the NAB’s performance.
He said the bureau was a role model for Saarc countries and was a focal institution in the country under the UN Convention against Corruption.
“We have decided to start refresher courses for our officials on scientific basis keeping in view the modern day requirements. We have also been taking steps for improving monitoring and evaluation mechanism, preparation of references on the basis of concrete evidence, and effective prosecution in the courts so that corrupt elements should not receive any relief,” he said.
The NAB chairman said propaganda was launched against his organisation by the elements, which didn’t want to be answerable for their actions.
He said the bureau not only made those elements answerable but also filed cases and references against them and made huge recoveries.
Mr Iqbal said the NAB didn’t yield to negative propaganda, allegations and threats and made the people, who had not ever dreamt to be questioned, answerable for their deeds. He said the NAB had recovered around Rs487 billion during his three years long tenure as the chairman.
Earlier, NAB Khyber Pakhtunkhwa director general retired Brigadier Farooq Nasir Awan informed the chairman that currently, 182 references were pending with accountability courts in Peshawar.
He said the bureau had been scrutinising 68 complaints and conducting inquiry into 95 complaints and full-fledge investigation into 36 complaints.
The DG said during the last three years, the NAB KP had recovered Rs3.018 billion, which was deposited in the exchequer.
He said in several cases, the money looted from the people over fake housing projects were recovered and returned to their owners.",Pakistan
"Multinational military drill 'to give Pakistan diplomatic push'
","February 10, 2021","Hosted by Pakistan, a week-long multination naval exercise is set to begin in the Arabian Sea from Thursday, a move that could set the tone for its enhanced bilateral relations with many countries, experts said.
Naval forces from 45 countries, including the United States, China, Russia and Turkey are participating in Aman-2021 from February 11-16.
Russia will join the military drill with Nato members for the first time in a decade, a development considered significant. The last time Russian and Nato naval forces took part in a joint exercise was at the Bold Monarch 2011 off the coast of Spain.
Organised under the slogan, 'Together for Peace', Pakistan Navy says the exercise is aimed at “fostering international cooperation to fight piracy, terrorism, and other crimes”, which pose a threat to maritime security and stability.
“In the given circumstances, bringing together 45 countries, including rivals, is noteworthy,“ retired Lt Gen Talat Masood, an Islamabad-based security analyst, told 
, referring to Washington’s escalating diplomatic tensions with Moscow and Beijing.
The biannual exercise also gives Russia and Nato members an opportunity to engage militarily, he added.
“The exercise will also serve as a diplomatic push for Islamabad,” said Masood, who served in the Pakistan Army from 1951 to 1990. “Pakistan has shown that it has expanded its diplomatic clout to the point where it can bring together the countries that otherwise are hostile to each other.”
Munawar Hussain Panhwar, an assistant professor at the Quaid-i-Azam International University in Islamabad, said the rare military contact between Russia and the US is in accordance with US President Joe Biden’s policy of ""engagement"".
The drill, he added, would also give a push to Islamabad’s efforts to boost defence and military ties with Russia — a longtime Indian ally.
“This could allow Islamabad to further underpin defense and military ties with its traditional allies, as well as look for new regional and international partners, at least in the defense sector,” he told 
.
Referring to the participation of several South and East Asian nations, including Bangladesh, Masood said: ""It will send a message to India that Pakistan is not an isolated country, but a willing partner with other nations.""
Already frosty relations between the two nuclear neighbours have further plummeted in recent years, particularly after New Delhi’s scrapping of the semi-autonomous status of the Indian-occupied Kashmir in August 2019.
Islamabad has also accused New Delhi of supporting militants based in Afghanistan and sabotaging infrastructure projects such as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. 
Pahnwar, who teaches international relations, said the event is an opportunity for Islamabad to further consolidate its geographical importance. Pakistan is bounded by Iran, Afghanistan, China and India.
Ishtiaq Ahmad, a security analyst and vice chancellor of Sargodha University in Punjab, said that by bringing together powers with competing interests in the Indian Ocean, ""Pakistan has contributed to regional peace and stability.""",World
"Elon Musk wants clean power but Tesla's carrying Bitcoin's dirty baggage
","February 10, 2021","Tesla boss Elon Musk is a poster child of low-carbon technology. Yet the electric carmaker’s 
 this week could turbo-charge global use of a currency that’s estimated to cause more pollution than a small country every year.
Tesla Inc revealed on Monday it had bought $1.5 billion of bitcoin and would soon accept it as payment for cars, sending the price of the cryptocurrency 
.
So what’s the problem, you may ask? bitcoin’s virtual, so it’s not like it’s made from paper or plastic, or even metal.
The digital currency is created when high-powered computers compete against other machines to solve complex mathematical puzzles, an energy-intensive process that currently often relies on fossil fuels, particularly coal, the dirtiest of them all.
At current rates, such bitcoin “mining” devours about the same amount of energy annually as the Netherlands did in 2019, the latest available data from the University of Cambridge and the International Energy Agency shows.
Bitcoin production is estimated to generate between 22 and 22.9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions a year, or between the levels produced by Jordan and Sri Lanka, according to a 2019 study in scientific journal 
.
The landmark inclusion of the cryptocurrency in Tesla’s investment portfolio could complicate the company’s zero-emissions ethos, according to some investors, at a time when environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations have become a major factor for global investors.
“We are of course very concerned about the level of carbon dioxide emissions generated from bitcoin mining,” said Ben Dear, CEO of Osmosis Investment Management, a sustainable investor managing around $2.2bn in assets that holds Tesla stock in several portfolios.
“We hope that when Tesla’s bitcoin ventures are over, they will concentrate on measuring and disclosing to their market their full suite of environmental factors, and if they continue to buy or indeed start mining bitcoin, that they include the relevant energy consumption data in these disclosures.”
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.
Still, it’s not all eco-doom and gloom, and Tesla’s bet on bitcoin comes amid growing attempts in the cryptocurrency industry to mitigate the environmental harm of mining. This movement could be advanced by billionaire entrepreneur Musk, who this week separately offered $100m for inventions that could pull carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or oceans.
The entrance of big corporations into the crypto-market could also boost incentives to produce “green bitcoin” using renewable energy, some sustainability experts say. They add that companies could buy carbon credits to compensate too.
Yet in the shorter term, Tesla’s disclosure of its bitcoin investment, made in a securities filing, could indirectly serve to exacerbate the environmental costs of mining.
Other companies are likely to follow its lead by buying into the currency, investors and industry experts say. Greater demand, and higher prices, lead to more miners competing to solve puzzles in the fastest time to win coin, using increasingly powerful computers that need more energy.
“It’s [bitcoin] not a sustainable investment and it’s hard to make it sustainable with the kind of system it is built on,” said Sanna Setterwall, a consultant at corporate sustainability advisory South Pole.
Estimates on bitcoin’s reliance on fossil fuels versus renewables vary, with detailed data on the bitcoin mining industry’s energy mix hard to come by.
Projects from Canada to Siberia are striving for ways to wean bitcoin mining away from fossil fuels, or at least to reduce its carbon footprint, and make the currency more palatable to mainstream investors.
SJ Oh, a former bitcoin trader based in Hong Kong and a self-professed “tree-hugger”, was aware that his passion for the environment was somewhat at odds with his day job. So a year ago he co-founded Pow.re, a firm that runs green bitcoin mining operations in the Canadian subarctic.
Located in Labrador, Pow.re’s machines run on hydropower, with plans to repurpose the heat generated by the mining to serve local agriculture, heating and other needs, he said.
“Overwhelmingly, I do think there will be a concerted effort by the bitcoin industry to be environmentally friendly,” said Oh, who believes Musk and his company can come up with better methods.
“Tesla is one of the greenest companies on the planet so I’m sure they’ll figure it out.”
Other projects aimed at reducing bitcoin’s carbon impact include that run by an arm of Russian gas producer Gazprom in the Khanty-Mansi region of Siberia.
There, power generated by flare gas — a by-product from oil extraction usually burned off — is used for cryptocurrency mining. The process leaves a lower carbon footprint than coal power, said Gazprom Neft, the unit behind the project.
In theory, blockchain analysis firms say, it is possible to track the source of bitcoin, raising the possibility that a premium could be charged for green bitcoin. Stronger climate change policies by governments around the world might also help.
“It’s not so much bitcoin that is the problem.” said Yves Bennaim, the founder of 2B4CH, a Switzerland-based cryptocurrency think-tank.
“People are saying it’s energy intensive therefore it’s polluting, but that is just the nature of the energy we are using today. As bitcoin goes up there will be more incentive to make investments in renewable sources of energy.”
Some bitcoin proponents note, meanwhile, that the existing financial system with its millions of employees and computers in air-conditioned offices uses large amounts of energy too.
However it is early days for such green projects, and some ESG experts say bitcoin could have a tough task being accepted by mainstream investors en masse in the foreseeable future.
“I still think the big players will refrain from bitcoin for these particular reasons — one [there] being a very negative climate angle to it, given the way it’s mined, and two, the compliance and ethical issues related to it,” said Sasja Beslik, head of sustainable business development at Bank J Safra Sarasin in Zurich.
Some industry players and academics warn that the dominance of Chinese miners and lack of motivation to swap cheap fossil fuels for more expensive renewables means there are few quick fixes to the emissions problem.
Chinese miners account for about 70 per cent of bitcoin production, data from the University of Cambridge’s Centre for Alternative Finance shows. They tend to use renewable energy — mostly hydropower — during the rainy summer months, but fossil fuels — primarily coal — for the rest of the year.
“Every miner’s objective is making a profit, so they don’t care about what kind of energy they use, if it is generated by hydro, wind, solar or burning coal,” said Jack Liao, CEO of Chinese mining firm LightningAsic, adding that government incentives for miners to favor renewable energy might help.
Others are less optimistic that significant change is on the horizon.
“Production of renewables is extremely volatile, it’s not ideal as a consistent form of power,” said Alex De Vries, the founder of research platform Digiconomist.
“The problem is that the miners that will last the longest will be the ones using cheap fossil fuels, simply because it is the cheapest and more stable source.”",World
"Yemen rebel attack on Saudi airport sets plane on fire
","February 10, 2021","Yemen’s Houthi rebels on Wednesday targeted an airport in southwestern Saudi Arabia causing a civilian plane on the tarmac to catch fire, the kingdom’s state television reported, an attack that threatened to escalate Yemen’s grinding war.
No one was hurt in the assault, but the damaged passenger plane at Abha airport served as a powerful reminder of the danger that Houthi rebels pose to Saudi Arabia, which nearly six years ago launched a bombing campaign that has devastated the Arab world’s poorest country.
The Iran-aligned Houthis soon claimed responsibility for the assault, with military spokesman Yehia Sarea stressing that the Houthis consider Abha airport to be a military, not civilian, target.
“This targeting comes in response to the continued aerial bombardment and the brutal siege of our country,” Sarea said, adding the group attacked with four bomb-laden drones.
Col Turki al-Maliki, the spokesman for the Saudi-led military coalition fighting in Yemen, said forces earlier intercepted and destroyed two drones launched by Houthis toward the country’s south. He condemned the assault as a “systematic and deliberate attempt to target civilians”.
“The attempt to target Abha airport is a war crime and put civilian travellers’ lives in danger,” the coalition statement said, adding that the aircraft was on the ground at the time and that the fire was brought under control.
Photographs later aired by Saudi state television showed the aircraft, a three-year-old Airbus A320 flown by low-cost carrier FlyADeal. It appeared the drone had punched a hole through its fuselage, with scorch marks on the metal. An anchor on state television said there were no injuries on the ground from the fire. FlyADeal did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Since 2015, the Houthis battling the Saudi-led military coalition have targeted international airports, along with military installations and critical oil infrastructure, within Saudi Arabia. The Houthis repeatedly have used drones against Saudi Arabia, including crashing them into the kingdom’s Patriot missile batteries, most recently on Sunday when the coalition said it intercepted five “booby-trapped” drones. Those attacks, often striking near the southern cities of Abha and Jizan, have wounded dozens and killed at least one person in recent years.
As recently as late January, US forces stationed at Prince Sultan Air Base near Riyadh trained Saudi troops on how to counter the threat posed by drones, which can fly low to the ground, evade radar and detonate against targets in the kingdom.
In November 2017, the Houthis even reached Riyadh’s international airport, deep inside the kingdom. No one was hurt in the attack, which marked the first time that a Houthi missile had come so close to a heavily populated centre. Riyadh is around 620 miles (1,000 kilometres) north of the border with Yemen.
Saudi officials have blamed Iran for providing ballistic missiles to the Houthis used in such attacks against the kingdom. Tehran denies arming the Houthis, despite evidence to the contrary.
Pakistan strongly condemned the drone attack on Abha airport. 
""These attacks threaten peace and security of Saudi Arabia, as well as the region. We call for the immediate cessation of such attacks,"" the Foreign Office said in a statement.
""Pakistan reiterates its full support and solidarity with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia against any threats to its security and territorial integrity,"" it added. 
The attack late Wednesday afternoon reportedly was the first to impact a civilian aircraft at the facility. Flight-tracking websites showed delayed and cancelled flights scheduled to either take off or land at the airport. Flights at Abha airport resumed some time after the attack.
The US Air Force’s Central Command, based at Al-Udeid Air Base in neighbouring Qatar, declined to comment on the assault.
In recent weeks, the Houthis have accelerated their push to wrest control of Yemen’s oil-rich government stronghold of Marib and escalated their cross-border attacks on the kingdom. On Tuesday, UN envoy Martin Griffiths said he was “extremely concerned” about hostilities in Marib, especially at a time of “renewed diplomatic momentum” to end the war.
Yemen’s war started in 2014, when the rebels seized the capital, Sanaa, and much of the country’s north. Saudi Arabia, along with the United Arab Emirates and other countries, intervened months later to dislodge the Houthis and restore the internationally recognised government. The war has killed some 130,000 people and spawned the world’s worst humanitarian disaster.
President Joe Biden has turned a spotlight on the brutal conflict, declaring last week that the United States would 
 of the Saudi-led military offensive, including “relevant” arms sales. The administration has also moved to lift a terrorist designation against the Houthis, citing the need to mitigate Yemen’s humanitarian crisis.
But Biden stressed that the US would continue to help Saudi Arabia defend itself against outside attacks, as part of maintaining key security, counterterrorism and military ties with the kingdom, a strategic partner and global oil giant.",World
"PM advises Sri Lanka to benefit from CPEC
","February 24, 2021","COLOMBO: Pakistan and Sri Lanka on Tuesday agreed to further strengthen bilateral relations in diverse areas, including trade, investment, science and technology, tourism and culture through enhanced connectivity.
“My visit is aimed at strengthening bilateral relationship [with Sri Lanka], especially trade and economic ties through enhanced connectivity,” Prime Minister Imran Khan said while addressing a joint press conference with his Sri Lankan counterpart Mahinda Rajapaksa here after holding a one-on-one meeting, followed by delegation-level talks.
Since Pakistan is part of the Chinese president’s Belt and Road Initiative through its flagship China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project, Sri Lanka could benefit from it through enhanced connectivity up to the Central Asian states, said Prime Minister Khan who along with Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Commerce Adviser Abdul Razzak Dawood and Special Assistant Syed Zulfikar Abbas Bukhari is on a two-day visit to Sri Lanka on the invitation of PM Rajapaksa.
Around 40 leading Pakistani businessmen are also accompanying the prime minister during his visit. The Pakistan mission in Colombo has invited 200 top businessmen and investors from Sri Lanka to the joint trade and investment conference being held in Colombo on Wednesday (today) by the commerce ministry and the Trade Development Authority of Pakistan.
Prime Minister Khan and his counterpart will also grace the conference. On the sidelines an opportunity will be provided to the two business communities representing the key sectors of textile, pharmaceutical, construction, information technology, agro and food, tourism, footwear, hospitality and tourism to engage in effective B2B meetings for enhanced cooperation.
While addressing a joint presser with his Sri Lankan counterpart Mahinda Rajapaksa, PM Khan told the media that he had asked his delegation to find ways and means to enhance trade and economic relations between the two countries through increased connectivity. While highlighting the importance of resolving disputes through dialogue and promoting the vision of peace, progress and prosperity in South Asia and beyond, he underlined the imperative of constructive engagement by all sides to promote a political solution to the conflict in Afghanistan.
Pakistan’s shifting focus from geostrategic to geo-economics was discussed at the meeting during which the three pillars of Pakistan’s vision — peace, development partnerships, and connectivity — were underscored. The two sides reiterated their commitment to the principles and objectives of Saarc charter and agreed to take forward the Saarc process for regional cooperation.
Mr Khan said with Pakistan having faced the worst kind of terrorism that claimed over 70,000 lives in a decade and Sri Lanka also facing the menace for 30 years, the two countries shared the common problem. He also mentioned the role played by Pakistan in addressing the problem that was hindering Sri Lanka’s progress and development.
The premier said there hardly came any investment during the 10 years amid the wave of terrorism in Pakistan. Then coronavirus hit the economy of both countries, he said, highlighting the need for getting debt relief from the developed world as well as the international financial institutions besides urging the United Nations and other international institutions to step in to help the developing nations. He explained that Pakistan had provided a stimulus package of $8 billion compared to $3,000bn provided by the US to its people.
Coming back to the bilateral relations, PM Khan said Pakistan having various heritage sites was home to ancient civilizations of Gandhara and Budhism and called for enhanced cooperation between the two countries in tourism. He also extended an invitation to his Sri Lankan counterpart to visit Pakistan.
Mr Khan, the first head of government to visit Sri Lanka after President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa assumed office last year, said he had been visiting Sri Lanka and played cricket there, recalling how Sri Lankan cricket team revolutionised and became the world class team.
Sri Lankan Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa told the media persons that they discussed regional and international issues of mutual interest, besides ways and means to strengthen bilateral ties.
He said during the meeting, the two sides agreed to enhance cooperation between Pakistan and Sri Lanka in diverse areas including trade, investment, science and technology, education and culture.
On the occasion, PM Khan and his Sri Lankan counterpart witnessed the signing of five memorandums of understanding (MOUs) for enhanced bilateral cooperation in the fields of investment, science and technology, and industrial technology.
According to Pakistan’s Foreign Office, the reconstitution of the Sri Lanka-Pakistan Parliamentary Friendship Association will also be announced during the visit to further promote parliamentary exchanges between the two countries.
A Sri Lankan foreign ministry statement said the visit would feature a business and investment forum, as well as a sports diplomacy initiative.
This is the fourth high-level engagement between Pakistan and Sri Lanka witnessed in last few months since the Sixth Foreign Secretary Level Bilateral Political Consultations in December 2020, followed by the 12th Session of Joint Economic Commission.
Meanwhile, 
 reported that Sri Lankan Muslims protested near the president’s office demanding that the government allow people who die of Covid-19 to be buried instead of cremated. They believe Mr Khan would take up the burial issue as well with the Sri Lankan leadership.
Earlier, PM Rajapaksa received Mr Khan on his arrival here at the Bandaranaike International Airport this afternoon.",Newspaper
"Myanmar junta’s top diplomat in talks with Thailand, Indonesia
","February 25, 2021","BANGKOK: The Myanmar junta’s foreign minister visited Thailand on Wednesday as regional powers tried to broker an end to three weeks of deadly unrest triggered by a military coup.
The talks came as an anti-coup protester died in detention, a local rescue organisation said. Four others have been killed in the crackdown.
Foreign minister Wunna Maung Lwin held talks with his counterparts from Thailand and Indonesia in what was the first known face-to-face meetings between a senior junta member and foreign government officials.
The military has weathered a storm of international condemnation for ousting civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi from power in a Feb 1 putsch, while dissent within its borders has been vociferous with daily nationwide protests.
Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said she expressed concerns about the safety and welfare of Myanmar citizens and reiterated a need for an  “inclusive democratic transition process”.
“We ask all parties to exercise restraint and not use violence to avoid casualties and bloodshed,” she told reporters in Jakarta.
Marsudi has been on a  “shuttle diplomacy” mission over the past two weeks discussing the Myanmar crisis during visits to Brunei and Singapore as well as phone calls with other Southeast Asian counterparts.
She had hoped to travel to Naypyidaw after her visit to Bangkok to directly convey messages from Indonesia and other countries but confirmed the visit had to be postponed.
Earlier on Wednesday, the Indonesian embassy in Myanmar’s commercial hub Yangon saw hundreds of protesters gather for the second consecutive day.
Angered that Jakarta was talking with the junta government — officially named the State Administration Council — demonstrators carried signs reading:  “Stop negotiating with them” and  “Indonesia, don’t support dictator”.
“The Military’s State Administration Council is not our legitimate government,” said participant Seinn Lae Maung, who had a Myanmar flag painted on her face.
“Please respect our votes and do hear our voices.” Marsudi later hit back at the criticism, warning:  “To do nothing is not an option.” Since the Feb 1 coup, Myanmar has seen a torrent of anger and defiance from hundreds of thousands of protesters nationwide demanding the release of Suu Kyi.
The military has justified its actions by alleging widespread electoral fraud in November’s elections, which Suu Kyi’s party had won in a landslide.
Since taking power, the junta has ordered nightly internet blackouts and arrested hundreds of anti-coup protesters, while security forces have steadily stepped up enforcement tactics to quell demonstrations.
They have deployed tear gas, water cannon and rubber bullets against protesters, as well as isolated incidents of live rounds.
The post-coup death toll rose on Wednesday as a 20-year-old man who was arrested and sustained a leg injury at a protest last weekend in Mandalay, Myanmar’s second largest city, died.
“(His mother) ran to me, crying and hugging me, saying her son had died,” said Khin Maung Tint from Mandalay Rescue.
That followed the deaths of three other protesters, including 17-year-old Wai Yan Tun, who was shot in the head Saturday after security forces opened fire during a Mandalay protest.",Newspaper
"Van Gogh painting to be shown in public for first time
","February 25, 2021","PARIS: A painting of a Paris street scene by Vincent Van Gogh is to be shown to the public for the first time, after spending more than a century behind closed doors in the private collection of a French family.
The work, painted by Van Gogh in 1887 while he was lodging with his brother Theo in the French capital, will be put on display by Sotheby’s auction house in Amsterdam, Hong Kong, and Paris, prior to being auctioned off next month.
The auction house put an estimated value on the artwork of between five million euros ($6.08 million) and 8 million euros.
Titled  “A street scene in Montmartre,” the painting depicts a man and woman, strolling arm in arm past a ramshackle fence with a windmill in the background.
The painting is part of a series that Van Gogh produced of scenes in Montmartre, a hilly district of Paris now dominated by the Sacre Coeur church.
When the artist was there, the church was under construction and the area was a patchwork of fields, houses and windmills on the edge of the city that was starting to attract a bohemian artist set with its cheap rents.
The auction house said the painting had been seen in catalogues, but has never itself been on public display. It did not identify the current owner.
Sotheby’s said in a statement that very few paintings from Van Gogh’s Montmartre period remain in private hands.",Newspaper
"Germany convicts Syrian in ‘historic’ torture trial
","February 25, 2021","KOBLENZ: A German court on Wednesday convicted a former Syrian intelligence service agent for complicity in crimes against humanity, in the first court case worldwide over state-sponsored torture by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s government.
Eyad al-Gharib, 44, was sentenced to four and a half years in prison over his role in helping to arrest at least 30 protesters in Duma in autumn 2011 and deliver them to the Al-Khatib detention centre in Damascus where they were tortured.
Almost 10 years since the Arab Spring reached Syria on March 15, 2011, the judgement is the first in the world related to what judge Anne Kerber called  “widespread and systematic repression” of protesters by the regime in Damascus.
Germany’s foreign minister Heiko Maas welcomed the  “historic verdict”, which he said had a  “high symbolic significance for many people, not only in Syria”.
“It is the first verdict that holds those responsible for #torture in #Syria accountable and it at least creates a little justice,” Maas said in a tweet.
The conviction was also hailed as a  “ray of hope” by Syrian Wassim Mukdad, a plaintiff who suffered torture in the Al-Khatib centre, also named  “Branch 251”.
“This is just the beginning and the day will come when Bashar al-Assad and his cronies, the army and intelligence generals are put on trial,” said Mukdad, who testified at the trial. 
Gharib, a former low-ranking member of the intelligence service, hid his face from the cameras with a folder as the verdict was read out, arms folded and wearing a medical mask.
He is the first of two defendants on trial since April 23 to be convicted by the court in Koblenz, after judges decided to split the proceedings in two.
The second defendant, Anwar Raslan, 58, is a former colonel and accused directly of crimes against humanity, including overseeing the murder of 58 people and the torture of 4,000 others. Raslan’s trial is expected to last until at least the end of October.
Both men are being tried on the principle of universal jurisdiction, which allows a foreign country to prosecute crimes against humanity, including war crimes and genocide, regardless of where they were committed. 
Patrick Kroker, a lawyer representing the joint plaintiffs, said Assad’s name was read out  “at least five times during the verdict”, while prosecutor Jasper Klinge said the proceedings sends  “a signal to the perpetrators” of mass crimes in Syria.
Documentary director Firas Fayyad ( “Last Men in Aleppo” and  “The Cave “), who was raped in the Al-Khatib centre, also welcomed the verdict.  “I hope the victims will be able to sleep better tonight. I hope I will be able to sleep,” he said.
Other such cases have also sprung up in Germany, France and Sweden, as Syrians who have sought refuge in Europe turn to the only legal means currently available to them due to a lack of action from the international justice system.
Germany, which took in hundreds of thousands of Syrians in the last years, has been particularly active in pursuing cases against potential suspects.
Besides the ongoing proceedings against former colonel Raslan, a case is underway against a former Syrian doctor who has been charged for crimes against humanity.
Gharib defected in 2012 before finally fleeing Syria in February 2013. He had arrived in Germany on April 25, 2018, after spending time in Turkey and then Greece.
He has never denied his past, and in fact it was his stories told to German authorities in charge of his asylum application that eventually led to his arrest in February 2019.
During the trial, Gharib wrote a letter expressing sorrow for the victims.
He also wept as his lawyers called for his acquittal, arguing that he and his family could have been killed if he had not carried out the orders of the regime.
But the court argued that he  “knew that torture was being practised” in the detention centre, even if he himself had not beaten protesters.
A physical education instructor in the intelligence services for ten years, Gharib was assigned to spy on Friday sermons in Damascus mosques before joining in July 2011 a unit led by a cousin of Bashar al-Assad who was notorious for his brutality.
The trial marked the first time that photos from the so-called Caesar files were presented in a court of law.
The 50,000 images taken by Syrian military police defector  “Caesar” show the corpses of 6,786 Syrians who had been starved or tortured to death inside the Assad regime’s detention centres.",Newspaper
"Officials summoned in industrial waste disposal case
","February 25, 2021","PESHAWAR: A Peshawar High Court bench has summoned Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Environmental Protection Agency director general and Khyber tribal district deputy commissioner and asked them to submit a detailed report about unsafe disposal of effluents of marble manufacturing units and non-compliance of relevant rules in this regard in the district.
The bench of PHC Chief Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan and Justice Mohammad Naeem Anwar ordered that both the officials should appear in person on March 4, the next date of hearing of a petition filed by a resident of Khyber district, Ibrarud Din against unsafe disposal of effluents generated from marble units in Malaguri area of the tribal district.
The PHC chief justice observed that there were several areas in the province where industries were set up but the effluents were dumped in water resources including streams and canals which was not good for human health.
The bench sobered that it did not want to close down industrial units, but would ensure that steps should be taken for safe disposal of industrial effluents.
Advocate Zeeshan Khalil appeared for the petitioner and contended that around 200 marble units were functioning in Khyber without adopting proper safety measures for disposal of effluents.
A representative of EPA told the bench that previously Khyber was part of Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) and the agency had no jurisdiction there.
He said that after the merger of erstwhile Fata into the province, the agency had been exercising its jurisdiction and had completed inspection of around 100 industrial units.
The additional advocate general, Syed Sikander Hayat Shah, told the bench that the officials concerned had issued notices to several marble units for non-compliance of relevant rules about safe disposal of industrial wastes.
The bench observed that effluents of marble units also affected vegetables grown in that area, making it unfit for human consumption.",Pakistan
"IHK & human rights
","February 25, 2021","WHILE the right-wing BJP government in New Delhi has tried to brush the Kashmir issue under the carpet, there is no denying the fact that this is the key obstacle to peace in South Asia. If the Kashmir question is resolved as per the demands of justice, and most importantly, as per the wishes of the Kashmiri people, the temperature in this region is likely to come down very quickly, leading to better relations between India and Pakistan.
Prime Minister Imran Khan 
 has stressed this point, telling a conference in Colombo that “my dream for the subcontinent is that we resolve our differences” and that “we want ... the Kashmir dispute to be resolved according to” the UNSC resolutions.
However, a just resolution of the Kashmir question requires an end to the brutal tactics that India has unleashed in the disputed region, as well as accountability and punishment for those who have violated the people’s fundamental rights. This point was rightly raised by Human Rights Minister Shireen Mazari while 
.
In particular, Dr Mazari slammed the double standards of the self-declared global champions of human rights, who have preferred to keep quiet on the Kashmir issue, even after India stepped up its repressive tactics following the scrapping of the region’s special status in the Indian constitution. They have chosen to “prioritise political, strategic and commercial interests over human rights” she observed, while asking the global community to “stand ... on the right side of history” and call out the grave abuses in India-held Kashmir.
Indeed, many in the West do not lose a moment to castigate geopolitical rivals — China, Venezuela, Iran, North Korea, for example — over real and perceived violations of human rights. However, the violations of clients and partner states are conveniently overlooked, as these states are needed to advance geopolitical agendas, and human rights concerns appear to be expendable. If peace is to come to South Asia, then the brutal human rights violations in IHK must end forthwith, and New Delhi accept the fact that it has perpetrated decades-long abuse in the occupied region.
Once this is done, a framework needs to be created to help resolve the dispute involving the three main stakeholders — Pakistan, India and the Kashmiris. If New Delhi keeps on claiming that Kashmir is an internal issue — it clearly is not, as per the UN — then peace will be difficult to achieve. India’s foreign allies can play a major part in promoting peace by letting New Delhi know that the status quo in the occupied region is not okay, and that multi-stakeholder dialogue can lead to an end to the imbroglio. If India continues to be pampered and the Kashmiris’ plight ignored, peace in South Asia will remain a distant dream.",Newspaper

"Rival captains fear pink ball twilight collapse in Ahmedabad
","February 24, 2021","AHMEDABAD: England captain Joe Root and India skipper Virat Kohli have both warned of the challenges of playing during the twilight zone in day-night Tests — when batting collapses can happen — ahead of their third Test clash starting on Wednesday.
The match will be the first time that India and England — level at 1-1 in the four-match series — face each other in a day-night encounter.
“It’s much more challenging to play with the pink ball regardless of what pitch you are playing on,” Kohli said on the eve of the match in the world’s biggest cricket stadium in Ahmedabad.
“And especially in the evening, if, as a batting team, you are starting your innings under lights, then that one-and-a-half hour is challenging,” Kohli told reporters. “When it starts to get dark, especially during that twilight period, it gets very tricky. Light changes, it’s difficult to sight the ball and under lights is like playing the first session in the morning in a normal Test match. The ball tends to swing a lot.”
Both teams have had painful experiences of pink-ball cricket. India were bowled out for 36 by Australia in Adelaide in December and New Zealand skittled England in Auckland for 58 in 2018.
“Both are bizarre experiences for two quality sides,” Kohli said. “Barring that 45 minutes of bad cricket [in Adelaide] we dominated the Test match. We are very confident in how we play the pink ball.”
Root agreed that batsmen need to careful — and not just in the evening when the lights come on the ball can start swinging.
“I think there’s been a trend in all the pink-ball Test matches of collapses on occasion,” Root told a separate news conference. “It seems to be a trend and it’s something as a batting group you need to make sure you stop. It’s sometimes been right at the start of the game, you know the morning session, late on in day four, that this strange sort of passages of play has happened.”
He added: “When you get that opportunity and you’re on the right side of it, you’re in the field with a ball in hand, you really get and roll with it. You take every opportunity and chance and you make that really count in your favour.
“Similarly with a bat in hand, you’ve just got to really make sure those [first] 20 balls, you’re fighting with everything you’ve got to get yourself in, get accustomed to the wicket, the conditions and make sure you build that partnership which is so vital.”
The Ahmedabad stadium has a capacity of 110,000 people and authorities have allowed 55,000 tickets to go on sale each day.
Pace bowler Umesh Yadav has been added to India’s squad for the final two Tests in Ahmedabad after he passed a fitness test following his recovery from a calf injury.
An intense atmosphere is certain at the 110,000 capacity Sardar Patel stadium that was used for a rally by US president Donald Trump last February.
Authorities have said more than 50,000 tickets will go on sale for the first cricket game to be played in the revamped ground.
The pink ball, LED lights instead of usual floodlights and the size of the ground add to the test of nerves.
The hosts, who beat Bangladesh in under three days in their first day-night Test in Kolkata in 2019, are expected to stick largely to their winning side from Chennai.
England though will be forced to make changes because of their rotation policy. Moeen Ali headed back home after the second Test loss when he was England’s standout performer with eight wickets and a quickfire 43 with the bat.
Off-spinner Dom Bess is expected to get his place back and fast bowler James Anderson should return.
“I believe this series is absolutely on a knife-edge,” former England spinner Graeme Swann said. “It is a brilliant place for England to be, and they’ve got a great chance to go ahead once more. I’m full of optimism going into this game, mainly due to Jimmy coming back.
“He was irrepressible in the first match, and he just keeps defying the odds and gets better and better.” 
Returning batsman Jonny Bairstow and fast bowler Mark Wood will also be in contention, while Jofra Archer, who missed the second Test with an elbow problem, is expected to make the team.
“Always nice to be in competition for the squad,” said a fit-again Archer.
The England paceman said he was looking forward to playing on the new ‘beautiful’ ground in front of the crowd.
Each side has had a convincing win in the first two Tests. England won the first by 227 runs, while India claimed the second by 317 runs. Both need a win to keep alive their hopes of reaching the World Test Championship final.",Newspaper

"NA speaker seeks report from KP govt on trainers’ killing
","February 24, 2021","ISLAMABAD: National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser on Tuesday sought a report from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government within a week over the 
 in a terrorist attack in North Waziristan’s tribal district on Monday.
Terming it a serious incident, the speaker said he would direct the provincial chief secretary to present him the report within a week after the matter was raised by MNA from the same area Mohsin Dawar, who also wanted to talk about it during the assembly session on Monday, but could not do so due to a noisy protest from the treasury and opposition benches.
In a brazen daylight attack, masked terrorists on Monday shot dead four women vocational trainers and injured their driver near Mirali in North Waziristan tribal district. According to the police, the vehicle carrying five women was driving through Eppi village near Mirali when the gunmen opened fire on it, killing four of them on the spot. All the slain women belonged to nearby Bannu district. The driver of the vehicle suffered bullet injuries in the attack. The police statement said that one woman trainer survived as she took shelter in the village.
Mr Dawar said it was a real tragedy that four women workers of a non-governmental organisation (NGO) had been killed in the broad daylight and there had been no debate on the incident in parliament as well as the national media. “Yes, this is a serious issue. I will seek a report from the KP government. I direct the chief secretary to present the report in one week time,” ruled the speaker, following which Mr Dawar did not agitate.
After the incident, the police in a statement had declared the slain women as NGO workers, but later they changed their stance and said that the women had been working for a training institute.
Meanwhile, the speaker on Tuesday snubbed the protesting lawmakers belonging to the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) from Karachi when they once again started a noisy protest over the alleged attack on opposition leader in Sindh Haleem Adil Sheikh in a prison and suspended the proceedings as soon as the members from both sides of the aisle carrying placards started to gather in front of his dais.
Expressing his displeasure, the speaker said it was not appropriate for members of the government to create such a situation in the house. However, the PTI members ignored the speaker’s directive and continued their protest and in the meanwhile some of the opposition members, belonging to the Pakistan Peoples Party, also brought out their placards and banners and came near the speaker’s dais. “If the government members will do it then I will adjourn the house,” the speaker threatened, and then suspended the proceedings for 10 minutes.
When the house resumed its proceedings, Deputy Speaker Qasim Suri was in the chair. Sources said the protesting PTI members from Karachi had a meeting with the speaker in his chamber. In the meeting, the PTI MNAs received a snub from the speaker, who categorically told them that he would not give them the floor come what may. On Monday, the same members had disrupted the proceedings, forcing the speaker to adjourn the sitting.
The assembly passed three private members’ bills — the Islamabad Capital Territory Prohibition of Corporal Punishment Bill, 2020, the Islamabad Capital Territory Prohibition of Interest on Private Loans Bill, 2020, and the Al-Karam International Institute Bill, 2020.
Besides this, the members introduced six private members’ bills which were referred to the committees concerned.

"Withholding tax waived on sugar imports
","February 24, 2021","ISLAMABAD: The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) on Tuesday notified exemption of withholding tax on import of 500,000 tonnes of sugar.
The government has already exempted 17pc sales tax and 3pc minimum value-added tax on sugar import and its subsequent supply in domestic market.
This facility will only be available to the Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP). The TCP will import and subsequently supply sugar in the current season.

"Yamani, the author of Saudi oil power, dies at 90
","February 24, 2021","DUBAI: Saudi Arabia’s Sheikh Zaki Yamani, the embodiment of the ascent of Arab petroleum power and the face of the 1973 oil embargo that brought the West to its knees, died in London on Tuesday. He was 90.
Yamani was a witness to the 1975 assassination of King Faisal who had plucked him, a non-royal, from obscurity to be oil minister. Later the same year Yamani was kidnapped at an OPEC meeting by Ilyich Ramirez Sanchez, known as Carlos the Jackal.
Known for his elegant manner and trademark goatee beard, Sheikh Yamani’s 24-year tenure running the oil affairs of the world’s biggest crude producer made him a global celebrity during the inflationary “oil shocks” of the 1970s.
That ended with his abrupt sacking in 1986 after a costly attempt to prop up crude prices, a failed strategy which has cast a shadow over Saudi oil policy to this day.
In December 1975, Yamani attended the meeting of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna, which ended in a hail of bullets fired into the ceiling from Venezuelan assassin Carlos and five others. Three bystanders were killed.
Carlos, promoting the Palestinian cause, targeted Yamani as the most valuable hostage, telling him repeatedly that he had been sentenced to death. Ministers were held for two days in a dynamite-charged room before the captors were granted a plane out of Austria with their hostages.
A further 43 harrowing hours on board, flying from Algeria to Libya and back, created an intimacy between captive and hostage taker.
“It was odd, but as we sat together and talked, it was almost as if we had become friends,” Yamani told biographer Jeffrey Robinson. “He was telling me so much, knowing that I would die.”
A deal was struck in Algiers and Carlos vanished, escaping arrest until 1994. Serving a life sentence in a French jail, Carlos outlived Yamani.
Months earlier, Yamani was at the side of Saudi King Faisal in Riyadh, receiving a visiting delegation when a disaffected prince pulled out a revolver and shot the king dead.
Yamani’s career was remarkable, for the time, as a commoner in a society dominated by the royal family.
Born on June 30, 1930, the son of an Islamic scholar and judge in Makkah, Yamani was expected to follow his father and grandfather into teaching.
After studying law in Cairo he left for New York University and Harvard. Returning to Saudi Arabia, he set up a law firm and took on government work, drawing the attention of the future King Faisal. He became oil minister in 1962.
In 1973 the fourth Arab-Israeli conflict prompted Yamani to trigger an oil embargo. A four-fold increase in the price of crude marked the high point of OPEC power and sent western economies into recession as inflation soared in what became known as the first oil shock.
Sheikh Yamani summed up that moment when oil producers took charge. “The moment has come,” he said. “We are masters of our own commodity.”",Newspaper
"Pakistan to get 10m doses of vaccine under Covax
","March 3, 2021","GENEVA: Pakistan, Nigeria and Indonesia will be among the biggest recipients of free Covid-19 vaccines before June — more than 10 million doses each — the Covax scheme announced on Tuesday.
Some 238.2 million doses will be distributed around the world by the end of May, in a major acceleration of the programme aimed at boosting access to coronavirus jabs in poorer nations.
Though vaccination campaigns have gathered pace globally, the majority of injections have been administered in wealthier countries while many nations have yet to receive a single dose.
But the World Health Organisation (WHO) — a co-leader of the Covax programme — says providing vaccines to all countries is the only way out of the pandemic.
The Covax scheme, which is aimed at ensuring equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines, on Tuesday outlined delivery plans for hundreds of millions of doses.
The five biggest confirmed recipients are Pakistan (14,640,000), Nigeria (13,656,000), Indonesia (11,704,800), Bangladesh (10,908,000) and Brazil (9,122,400).
They are followed by Ethiopia (7,620,000), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (5,928,000), Mexico (5,532,000), Egypt (4,389,600) and Vietnam (4,176,000).
Iran, Myanmar, Kenya and Uganda are also in line for more than three million doses each.
Overall by the end of May, India is likely to be the biggest recipient of Covax doses, but its allocation was not finalised before Tuesday’s distribution list publication.
The Pacific island nation of Tuvalu is meanwhile set to receive the smallest number of doses at 4,800, followed by Nauru and Monaco with 7,200 each.
Covax is co-led by the WHO, the Gavi vaccine alliance, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.
“Our goal is to protect as many people as possible,” said Gavi chief executive Seth Berkley.
“Covax’s mission is to help end the acute phase of the pandemic as soon as possible.” The deliveries include some 237 million doses of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, being manufactured in India and South Korea, and another 1.2 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which requires special ultra-cold storage.
The scheme is aiming to distribute enough doses to vaccinate up to 27 per cent of the population in the 92 poorest participating economies by the end of the year.
Ghana, Ivory Coast, South Korea and Colombia have already received their first shipments of vaccines through Covax.
Nigeria, Angola, Cambodia and the DR Congo were all due to receive their first vaccine doses via Covax on Tuesday.
Most wealthy countries have procured their own vaccines, and so far some 260 million vaccine doses have been administered globally.",Pakistan

"‘Peanuts for Riverfront land’: farmers attack revenue team in Lahore
","March 3, 2021","LAHORE: A number of farmers attacked a revenue department team for announcing, what they say, meagre rates of their land being acquired for the mega Ravi Riverfront Urban Development Project. 
As farmers thrashed a patwari, other team members, led by the land acquisition collectors, fled and took cover in the quarters of Babakwala rest house, Kala Khatai Road of Ferozewala.  
“We reject the rate of Rs200,000 per acre located in the riverbed. The rates of the land other than the riverbed has been fixed Rs1.35 million per acre which is really nothing,” farmer Nazir Awan said.  
According to the land acquisition award, the government fixed Rs200,000 to Rs2.3 million per acre subject to location in the mauzas of Riyanagar Kalan, Chauhan, Dhanoiya, Shedowal, Babakwal, Jada, Qadiyan, Rasoolpur, Khairdinpur, Ayanagar Khurd, Nirapur, Ratanwal and Kachi Kotli. 
“We reject and oppose this land acquisition plan. We will see them (the government) how they get our precious land forcibly from us against cheaper rates,” he warned. 
He said the farmers had tried hard to convince the government to get their land at reasonable rates.  
“If the government wants to develop housing projects on our land, it must talk to us and give us market rates. It is so simple,” he said. 
The team, led by collectors Sajjad Qureshi and Zafar Jatial, was at the scene to announce the award (land acquisition, rates, area etc) under the land acquisition act. As soon as the officials started announcing the award, farmers exchanged words with the team, and some farmers started ransacking the chairs. A few of them slapped a patwari forcing the other members to leave the scene. 
Mazhar Abbas, a spokesperson for the farmers committee, said later the police intervened and controlled the situation. “The protesters also threw official files on the floor in protest,” he added. 
Talking to Dawn, Sheikhupura Deputy Commissioner Asghar Ali Joyia said they had got an FIR lodged against the farmers for manhandling the patwari.  
Mr Joyia was of the view that the impression being created by the farmers that the land was being acquired on cheaper rates was not based on facts. Under the schedule, the rate of the riverbed acre is Rs200,000. This type of land is considered barren land and not the cultivated one.  
“There are also some chunks of land for which the government is paying Rs5.5 million per acre. So how can we pay millions for the land falling in the riverbed?” he maintained. 
The DC said being the district collector his role was limited to give compensation of the farmers’ land as per scheduled government rates.  
“We can pay them better rates if the government announces a special package for the land acquisition,” he said.",Pakistan
"Senate poll amendment: Opp should have been consulted timely: Hamza
","March 3, 2021","LAHORE: Opposition Leader in Punjab Assembly Hamza Shehbaz has said the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government should have taken the opposition on board for bringing the constitutional amendment related to the Senate polls well in time. 
Talking to reporters here on Tuesday, Mr Hamza, who got released from jail after 20 months in a money-laundering case last week, chided the government for introducing a presidential ordinance on the Senate elections, which was rendered ineffective by the Supreme Court’s decision to hold the upper house poll through a secret ballot. 
“The government should have taken the opposition on board well in time on the legislation on the Senate polls, but it brought the ordinance,” he said and stressed that all stakeholders needed to sit together to steer the country out of the crises it was faced with. 
Interestingly, Hamza’s cousin and PML-N Vice President Maryam Nawaz has recently declared that the opposition won’t sit with the PTI government for any legislation, including that on the voting mode of the Senate polls, at any stage, as it did not consider the ruling setup in the country as a legitimate government.  
Hamza indirectly asked the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) as why it could not see the corruption in the BRT, Tsunami Tree and other such projects launched by the PTI government. Similarly, he pointed out there had been no progress in the foreign funding case against the PTI leadership. 
To a question about the opposition alliance Pakistan Democratic Movement’s candidate Yousuf Raza Gilani’s chances against the PTI’s Hafeez Shaikh in the Senate polls for Islamabad seat, he said the former premier was a good candidate and he would win the election. 
He also criticised the government for the unprecedented price hike and inflation in the country that made the lives of the masses miserable. 
Meanwhile, PML-N Punjab Information Secretary Azma Bokhari has asked the PTI lawmakers to listen to the voice of their conscience and not to vote for Hafeez Shaikh, terming him a candidate of the IMF.

"US imposes sanctions on Russians over Navalny
","March 3, 2021","WASHINGTON: The United States on Tuesday imposed sanctions on seven senior Russians as it said its intelligence concluded that Moscow was behind the poisoning of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.
In action coordinated with the EU, the United States renewed demands that Russia free Navalny, who was arrested in January upon his return to Moscow as he spurred massive rallies through his allegations of corruption by President Vladimir Putin.
“The intelligence community assesses with high confidence that officers of Russia’s Federal Security Service FSB used a nerve agent known as Novichok to poison Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny on August 20, 2020,” a senior US official said.
Officials said that the United States would impose sanctions on “seven senior members of the Russian government” with the details expected to be released later Tuesday.
They also said that the United States would restrict exports to Russia as it vowed that President Joe Biden would take a harder line than his predecessor Donald Trump, who voiced admiration for Putin.
“We’re sending a clear signal to Russia that there are clear consequences to the use of chemical weapons,” another official said.
Navalny, 44, fell violently ill when he was on a domestic flight.
He was rushed to treatment in Germany where doctors said he had been poisoned with Novichok, a nerve agent developed by Soviet researchers and which was also blamed in a 2018 attack in England against Russian double-agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter and Yulia.
In Kiev, European Council chief Charles Michel said on Tuesday the EU has no plans to lift punishing sanctions against Russia that were imposed over the conflict in Ukraine.
Ukraine has been fighting Russia-backed separatists in the eastern Donetsk and Lugansk regions following Moscow’s annexation of the Crimean peninsula in 2014.
Ukraine and its Western allies accuse Russia of sending troops and arms to support the separatists.
Michel, who on Tuesday began his two-day visit to Ukraine with a trip to the country’s war-torn east, said “Russia has not reciprocated Ukraine’s positive steps” to settle the conflict.
“That’s why our economic sanctions against Russia will remain in place,” he said in his address to the media, accompanied by Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky.
“Russia is a party to this conflict, and not a mediator,” Michel added.
He also reiterated Brussels’ support for Kiev, announcing the launch this year of a new programme to boost economic development and public services in war-scarred eastern areas.
“The people of Ukraine are not alone. We are on your side,” he said.
Michel’s visit comes during an increase in violence as eight Ukrainian servicemen have been killed since mid-February, shattering a ceasefire brokered last year.
The fierce fighting that erupted after Moscow’s takeover of Crimea has claimed more than 13,000 lives, according to the United Nations, but the number of new fatalities has been decreasing in recent years.
EU leaders in December extended until mid-2021 the sanctions that target whole sectors of the Russian economy including its valuable oil businesses.",Newspaper
"Iran warns against censure at UN nuclear watchdog’s meeting
","March 3, 2021","TEHRAN: Iran on Tuesday warned against a potential resolution at the UN nuclear watchdog condemning its suspension of some nuclear inspections, but stressed it remains committed to diplomacy.
Britain, France and Germany, the three European members of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, will put forward the resolution during this week’s meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency’s board of governors, according to diplomatic sources.
A document circulated by the Iranian mission in Vienna and seen by AFP said such a resolution would effectively end the temporary agreement that IAEA chief Rafael Grossi worked out with Tehran to mitigate what he calls the “huge loss” of some inspections.
“I have to give this warning, that actions against our expectations will have adverse effects on diplomatic processes, and can quickly close the windows of opportunity,” Iran’s government spokesman Ali Rabiei told reporters.
Iran expects “all parties to act rationally and prudently, and to know the value of fleeting moments,” he added. “We are still committed to diplomacy.” Restrictions on inspections went into force on February 23.
It followed a law passed by the Iranian parliament in December, that called for suspending certain commitments if the US does not lift unilateral sanctions or the three European countries do not help Tehran to bypass those sanctions.
Under the agreement with the IAEA, that runs for up to three months, data from cameras on Iran’s nuclear programme will be stored and not handed over to the agency, and if sanctions are not lifted by that time, Tehran will start erasing the recordings.
According to Rabiei, the agreement conveyed Iran’s “goodwill”, and now the Islamic republic expects other parties to the nuclear deal to “prove” theirs.
Diplomatic sources in Vienna say the European resolution is expected to face a vote on Friday, and that it is backed by the United States.
The 2015 landmark nuclear deal has been hanging by a thread since former US president Donald Trump withdrew Washington from it and reimposed punishing sanctions on Iran in 2018.
Current US President Joe Biden has signalled his readiness to revive the deal, but insists Iran first return to all its nuclear commitments, most of which it suspended in response to the sanctions.
Tehran demands Washington take the first step by scrapping the sanctions.
Iran on Sunday dismissed a European offer for an informal meeting involving the US on the deal, saying the time is not right as Washington has failed to lift sanctions.",Newspaper

 in the eastern city of Jalalabad, the latest assassinations to rack the war-weary country.
Journalists, activists and judges have recently been ambushed by gunmen or killed by explosives attached to their vehicles as surging violence forces many into hiding — with some leaving Afghanistan.
The killings have escalated since 
 last year between the Afghan government and the Taliban, sparking fears that the insurgents are eliminating perceived opponents.
The three women were shot and killed in two separate attacks after they left the 
 station where they worked on Tuesday.
An Islamic State affiliate later claimed responsibility for the murders, saying its gunmen carried out the killings of what it called “journalists working for one of the media stations loyal to the apostate Afghan government”. Friends and family gathered in Jalalabad to bury their loved ones as they pleaded for an end to the killings.
Mohammad Nazif said his cousin Sadia Sadat was just 18 years old when she was killed on Tuesday, and she had been working at the TV station over the past year to help support her family.
“Her family was very happy for her to work in TV. She had not received any warnings,” Nazif told 
.
“I don't know why the militants target such innocent girls. I ask them to stop the targeted killing of media workers.” A colleague at

","March 2, 2021","ISLAMABAD: Highlighting certain risks to fiscal sustainability, the federal government has reported its half-year (July-December) fiscal deficit at 3.1 per cent of GDP, or the highest-ever figure of Rs1.393 trillion in absolute terms.  
In its mid-year Budget Review Report submitted to the parliament as required under the Public Finance Act, 2019, the Ministry of Finance on Monday claimed credit for higher revenues, controlled expenditures amid fiscal consolidation measures but conceded that there were “certain risks to fiscal sustainability”.  
Going forward, the fiscal position would depend on the domestic and international evolution of the Covid-19 pandemic, the ministry said, adding that faster-than-anticipated economic revival was also likely to increase demand for inputs.  
During the first half of the current financial year, an amount of Rs116 billion was provided to combat the pandemic from the revalidated Economic Stimulus Package, including purchase of vaccines worth Rs25bn.  Moreover, Rs64bn was utilised under the Ehsaas Programme to provide relief to vulnerable segments of society.  
The finance ministry said the government had adopted a facilitative policy of releasing funds to meet the expenditures, both recurrent and development, in accordance with its spending priorities. Nevertheless, the half-year fiscal position indicates that factors will remain on track to meet the annual fiscal targets.  
The country’s overall fiscal deficit was, however, brought down by about Rs255bn cash surplus provided by the four provinces. The overall primary balance (excluding debt servicing and interest payments) was also reported at 0.7pc (surplus) against a full year deficit limit of 0.5pc. 
The report said the continuity in fiscal consolidation, stable exchange rate, improved current account and better financial management presented a promising economic outlook. The current account balance continued to improve, posting a surplus of $1.1bn (0.8pc of the GDP) during the first half of the year, it said. 
Tax collection grew by 5.6pc in first half on a Year-on-Year (YOY) basis despite an upsurge of Covid-19 and the Federal Board of Revenue achieved about 99pc of its half year target. Non-tax revenue remained at par with the previous year collection in spite of reduction in State Bank of Pakistan profits and non-realisation of fees from cellular license renewals. Current expenditure was controlled through austerity measures and strict financial discipline. 
The government said its borrowing operations remained in line with the Medium-Term Debt Management Strategy (MTDS FY20-23) and just like last year, domestic borrowing came entirely from the financial markets and about Rs285bn borrowing from the SBP was retired. Also, the borrowing to fund the fiscal deficit was made through longer-term debt, while short-term debt (T-bills) reduced by around Rs579bn. 
The major sources of non-tax revenue for the federal government during this period are surplus profit of the SBP and Petroleum Levy which showed more than 110pc growth. As such, the government achieved 54pc of budgeted targets despite the adverse impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on economic activity. 
The ministry said the expenditure on running of civil government was reduced to 40pc of the allocation by restricting supplementary grants and implementing austerity measures. Additional funds have only been approved as a supplementary grant which remained unutilised under the Economic Stimulus Package of last financial year to extend the relief measures. 
All additional needs of the ministries and divisions had been met through Technical Supplementary Grants from within the allocated budget, with primary reliance on re-appropriation of funds. 
The Rs1.475tr worth major chunk of current expenditure was spent on debt servicing, out of which, domestic interest payments amounted to Rs1.357tr and external interest payments amounted to Rs118bn. 
The ministry also reported that Rs232bn had been utilised against the Public Sector Development Programme’s allocation of Rs650 billion up to December last year.",Newspaper
"Sanjrani offers four Senate seats to PDM from Balochistan
","March 2, 2021","QUETTA: Senate chairman Sadiq Sanjrani has offered four seats to leaders of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) for unopposed election of its candidates in the Senate election from Balochistan.
Mr Sanjrani is nowadays in Quetta drumming up support for candidates of the ruling Balochistan Awami Party and its allies to ensure their success in the Senate election.
He held a meeting with JUI-F secretary general and some other opposition leaders on Monday and offered them four out of the 12 Senate seats from Balochistan.
The sources said that Mr Sanjrani told the opposition leaders that the government was ready to give two general seats and one seat reserved for a technocrat and one for a woman to the opposition parties.
PDM leaders Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haideri, Sardar Akhtar Mengal and Mehmood Khan Achakzai confirmed at a press conference that Mr Sanjrani had made such an offer, but said their alliance had rejected it. They said they were ready to hold further talks if the government agreed to give PDM 50 per cent of the Senate seats from Balochistan.
“If the government is ready to offer six out of 12 Senate seats then opposition is ready for unopposed election of candidates in Senate election from Balochistan,” the PDM leaders said.
They said that the PDM alliance could easily win five Senate seats in the election on March 3 and efforts were under way for winning more seats.
BNP-Mengal President Sardar Akhtar Mengal said that the PDM had asked the Senate chairman that he should reply to the opposition after discussing the matter with Chief Minister Jam Kamal Khan Alyani.
“We have given the mandate to Maulana Haideri in this regard and Mr Sanjrani should inform him about the government’s response on the PDM’s demand,” Mr Mengal said.
He said the PDM was making good progress and it would not abandon its programme announced against the government in Islamabad.
“We are fielding joint candidates of the PDM and are hopeful of our success in the Senate election as in Balochistan lawmakers of other parties would cast their votes on the voice of their conscience,” Mr Mengal said.
Maulana Haideri said that PDM had contested the bye-election jointly and won the seats with a thumping majority and now “we are also contesting Senate elections jointly”. He said the PDM’s long march would be held according to the programme on March 26.
Mr Mehmood Khan Achakzai said the PDM had been formed for upholding the supremacy of parliament, constitution and democracy in the country. “We want the vote to be given respect,” he said.",Pakistan
"Data on royalty paid by firm running Saindak project sought
","March 2, 2021","QUETTA: The special committee of the Balochistan Assembly on Saindak project at its first meeting held on Monday asked the departments concerned to submit reports about royalty so far paid to the provincial government by the Chinese company.
The committee had been formed two years ago by Speaker Mir Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo when MPA Sanaullah Baloch had moved a resolution in the Balochistan Assembly demanding handing over of the Saindak project to the Balochistan government as after the passage of the 18th Constitution Amendment by the parliament it had become a provincial subject.
Chinese Company MCC Resources Development Company Limited (MRDL) took over the Saindak project in Chagai district in 2002 and it has been running the project since then.

"US destroyer docks in Sudan for first time in 30 years
","March 2, 2021","			
PORT SUDAN: A US naval destroyer docked on Sudan’s Red Sea coast on Monday in the latest sign of thawing relations between Washington and Khartoum, a day after a visit by a Russian frigate.
The visits are a sign of international competition for influence in Sudan, which sits in a volatile region bridging the Horn of Africa, the Gulf, and North Africa, following the 2019 overthrow of long-time ruler Omar al Bashir.
Some 300 marines standing at attention aboard the USS Winston Churchill were greeted by a Sudanese military band in Port Sudan, a strategically important city on the Red Sea that serves as the country’s main port.
Russia plans to set up a naval base capable of mooring nuclear-powered surface vessels, and on Sunday the Admiral Grigorovich frigate became the first Russian warship to enter the port. Before Bashir’s overthrow, both Qatar and Turkey had signed deals to restore the nearby Red Sea port of Suakin.
The United States and Sudan have started to rebuild political and economic ties, and late last year Washington removed Sudan from a list of state sponsors of terror. Under Bashir, Sudan was accused of harbouring militant groups.
“The reason I’m here is because I want to learn more about your country and develop partnerships with your navy,” said Rear Admiral Michael Baze, director of maritime affairs for the US Navy’s Sixth Fleet.
The visit came “after a break of more than 30 years and is considered a visit with great significance and is a return to the American-Sudanese relations in the framework of visits of warships”, said Colonel Ibrahim Hammad, fleet commander for the Port Sudan naval base.
In late January, officials from the US Africa Command visited Sudan and discussed “opportunities for future military to military engagements” with Sudanese officials, a US statement said.
Sudanese officials will tour the ship and “explore opportunities to work together and establish a basis for a relationship committed to security and stability” with US counterparts, read a statement.",Newspaper
"First UAE envoy to Israel takes up post
","March 2, 2021","JERUSALEM: Israel’s president on Monday formally received the first-ever ambassador from the United Arab Emirates to the Jewish state, following last year’s agreement between the countries to normalise ties.
Mohamed Al Khaja, the UAE envoy, arrived in Israel on Monday, delivered his credentials to Israeli President Reuven Rivlin at a ceremony in Jerusalem.
After greeting Khaja in Arabic, Rivlin said “The entire Israeli people welcomes you with joy.
“This will be your most important mission — to welcome the hands reaching out to you... treaties are signed by leaders, but real, sustained peace is made between peoples, face to face,” the president said.
Khaja said he would “work tirelessly to strengthen the political ties between our two countries, in the service of our peoples and regional stability.”
The UAE was the first country to agree to establish full diplomatic relations with the Jewish state under the Abraham Accords, a pact brokered by former US president Donald Trump.
The agreement made the UAE only the third majority Arab nation to form official ties with Israel, following Egypt in 1979 and Jordan in 1994.
Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan have subsequently joined the Abraham Accords.
The Palestinians have condemned the normalisation deals with Israel, describing them as treason.
Hamas, which controls the coastal Palestinian enclave of Gaza, on Monday slammed Khaja’s arrival in Israel, calling it a “national sin” on the part of the United Arab Emirates.
“Normalisation will always encourage the Israeli occupation to deny our Palestinian people’s rights and to continue its crimes against all segments of the Arab world,” it said in a statement.",Newspaper
"Bird flu threat looms amid weak disease surveillance by govt
","March 2, 2021","KARACHI: Although Pakistan has not reported any case of bird flu yet despite facing serious threat from regional countries, it is time that the provincial governments, particularly that of Sindh and Balochistan, help poultry farmers, improve disease surveillance, allocate budget for research and formulate the much-awaited bylaws for the poultry sector.
These views were shared by poultry farmers and experts 
 spoke to over the looming threat of bird flu that has affected neighbouring countries, including India and Iran, where recently 1.4 million poultry birds were culled to contain the spread of severe bird flu, known as H5N8.
“The bird flu threat is serious though we haven’t received any report of a case yet. The only way we can minimise the risk is by strengthening coordination with farmers, upgrading surveillance and testing capacity and improving provincial coordination with the National Reference Laboratory for Poultry Diseases located in Islamabad,” said a lab official on the condition of anonymity.
The laboratory, part of the National Agricultural Research Centre, was well equipped to carry out any kind of poultry disease tests, he added.
Asked about the effectiveness of provincial coordination, he conceded that it was more effective before the enactment of the 18th Constitutional Amendment.
Speaking to 
, commercial poultry farmers based in different districts of Sindh stated that the government’s role nowhere existed in poultry production as they took care of all their inputs and no government official ever inspected their premises for disease surveillance and support.
“I have been in this business for a long time and never heard of free vaccines or disease surveillance by any government department,” said Haji Idrees, running controlled shed poultry farming in Dadu, adding that he knew well how to take care of poultry birds when they catch the infection.
Expressing similar views, Sarfaraz Junejo running a business in Mirpurkhas, said while he heard of a poultry research institute in Korangi, Karachi, he never sought its help and always relied on private labs and vets.
“That’s because we need immediate action and support. The government, if serious, should set up poultry disease diagnostic laboratories in each district,” he said, adding that one could imagine what would be the state in other districts located far away from Karachi.
Mr Junejo also once thought of exporting poultry to the UAE but couldn’t do so.
“I came to know that exporters needed to have certain certifications to get into this business, which don’t exist here.”
Replying to the concerns raised by farmers, Dr Rashid Farooq, the focal person for poultry diseases in Sindh, said the main focus of the government was prevention and that vaccines, medicines and diagnostic support were provided free only to those small/backyard poultry farmers who raised 5,000 to 6,000 birds.
“Currently, poultry disease diagnostic labs are functional in Sukkur, Hyderabad and Karachi. Tests are carried out either when we receive a poultry sample from a farmer or our team collects it during inspection in a market,” he said.
Asked whether government officials had the authority to inspect a private farm, he replied in the negative.
“Right now, disease surveillance is solely dependent on farmers’ cooperation as officials have no lawful authority to inspect any private premises. This power will come through bylaws preparation which is in process right now.”
He, however, emphasised that farmers were very sensitive about any loss they might suffer due to the disease and inform the government and seek its support if a need arose.
According to sources, financial constraints are a major factor hampering disease surveillance efforts as there is no budget allocation for research. Besides, the departmental staff hardly received funds for important operational expenditures without which it’s not possible to carry out disease surveillance. ",Pakistan
"Monitoring of secondary hospitals to improve patient care
","March 2, 2021","PESHAWAR: The health department is starting monitoring of the quality of services provided to patients at secondary healthcare facilities in the province.
“The performance of the tehsil and district level will be judged on the basis of the standard of services provided to the patients. The exercise is aimed at improving services,” officials told this scribe.
They said that so far, the independent monitoring unit (IMU) of the health department was monitoring the hospitals with emphasis on primary healthcare facilities.
Officials said that IMU briefed the director-general health services through presentations to on monthly basis regarding the performance of primary healthcare facilities with little mention of secondary services.
They said that the keep performance indicators (KPIs) were re-notified with emphasis on coverage of health facilities on the basis of outputs as opposed to previous practices when it recorded inputs, such as presence and availability of human resources, medicines, diagnostics, equipments, building etc.
“Now, IMU has been tasked to comprehensively report on the performance of secondary level health services in different districts,” they said. They added that work was completed and training of staff was underway prior to piloting Peshawar district for initial implementation of the output-based KPIs.
“There will be regular monitoring of secondary healthcare facilities by inspectors, who will talk to patients to know about their level of satisfaction from services. There will be frequent visits by IMU staffers to the hospitals,” said officials.
They said that government wanted to utilise the vast health infrastructure with 50,000 employees for strengthening the secondary healthcare services to benefit the people in their native districts and reduce burden on the tertiary care hospitals that were supposed to receive chronically-ill people.
There are 2,612 healthcare facilities in the province including 1,504 in settled and 1,103 in tribal districts but patients directly visit the tertiary hospitals for the ailments, which are manageable in secondary hospitals.
Officials said that the hospitals including A, B, C and D categories were secondary care facilities that played significant role in patient care when they performed well. 
They said that most of those hospitals had specialised services and equipment. They added that the KPIs would help them to know the gaps in services.
“During the visits, monitors would report about the patients’ confidence and standard of diagnostic and clinical aspects. The exercise, to be replicated in the whole province very soon, is meant to strengthen secondary healthcare facilities for the local people,” said officials.
They said that through a mechanism, IMU would concentrate on waste management, infection control measures and treatment of patients. 
They added that IMU would continue to monitor primary healthcare facilities along with secondary care hospitals.
Also, it will be seen if some facilities have low admission and OPD rate. Such hospitals will be pointed and the department will take corrective measures. 
The under-utilised health outlets or those situated away from the population would be identified along with recommendations.
“The component of quality has been added to the IMU’s criteria for monitoring the hospitals. Now, a proper framework has been made with revised KPIs to strengthen secondary healthcare services,” said officials.",Pakistan
"Occupied Kashmir officials begin rounding up Rohingya refugees
","March 8, 2021","SRINAGAR: Authorities in Occupied Kashmir have sent at least 168 Rohingya refugees to a holding centre, police said on Sunday, in a process they say is meant for the deportation of thousands of the refugees living in the disputed region.
The move began on Saturday following a directive from the disputed region’s home department to identify Rohingya living in the southern city of Jammu, said Inspector-General Mukesh Singh.
He said around 5,000 Rohingya Muslims had taken refuge in Jammu in the past few years.
“All of them are illegally living here and we have begun identifying them,” Singh said. “This process is to finally deport them to their country.”
More than one million Rohingya people have fled waves of violent persecution in their native Myanmar and are currently mainly living in overcrowded, squalid refugee camps in Bangladesh.
Since Saturday, officials have called hundreds of Rohingya to a stadium in Jammu, taking their personal details and biometrics and testing them for the novel coronavirus. A jail had been converted into a holding centre on the outskirts of the city, and at least 168 Rohingya had so far been sent there, Singh said.
The refugees, who have previously faced hostility in the city, were not informed of what was going on. Jammu is a Hindu-dominated area in the Muslim-majority Occupied Kashmir region.
Khatija, a Rohingya Muslim woman who uses one name, said the Indian authorities took away her son on Saturday and she didn’t know where he was being kept. Her daughter-in-law gave birth on Sunday morning, she added.
An estimated 40,000 Rohingya people have taken refuge in parts of India and Occupied Kashmir. Fewer than 15,000 are registered with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Many have settled in areas with large Muslim populations, including the southern city of Hyderabad and New Delhi. Some have taken refuge in northeast India bordering Bangladesh and Myanmar.
The Indian government claims it has evidence there are extremists who pose a threat to the country’s security among the Rohingya and calls all of them illegal immigrants who will be deported.
In 2018 and 2019, Indian authorities deported at least 12 Rohingya in two groups to Myanmar. Rights groups have asked the Indian government to abandon plans for deporting Rohingya and evaluate their asylum claims.",Newspaper
"SOEs continue bleeding money
","March 8, 2021","In yet another step towards the formal revival of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan programme, the government is set to introduce in parliament a fresh bill for the restructuring, liquidation and privatisation of state-owned entities (SOEs). 
The government has finalised the draft SOE Bill with the close coordination of the IMF, Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank to ensure better management of the SOE portfolio.
As part of the process, the government last week finalised a triage of 84 out of a total of 212 SOEs that would be prepared in the first phase of restructuring for ultimate privatisation, liquidation or retention in the public sector to meet a structural benchmark of the IMF.
The overall revenues of all these 84 SOEs in 2018-19 amounted to about Rs4 trillion while the book value of their assets stood at Rs19tr. The revenues in 2018-19 were roughly 10 per cent of nominal GDP, providing employment to more than 450,000 people (0.8pc of the total workforce), according to the Ministry of Finance.
The proposed law will introduce structured governance reforms in the management and oversight of the SOEs. Through this proposed legislation, the boards of directors of the SOEs will be given more autonomy in terms of decision-making in addition to ensuring the separation of the office of chairman from that of the CEO in all SOEs, including entities established through special enactments. Moreover, the role of the line ministries and divisions will be streamlined for operational autonomy of the SOEs.
Even before the legislation, the Ministry of Finance has initiated steps for the establishment of a Central Monitoring Unit (CMU) within the Ministry of Finance, which will function as the central database and analytical unit for all the SOEs and will report directly to the federal government through the finance minister. The unit will be staffed with experts to be hired from the market and necessary resources for its working will be provided. 
The CMU will have access to necessary financial and non-financial information of each SOE and the business plans and target performance outcomes. The unit will prepare periodical performance evaluation reports of the SOEs and assist the federal government on matters of critical importance for better management of SOEs and their improved performance.
The Ministry of Finance has already started working on an SOE Ownership and Management Policy with technical support from the ADB and the IMF. So far, no policy framework exists in Pakistan that covers the entire SOE portfolio. This appears to be a departure from the previous concept of an umbrella organisation (Sarmaya Pakistan) given the fact the various SOEs had their peculiar challenges and solutions and could not be addressed through a one-size-fits-all solution.
To address the current policy gap and the diversity of sectors and legal and institutional frameworks in which the SOEs operate, the government now intends to develop a policy to manage these SOEs through a coherent and institutionalised arrangement. The clarity on the ownership rationale of SOEs, the role of the federal government as shareholder and the manner of the exercise of the ownership function, the respective roles and responsibilities of the federal government, line ministries and the boards of SOEs, frameworks of competitive neutrality and public-sector obligation, and necessary reporting and decision-making processes will be important components of the proposed policy.
There are 14 entities that are planned to be retained under government ownership but require immediate reforms and possible restructuring. Among them are Pakistan Railways and Pakistan Inter­national Airlines, which were collectively making a loss of Rs88 billion in FY2018-19. They are already under an active restructuring and reform process.
The finance ministry said these were not performing core functions as covered in the Public Policy Framework and, therefore, are recommended for privatisation or liquidation. There are 10 SOEs, which are already on an active privatisation list and are at various stages of the privatisation process. About 34 more entities will be gradually added to the list but none of them may reach the sale counter during the term of the current government and may be ready by June 2023 to 2025.
Pakistan Steel Mills is an important entity on the active list and is at an advanced stage of the privatisation process. SME Bank is another loss-making SOE, which is on the active privatisation list. In addition to these, partial divestment of Oil and Gas Development Company and Pakistan Petroleum is also underway.
The Ministry of Finance has reported to the cabinet and the IMF that a total of 25 SOEs, which earned cumulative profits of Rs107bn in 2018-19, would be retained by the government for supplying goods and services, serving national or economic interest, set up under G2G arrangement, essential infrastructure services requiring large investments, national food security, national defence or security etc.
Another 14 companies are also retained in the public sector and will be restructured. There are about 10 other companies that have been described as potential candidates for privatisation while one entity — Industrial Development Bank Limited — is currently under liquidation.
The ministry said that four companies having total profitability of Rs51.4bn in 2018-19 were financially viable and would be retained in government hands. These include Government Holding Ltd (Rs34bn profit), Pak Arab Refinery (Rs12.3bn), Pak-Kuwait Investment (Rs4.7bn) and Pakistan Revenue Automation (Rs146 million).
The ministry said that despite their important role in providing essential public goods and services, the financial performance of several SOEs had remained unsatisfactory. In 2018-19, these 84 commercial SOEs collectively recorded net losses of Rs143bn, down from Rs287bn in 2017-18. The improvement in SOEs performance was driven by government policies, including robust business growth in local upstream oil and gas markets translating into significant gains for oil and gas companies, and policy reforms and operational improvements in the power sector leading to timely tariff notifications.
Over the past six years, one-third of the commercial SOEs experienced losses intermittently. Moreover, the sum of the losses of top-10 loss-making SOEs contributed around 90pc to the total losses of SOE portfolio each year. National High­ways Autho­­­rity, Pakistan Railways, PIA and power-sector distribution companies had been among the top 10 loss-making SOEs.
Among the SOEs performing core functions, 25 SOEs were profitable in 2018-19. Another 19 entities had been consistently profit-making during the last three years — 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19 — however, their returns on assets had been lower than the threshold. Two more SOEs — Central Power Purchasing Agency and Pak-Iran Investment Company — have positive equity and were profitable in 2016-17 and 2018-19. ",Newspaper
"IPL returns to India without spectators initially
","March 8, 2021","NEW DELHI: The popular Indian Premier League (IPL) will begin in Chennai on April 9 and will be played across six venues, initially without spectators, the Indian cricket board said on Sunday.
The world’s richest Twenty20 competition was shifted to the United Arab Emirates last year as India grappled with the Covid-19 pandemic.
Sunday’s IPL governing council meeting decided to bring the tournament home but the pandemic forced several changes to how it would be played.
“The IPL this year at home will be played behind closed doors to begin with and a call on allowing spectators will be taken at a later stage of the tournament,” Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary Jay Shah said in a statement.
Ahmedabad’s Narendra Modi Stadium will host the playoffs as well as the May 30 final, with Bengaluru, Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata being the other venues.
Defending champions Mumbai Indians will take on Royal Challengers Bangalore, led by India captain Virat Kohli, in the first match.
The tournament’s eight teams will play all their matches at neutral venues.
“The fixtures of the tournament have been mapped in a way that every team will travel only three times during the league stage, thus reducing commute and minimising risk,” Shah said. “After hosting the tournament safely and successfully in the UAE last year ... the BCCI is confident of hosting the IPL at home with health and safety of players and all people involved being paramount.”

"Kamal berates MQM-P for backing PM in trust move without getting census issue resolved
","March 8, 2021","KARACHI: Pak Sarzameen Party chairman Syed Mustafa Kamal has condemned the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan for giving the vote of confidence to Prime Minister Imran Khan without getting reversed the government’s decision to accept the controversial census. He said people of Karachi would hold them accountable for betraying Karachiites.
He also alleged that the MQM-P representatives gave the trust vote to the PM in exchange of their “perks and privileges”.
On Saturday, PM Khan took the vote of confidence from MNAs belonging to his party, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, and its coalition partners in the National Assembly. A total of 178 MNAs reposed trust in the PM’s leadership and the support of seven MQM MNAs was crucial as without them he would have lost majority in the house.
After the trust vote, MQM-P convener Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui made a speech in the house in which he asked the prime minister to fulfil his promises to his party, include it in decision-making process and take action to recover nearly 100 “missing” workers. However, he did not mention anything about the census despite the fact that his party’s representative in the cabinet wrote a dissenting note when the federal cabinet accepted the census results in December.
Criticising the MQM-P for what he called failing to act on the genuine grievances of Karachi, PSP chief Kamal said that if the MQM-P was really sincere with the people of Karachi, it would have raised the issue of the controversial census and demanded a five per cent audit of census blocks in Karachi to ascertain the real population of the metropolis before giving the trust vote to the PM.
Speaking to PSP workers via social media, he said the people of Karachi would have been grateful if the “so-called representatives of the city” had managed to get reversed the federal cabinet’s decision to approve the controversial census of Karachi and ensured a fresh, transparent and correct population count.
But, instead, they made demands of “portfolios, perks and privileges and opening of party offices”, he claimed, adding that it was tragic that the elected representatives from Karachi in the National Assembly and the Senate were taking “anti-Karachi” steps for their personal interests at the cost of public interests.
“Now the people of Karachi should understand who is exploiting their votes. Karachiites must hold accountable all their elected representatives, including the federal and provincial governments,” he said.
He added that the PSP got a comprehensive strategy for resolving all issues of the country from Karachi to Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan. “The real democracy will prevail when institutions are strengthened by devolution of powers and resources at the grassroots level,” he added.",Pakistan
"Overstressed LNG chain is a safety hazard, says report
","March 8, 2021","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s liquefied natural gas terminals are overstressed and LNG value chain is very fragile from all parameters against global standards and could face operational and safety risks, contrary to common perception in public discourse that terminals are underutilised.
“Even with the low ratios of ‘re-gas to storage’ and ‘LNG import capacity to storage’, the overall utilisation rate of LNG terminals across the globe is approximately 43 per cent. Pakistan’s utilisation is at a remarkable 84pc despite having extremely inflexible infrastructure and other constraints,” Pakistan LNG Limited (PLL) and Pakistan LNG Terminal Limited (PLTL) said in a joint report to the government.
“Operating Terminal-1 [of Engro Elengy] at nearing 100pc utilisation rate leaves very little flexibility to handle shocks,” the report said, adding that when compared with the global and European averages, “it is realised that Pakistan’s utilisation rates are 249pc and 196pc, respectively”.
Moreover, when Pakistan’s LNG import infrastructure is compared with the countries which solely rely on floating storage and re-gasification units (FSRUs), the country’s utilisation rate is 30pc higher than that of Kuwait and a striking 200pc higher than Argentina.
The comparison is based on FSRU capacity utilisation of nine countries. Pakistan is only next to Argentina and Kuwait in terms of throughput to storage ratios and with difference of less than 1pc. The only country which has an active third party access (TPA) regime is Lithuania which has the lowest throughput to storage ratios among all these countries.
Lithuania’s utilisation rate had been in the range of 20-30pc for many years and the country had the flexibility of implementing the TPA regime through which it achieved the historic highest utilisation rate of 45pc which is even around half than that of Pakistan’s 99pc at Terminal-1 and 71pc at Terminal-2 [of Pakistan Gasport Ltd].
Based on these global comparisons, PLTL and PLL have concluded that Pakistan is utilising its available LNG infrastructure in an efficient manner. “Instead of further stretching the limited available flexibility, Pakistan needs to optimise the usage of existing terminals by shifting LNG supplies from Terimnal-1 (99pc utilisation rate) to Terminal-2 (71pc utilisation rate),” the report suggested.
It noted that Pakistan has a very high throughput (re-gasification capacity) per unit of LNG volume storage capacity when compared with leading global LNG markets, including Japan, India, China and Europe.
Also, Pakistan’s total current re-gasification capacity of both terminals is about 1,440mmcfd (million cubic feet per day) with a very limited storage of only 317,000 cubic meters. “If global averages of capacities are used as a benchmark, Pakistan’s re-gasification capacity should have been only 550mmcfd with an LNG import capacity of 4.2 million tonnes per annum,” the report said, adding that even using the European benchmark being the highest among the dataset available, Pakistan capacity should have been only 700mmcfd and 5.25 million tonnes per annum.
But that’s not all. The report said the port infrastructure and gas pipeline constraints were also very serious. These constraints suggest that it is practically impossible to operate terminals near maximum throughput capacity. This “may lead to substantial disruptions in the entire supply chain, besides attracting significant and recurring cost implications, impact of which will be humungous as compared with the anticipated benefit”, it said.
It has been highlighted that restrictions by the Port Qasim Authority (PQA) on handling more than one LNG vessel in a day and unavailability of night navigation mean that Pakistan State Oil is importing around 73 LNG cargoes in a year, resulting in arrival of one cargo at Terminal-1 every five days and that at Terminal-2 every six days in the current scenario (66 slots) and four days in future (82 slots).
This means that in the current scenario, every 30th day cargoes will be arriving at both terminals, resulting in a delay of one day for berthing at one of the terminals and such an instance will happen at least 12 times in a year, resulting in a reduction in available berthing slots by two or three in a year. The remaining available berthing slots will be 63 or 64.
With future expansion, the frequency of clash in cargo arrival schedule will further increase to every 20h day. This is based on assumptions that there are no adverse weather conditions being experienced on the berthing days, all vessels arrive on the scheduled berthing date without a delay, no impact of fluctuation of demand on cargo scheduling and favorable tides are available on all days.
However, the past experience suggests that the PQA will not be able to handle LNG cargoes on an average of around 10 days in a year due to unfavorable tides and delivery dates of at least 65pc of PLL’s cargoes needed to be adjusted in accordance with the varying demand.
Moreover, owing to the constraints of pipeline capacity, Terminal-2 is generally forced to operate at significantly less than 600mmcfd for most part of the year.
This results in further restriction of berthing slots.",Newspaper
"Bilawal fails to win PML-Q support for Gilani
","March 8, 2021","LAHORE: The Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid (PML-Q) has expressed its inability to vote for the opposition Pakistan Democratic Movement’s candidate, Yousuf Raza Gilani, in the upcoming election for Senate chairman.
The PML-Q could not go against their coalition partner, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), said the federal Minister for Housing Tariq Bashir Cheema whose party had also remained an ally of the Pakistan Peoples Party when the latter had been in power during 2008-13.
It emerged during a meeting of PML-Q leaders Chaudhry Shujaat Husain and Pervez Elahi with PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari who also separately met PML-Nawaz (PML-N) Punjab president Hamza Shehbaz here on Sunday in an apparent move to open a new front against the ruling PTI.
In both meetings, possible options for replacing the Buzdar government in Punjab and cooperation in the March 12 election for Senate chairman were discussed, as the PDM is trying to win over the PTI allies for weakening the ruling party’s base both in Punjab and at the Centre, according to sources privy to the development.
They said the PPP chairman attempted to convince the PML-N leadership for an in-house change in Punjab even if the slot of the provincial chief executive is to be offered to any coalition partner of the incumbent government.
Mr Shehbaz, it was claimed, agreed to discuss the option in the PDM summit scheduled to be held in Islamabad on Monday (today).
The PPP chairman claimed to have visited the Chaudhrys to seek vote for the PDM candidate for Senate chairmanship, but he also tested PML-Q’s willingness to play a role in the replacement of the Punjab government, the sources said.
Former prime minister and Senator-elect Yousuf Raza Gilani and Qamar Zaman Kaira, besides other party leaders, accompanied the chairman during both the meetings.
Earlier at a joint media talk along with Mr Shehbaz in Model Town, Mr Bhutto-Zardari said the vote of confidence exposed the ‘internal fears’ of the prime minister. He said it also showed the President of Pakistan believed Mr Khan had lost majority in the National Assembly after the Senate election.
He said the PDM had proved its victory not only in Senate elections but also in the by-polls across the country, providing evidence that both the parliament and the masses were with the opposition.
The PPP chairman demanded a probe into the count of people present in the House at the time of a vote of confidence, as one of the opposition MNAs in attendance asserted that the number of parliamentarians during the process was less than what the NA speaker declared.
He told a questioner about the option of going for no-confidence motions against the PTI governments both in the Centre and in Punjab. But, he added, they had learnt a lot from the Senate election and the PDM would decide when and in which House to table a no-confidence motion against the ruling party.
He said they would do politics both on road and in parliament as the elected houses could not be left open to the ruling party.
The PPP chairman said they neither had guns nor support of the undemocratic forces but the backing of the public and parliament to counter the ‘puppet’ government.
Replying to a question about the proposed long march of the PDM and other steps against the PTI government, Mr Bhutto-Zardari said the opposition alliance leadership would announce decisions and strategies in this regard.",Pakistan
"Balochistan reports 47 incidents of violence against women in 2020
","March 8, 2021","QUETTA: As many as 47 incidents of violence against women were reported in Balochistan during 2020. In these incidents, 16 women lost their lives and seven were subjected to rape.
Director, Aurat Foundation, Balochistan, Alauddin Khilji, and member of the National Commission for Women, Balochistan, Fatima Khan, disclosed this while speaking at a joint press conference here on Sunday.
They said 33 incidents of violence against women were reported in just four districts of the province — Quetta, Sibi, Turbat and Gwadar.
They said the investigation report for 2020 revealed that overall 2,297 incidents of different natures, including human rights violation, murders, women harassment, were reported in 25 districts of the province.
“The incidents during the coronavirus pandemic were reported in a very limited number,” Fatima Khan said, adding that the number of such incidents was still alarmingly high.
She said a monthly review concluded that the number of such cases were very high in July during the peak of the Covid-19 outbreak and subsequently decreased.
Alauddin Khilji said 47 incidents of violence against women were reported in four districts of Balochistan — 29 from Quetta, 13 from Sibi, three from Turbat and two from Gwadar.
He said 16 women were killed and seven were raped in the province during 2020. “One woman committed suicide, two were killed in the name of honour and 13 were abducted,” he added.
“In the last two months, 10 people were killed in the name of honour in five reported incidents in Balochistan.”
He said every year on March 8 the International Women’s Day was observed across the world to show solidarity with women who were fighting for their rights. On this day, women all over the world should unite and raise their voice for their rights and governments should also pay attention to women’s issues, he added.
Mr Khilji said that the importance of International Women’s Day in Pakistan was significant due to miserable condition of a gender with over 50 per cent population.
“The Pakistani women’s movement has played an important role in raising awareness about women’s issues,” Fatima Khan said. Women’s Front, Aurat March, APWA and other social organisations were fighting for women’s rights, she added.
She said Aurat Foundation has released an investigation report on incidents of violence against women and girls in Pakistan reported from January to December 2020.
Alauddin Khilji said there was no chairperson for the National Commission for Women in Pakistan. “No member or chairperson for the Punjab Commission for Women has been appointed. The Balochistan Commission for Women is yet to be formed.”
In 2013, a law was passed to appoint an ombudsman, but to date it had not been implemented, he added.
Meanwhile, Balochistan Chief Minister Jam Kamal Khan Alyani paid tribute to women, saying that female health workers played a very important role in the fight against coronavirus.
He said the theme of the International Women’s Day in Pakistan this year is “Women Leaders Striving for an Equal Future in a Covid-19 World”.
According to him, the nation has come a long way in tackling this pandemic and women of the country have played a key role in this journey.
The chief minister said the present government had taken a number of steps to ensure gender equality in the country and women’s participation in all spheres. The provincial government was committed to provide equal opportunities to women and ensure the advancement of women through policy reforms, he added.
No country could achieve its development goals without participation of women in economic activities, he said, adding that and the present government was taking steps to make full use of women’s potential in all walks of life.",Pakistan
"China’s exports spike to highest in two decades
","March 8, 2021","BEIJING: China’s export growth jumped to the highest in over two decades, official data showed on Sunday, with imports also surging in a sharp bounceback from the coronavirus outbreak that had brought activity to a near halt.
Electronics and textile exports such as masks contributed to the spike in outbound shipments, as demand for work-from-home supplies and protective gear against the virus outbreak soared during the pandemic.
Exports spiked 60.6 percent on-year in the January-February period, well above analysts’ expectations, while imports rose 22.2 percent, official data showed on Sunday.
The latest figures stand in stark contrast to last year’s fall of around 17 percent in exports and 4 percent drop in imports.
The country struggled to contain the spread of Covid-19 early on, with consumers staying home and businesses seeing a slow return to operations.
The customs administration said comparison to last year is also likely to have bolstered the latest figures, saying in a statement that the “low base is one of the reasons for the larger increase this year.”
On Sunday, official data sho­wed that electronics exports rose 54.1 percent, while textiles including masks rose 50.2 percent.
China’s overall trade surplus came in at $103.3 billion, its customs administration said.
Meanwhile, the country’s trade surplus with the US — a key point of contention during the trade war pursued by former president Donald Trump — doubled from the same period last year to $51.3 billion.
Chinese authorities started combining January and February trade data last year, while it battled the coronavirus outbreak.
This is in line with how some other indicators are released, to smooth over distortions from the Lunar New Year holiday, which can fall in either month.
China’s foreign trade data remained strong despite the “off-season”, the customs authority said on Sunday.
Trade was also high due to a recovery in production and consumption in major economies such as Europe and the United States amid the coronavirus pandemic, as well as improvements in domestic consumption.
Although business activity usually falls during the Lunar New Year period when workers return to their hometowns, official appeals to avoid travelling this year to keep the Covid-19 outbreak in check supported production, the customs administration added.
“Many enterprises in major foreign trade provinces such as Guangdong and Zhejiang maintained production during the Lunar New Year,” it said. “Market demand is expected to rebound further.” Some companies have also been stocking up on goods such as integrated circuits, iron ore and crude oil imports.
“Global electronics demand has risen strongly due to the global shift to remote working and online shopping,” said Rajiv Biswas, Asia-Pacific chief economist for IHS Markit.
This had driven demand for electronics products such as laptops, mobile phones and wearables, he said.
Meanwhile, the strong import growth also reflected a “normalisation of consumer spending” in China, he said, after a severe slump due to lockdowns.",Newspaper
"Controversial material related to Aurat March on social media being investigated: minister
","March 15, 2021","The ""controversial material"" shared on social media concerning the Aurat March held on March 8 is being investigated, Minister for Religious Affairs Noorul Haq Qadri said on Sunday. 
""[We] will expose the culprits involved and register cases against them,"" he said in a statement. 
The minister said the elements who photoshopped banners from Aurat March before sharing them online ""will also be punished"".
The move comes after a video from the demonstration held in Karachi was 
 to falsely show participants raising blasphemous slogans and widely shared online.
The orga­ni­sers of Aurat March clarified that the participants of the march did not raise such slogans and their video was edited to defame their struggle.
On Friday, dozens of people from different groups blocked Khayaban-i-Suharwardy and Srinagar Highway in Islamabad during a 
 against Aurat March.
Officials of the capital administration and police said that the Sunni Rabta Council, State Youth Parliament Muslim Talba Mahaz and Muttahida Talba Mahaz staged separate protests at Aabpara Chowk. They demanded registration of FIRs against organisers and participants of Aurat March. 
In his statement, Qadri said blasphemous acts could not be allowed at any cost in Pakistan, adding that officials were trying to get to the bottom of the ""controversial material shared on social media"".
According to the minister, the banners displayed and alleged ""blasphemous"" slogans raised during the Aurat March events are also being investigated.
Aurat March has become an annual feature since 2018 and every year faces backlash from certain  religio-political parties, who have been opposing the event.
The marches are organised in major cities to highlight issues facing women and condemning incidents of violence against them as well as gender discrimination, economic exploitation and misogyny.
Following this year’s march on International Women’s Day, heated debates were once again seen on social media for and against the march.",Pakistan
"The closely spaced peaks and valleys of PSX
","March 15, 2021","Keeping aside last Friday’s relief rally, the first four days of the trading week witnessed a selling spree that eroded a staggering 3,058 points or 6.7 per cent from the index, showing the highest four-day loss since March 18, 2020 when the lockdowns were first clamped to stem the spread of Covid-19.
Analysts and major market participants who were in truth unable to defend or define the bloodbath mumbled that it was all due to higher inflation, political uncertainty, rise in Covid-19 cases and so on. 
Last Thursday, while foreign and local institutional investors took fresh positions, individuals (read leveraged investors) sold stocks worth a staggering $9 million. They chose to close their positions at market rates (lowest in the week) rather than meet the margin requirements. 
They were mainly the holders of pumped-up shares like TRG, priced at Rs146 from Rs12.87 a year ago on March 25, and Netsol Technologies worth Rs286, up from Rs27 a year ago. There were many other baits like Avanceon Ltd, Systems Ltd, Ghandhara Industries and National Refinery. 
In the four trading days, the plunge in stock prices was unbelievable: Netsol lost Rs42 or 15pc, TRG dipped Rs26 or 15pc, National Refinery was down Rs41or 6pc, Ghandhara Industries lost Rs60 or 21pc and Systems Ltd declined Rs54 or 11pc. As is always the case, the small unsuspecting investor who ventured into the market to make a fortune lost all their savings and departed beaten and bruised.
The few and feeble noises beseeching the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) to look into the massive fall in just four days have already died down after the market staged a spectacular rally last Friday by recovering 1,008 points or 2.36pc. 
Regarding the small investor who went back home penniless, a major market player said that the rule of caveat emptor (buyer beware) prevails. The greedy speculators bit more than they could chew and became a victim of the cold and cruel world of finance. 
But what made the market change its mind on the last trading day? Some tweets from influential people who are known to have the prime minister’s ear called for a probe. This might have done the trick. The entry of the bull last Friday was as dramatic as the earlier unexpected prowl of the bear.
Sources in the market, including a major broker, said the withdrawal of tax exemptions, reported to have been approved by the federal cabinet to raise additional Rs100-150 billion, was at the heart of the market meltdown in recent days. 
However, a clarification that emerged on March 12 (Friday) regarding those tax exemptions that would now be presented in the National Assembly for approval provided relief to the panicky investors. A major clause purported to be in the proposed bill related to the withdrawal of tax exemptions on mutual funds, which would have removed their pass-through status, subjecting funds to tax even when they distribute 90pc of their profit to certificate holders. “The amendments that came to light on Friday in the first half showed no change in the tax exemptions status of mutual funds while other amendments also seemed to have minimal impact on corporate profitability, which triggered the bull run,” said a market strategist.
Mohammad Shoaib, CEO of Al Meezan Investment Management, said the leveraged players are first to take the blow when the market comes under selling pressure as they have to unwind their positions. 
He reckoned that the current leverage position was heavy, including that of margin trading system, ready futures and CFS combined. “The higher the leverage, the greater will be the volatility in the market,” he said. Mr Shoaib concurred that the market chatter about the proposed withdrawal of tax exemptions to mutual funds had dented investor sentiments. 
The clarity that emerged on March 12 that such was not the case and the tax status of mutual funds remained unchanged was a relief for investors and certificate-holders. Mutual funds have skipped out of equities in recent days. They stand out as one of the largest sellers.
Mr Shoaib said 80-90pc of the cash that flows out of equities goes into other asset classes — such as fixed income funds, money market funds, balanced funds and income funds — within the same asset management company without any additional cost. He said higher inflation and the last week’s increase in the interest rates of six-month and one-year treasury bills suggested that a hike in the benchmark interest rate was on the cards. 
But growth in the sales of interest-rate sensitive sectors, like cement, oil, petroleum products and steel, will provide immunity against the slight hike in the interest rate, he said.
Raza Jafri, who is head of equities at Intermarket Securities, said the interest rates may become ‘normalised’ due to higher inflation going forward. Investors could move from cyclicals to banks, the latter having underperformed in the last year and a half. 
If commodity prices go up, higher interest rates will be healthy for banks and oil, two sectors that have 40pc weight in the index, he said. 
“If the policy rate, which currently is 7pc, remains in single digits, it will not dent corporate profitability,” he said. The market has already priced in a 1-1.5pc hike in interest rates. Mr Jafri said he believed cements still had value and so did the banks. The textile sector also has potential due to the government’s supportive policies, he added. ",Newspaper
"Over 100 people fleeing Myanmar enter India
","March 15, 2021","GAUHATI: More than 100 people fleeing Myanmar have entered a small village in India’s northeast, adding to scores who had already arrived since last month’s military coup in the neighbouring Southeast Asian country, a village leader said on Sunday.
A total of 116 Myanmar nationals crossed the Tiau River and reached Farkawn Village through a stretch where India’s paramilitary Assam Rifles personnel were not present, said Ramliana, president of the Farkawn Village Council, a community-based body. He uses one name.
There was no immediate comment from state or federal government officials. The village is in Mizoram state.
Ramliana did not give details as to when the people crossed over from Myanmar. Local media reports said that several of them were from Myanmar police and fire services.
Last week, India’s Home Ministry told four Indian states bordering Myanmar Mizoram, Manipur, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh to take measures to prevent refugees from entering India except on humanitarian grounds.
The ministry said the states were not authorised to accord refugee status to anyone entering India from Myanmar, as India is not a signatory to the UN Refugee Convention of 1951 or its 1967 Protocol.
Indian police have detained at least seven Myanmar police officers. They told Indian authorities they ran away because Myanmar’s army was on their trail after they refused to obey orders.
Indian police did not explain what orders the officers had refused. They wore civilian clothes and were not armed.
Earlier this month, Myanmar asked India to return the police officers who crossed the border.
India shares a 1,643-kilometre (1,020-mile) border with Myanmar, and is home to thousands of refugees from Myanmar in different states.",Newspaper
"Canada Post’s psychedelic trucks bring cheer amid pandemic gloom
","March 15, 2021","			
OTTAWA: Andrew Lewis is bringing bright colours to Canadians to counter their pandemic gloom one parcel at a time — delivered by postal trucks wrapped in his psychedelic design.
In 28 cities across the country, a fleet of 37 delivery vehicles — splashed with a big yellow sun and an image of a traditional red, white and blue Canada Post truck riding a rainbow across a multicoloured landscape emblazoned with the words “Thanks / Merci” — have hit the road to bring smiles door to door.
“I thought, what’s fun and happy and is going to connect with people,” to ease the melancholy and despair felt by many over the past year.
“I understood that people had been going bananas isolated at home without their usual social connections,” Lewis said in an interview from his London, Ontario studio.
“From a design standpoint, to convince a corporation like Canada Post to do this with one of their vehicles — remember this is their brand ambassador — is a triumph,” he said.
“No postal service in the world has done this in terms of this degree of playfulness and such a screwy idea.” The final design was submitted last September and trucks started rolling out in December. But Lewis himself first spotted one on a local street only last week. It was “bright and really different,” he said.
Postal carriers from across Canada have been snapping photographs of the delivery trucks and sharing them on social media.
Lewis’s own letter carrier, he recounted, banged on his door one recent morning to say he had seen one and “thought it was fantastic.”
The idea was born out of a proposed stamp intended by the postal service “to express gratitude and appreciation” to its 64,000 workers for dealing with a massive surge in parcel volumes during the pandemic, according to a message from chief executive Doug Ettinger to staff.
Since March 2020, said Canada Post spokeswoman Nicole Lecompte, “the sudden increase in online shopping boosted the volumes going through our network to the levels we normally observe only during the (Christmas) holiday season.” More than one million parcels were delivered each day for 181 consecutive delivery days last year, compared to 67 days leading up to Christmas in 2019, for example.
“It’s not just the volumes that increased, but also the number of larger household items, like mini-fridges, patio furniture and barbecues coming through our network,” Lecompte added.
Canada Post reached out to Lewis — one of the world’s top poster artists — to design the stamp.",Newspaper
"Decision to enforce biometric verification of pensioners put on hold
","March 15, 2021","KARACHI: The government decision to replace life certificates with biometric verification of pensioners twice a year has been put on hold after the authorities decided to go for more awareness and communication among the people before implementing the major decision, sources privy to the process said on Sunday.
The State Bank of Pakistan, they said, had last month issued a circular to the banks following the government’s decision to replace life certificates with biometric verification of pensioners twice a year, with immediate effect. It stated that the pensioner would be required to undergo biometric verification from any branch of a bank maintaining his or her pension account every year in March and September.
“The decision originally had to come in effect this month [March],” said a source. “However, this is not the case now. It has been put on hold to remove more confusion and spread more awareness of the benefits of the new system and this initiative. The authorities believe that the motive behind the move was not conveyed in a true spirit and it required more time to do this job. So the replacement of life certificates with biometric verification of pensioners twice a year is not going to be implemented this month.”
The new system, he said, was adopted to curb ghost pensioners and reduce the increasing burden on the budget. The overall pension spending as a share of tax revenue had reached 18.7 per cent as of FY20, almost double the level a decade earlier, he added.
According to the conventional system, he said, a pensioner had to produce a life certificate twice a year in the bank where he or she used to receive pension. The life certificates were endorsed by a gazetted officer.
The sources said that the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) had claimed to have acquired a sophisticated machine that could read the fingerprints of a person even after the age of 60 years, which the biometric system usually failed to do. Under the arrangements, pensioners would be sent to Nadra offices in case the biometric system failed to verify them. However, a number of pensioners had complained that the system did not recognise their fingerprints and they failed to get registered through biometric verification.
“I visited my bank last year for biometric verification,” a pensioner wrote to Dawn. “Despite the best efforts by the manager and the staff, they could not get my thumb impressions and fingerprints because they have faded due to old age. I am 87 years of age and for the last one year my mobility has been restricted. I believe the government’s decision may cause unnecessary inconvenience to old pensioners like me. In my opinion, such steps are being put in place because the financial burden of pension on the government has increased for various reasons. First, the average age in Pakistan has increased which is why pensioners may be living longer. Second, all the preceding governments increased the monthly pension by at least 10-15 per cent. Lastly, the government thinks there may be fake pensioners. However, I would cite here the maxim of English law: ‘Let 10 guilty persons escape rather than that one innocent suffer’.”
Amid complaints from pensioners, the government had also allowed the life certificates if the Nadra machine could not read the fingerprints due to overage. The SBP circular said that in order to bring transparency and ease the pension payment process, the standard operating procedures (SOPs) had been amended with immediate effect.
“The government has eased up the pension payments and decided to directly pay in the accounts of pensioners. Pension shall be paid through a bank account either current or PLS (profit and loss account) maintained in the pensioner’s name.
“If the pensioner is unable to undergo biometric verification due to incapacitation by bodily illness, infirmity, or if his or her fingerprints do not exist due to old age or a genetic condition, he or she will provide a life certificate as per the SOPs,” said the circular.",Pakistan
"One arrested after cleric Muhammad Ali Mirza survives attack in Jhelum
","March 15, 2021","Popular cleric Engineer Muhammad Ali Mirza survived an assassination attempt at a religious academy in Punjab's Jhelum district, police said on Monday.
A suspect who allegedly attacked Mirza with a sharp-edged weapon on Sunday afternoon was taken into custody and a case was registered against him. 
Mirza, a resident of Machine Mohallah of Jhelum city, has regularly been uploading his recorded as well as live videos of lectures and speeches on his social media pages and has 4.6 million followers on his 
.
In the First Information Report (FIR) of the incident registered on Mirza's complaint under Section 324 (attempted murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code, the cleric stated that he delivered a weekly 
 (Islamic lesson) at a research academy situated in a building. 
After Mirza delivered the lecture on Sunday afternoon, a man charged towards the cleric with a sharp-edged weapon ""with the intention of murder"" in the presence of many people, the FIR said. According to a police spokesperson, the incident occurred when Mirza was having photos taken after the lecture.
Mirza in his complaint said although the attacker was reaching for his neck, he moved quickly and was struck on his shoulder instead. The assailant then made a second attempt to reach Mirza but was stopped by two men present in the hall, according to the FIR. 
Police spokesperson Chaudhry Mohammad Imran of City police station said Mirza had sustained a minor injury in the incident and was allowed to go home after being given first aid.
He identified the assailant as a 21-year-old resident of Lahore who had come to Jhelum ""with the intention of murder"".
After being arrested from the spot, the suspect accused Mirza of ""deceiving people"" and strongly took offence to his teachings, the police official said.

 and booked Mirza for uttering derogatory and instigating remarks against known religious scholars. He was released a day later after a local court accepted his bail plea.",Pakistan
"India must make first move to normalise ties: PM
","March 18, 2021","ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Wednesday said that India would have to make the first move to normalise ties with Pakistan.
“We are trying, but India would have to take the first step and unless it does that we cannot move ahead,” Mr Khan said while inaugurating the first edition of the two-day Islamabad Security Dialogue hosted by the National Security Division in collaboration with government-funded think tanks.
The prime minister, however, did not elaborate what he expected India to do as the first step to resumption of ties.
The perpetually tense relations between the two countries, which have fought three wars, besides engaging in several episodes of limited conflict, to quote the words of PM Khan, suffered a “breakdown” after India forcibly and illegally annexed Occupied Jammu and Kashmir on Aug 5, 2019.
However, the two countries sprung a surprise last month by announcing resumption of ceasefire at the Line of Control (LoC) after a ‘hotline contact’ between the director generals of military operations of the two countries. Many believe that agreement was made possible through a backchannel, although Pakistani officials strongly deny it.
No violation has since then been reported at LoC and importantly there has been visible reduction in rhetoric from both sides. Prime Minister Khan’s speech at Islamabad Dialogue too was without the usual criticism of the Indian government, whom he had in the past likened to Nazis of Germany, and its actions, especially in Kashmir.
In an apparent explanation of the change in the tone, the prime minister said Pakistan could not fully exploit its geo-economic potential unless it improved its ties with neighbours by strengthening trading connection and establishing peace in the region.
Mr Khan said Kashmir issue was the lone irritant standing in the way of better ties between Pakistan and India.
“We have to see how we can resolve it through dialogue and establish relations like civilised neighbours,” the prime minister further said.
Peace, he said, would benefit both countries. “If poverty has to be eradicated, our trading and economic ties should be strong in addition to greater connectivity,” he maintained.
India, Mr Khan said, could access resource-rich Central Asia if there was peace.
He also touched upon efforts for peace in Afghanistan and said that there was a hope for political settlement of the protracted conflict after a very long time. He at the same time noted that there were still enormous challenges in the way of peace in Afghanistan. “No one should underestimate how difficult it is. There are still many challenges,” he maintained.
Pakistan is participating in a meeting of the ‘expanded troika’ on Afghan peace being held on Thursday in Moscow. Meanwhile, the US is preparing for setting up a regional compact on Afghanistan, whose meeting is likely to be held next month.
The peace talks between Taliban and Afghan government currently underway in Doha are stalemated and much of the diplomatic effort is currently focused on accelerating the process and achieving some sort of understanding before the May 1 deadline for troops withdrawal in US-Taliban agreement signed in Feb 2020.
The prime minister also called for a comprehensive and expanded view of national security in the light of emerging non-traditional threats like climate change, food security, and economic security.
Mr Khan, on this occasion, also launched a Policy Advisory Portal, which has been developed by the National Security Division to engage over 100 think tanks and academia over policy making.",Newspaper

"Retailers jack up flour prices after sharp increase in wheat rate
","March 18, 2021","KARACHI: Sindh’s new wheat crop has landed in Karachi’s wholesale market with the highest-ever price tag of Rs5,000 per 100 kg bag, fuelling fears it may trigger price distortions in the country, it emerged on Wednesday.
The sharp hike in wheat rate is due to a massive increase to Rs2,000 per 40 kg in the wheat procurement price by the Sindh government. Last year, the wheat procurement price in Sindh was fixed at Rs1,400 per 40kg, which took the per 100kg bag price to Rs4,100.
Meanwhile, market retailers further pushed up the rate of branded five kg bag of fine flour up to Rs380 from Rs370 and 10 kg bag for Rs740 versus Rs720. The retailers maintain that the price hike came after millers increased prices. Earlier this year in January, five kg and 10 kg flour bags were available at Rs350 and Rs680, respectively.
“I have not seen such a big difference in the open market rates of wheat in many decades. This is because of the high support price of wheat by the Sindh government,” said Pakistan Flour Mills Association (PFMA), Sindh, Chairman Chaudhry Muhammad Yousuf.
Flour millers are already fighting a case with the federal government, seeking uniformity in wheat support prices all over the country. According to reports, the Punjab government has fixed Rs1,650 per 40 kg support price while Sindh is offering Rs2,000 per 40 kg to its growers for this season.
In a letter to Federal Minister for National Food Security and Research Syed Fakhr Imam, PFMA Central Chairman Badar-ud-Din Kakar and Sindh Zone Chairman said that mismatched policies in the four provinces were resulting in difficulties.
Urging consensus in wheat procurement price and flour rates, the PFMA representatives urged the federal government to exercise its constitutional obligation by bringing purchase/sale rate of wheat and flour on one level within the country to provide equal facilities to the masses during 2021-22.
They recalled that last year, provincial governments had announced wheat support price with mutual understanding, while this year the rate of wheat and flour are going to be different in all the provinces which would create an atmosphere of chaos.
On the arrival of the new Sindh crop, Mr Yousuf said: “The new Sindh crop has a moisture content of 18-19 per cent which is not feasible for wheat grinding for flour manufacturing.”
“It will take a week to bring the moisture level to 10-11pc which will be fit for flour-making,” he said, adding that millers are using imported wheat for making various varieties of flour.
The Sindh crop will fully reach the markets by April 15-16 while Punjab crop will start arriving from the second week of the next month.
When asked about the latest hike in flour prices, the Sindh PFMA chief rejected the retailers’ stance and claimed that millers had not enhanced the rate for the last two months. Flour No 2.5 price has been intact at Rs60 per kg followed by fine and super fine flour at Rs62 per kg, he said. “Rate of flour in Karachi is cheaper than Punjab by Rs5 per kg,” he further claimed.
When asked why there was no price relief for consumers despite huge wheat imports and local crop last year, he said that there was a need to liberalise the policy in which millers get wheat freely without any bottleneck to ensure smooth supply of flour and stability in prices.",Newspaper

"Lahore court orders registration of FIR against Babar Azam, others in harassment case
","March 18, 2021","A sessions court in Lahore has ordered the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) Cyber Crime Circle to register a first information report (FIR) against Pakistan cricket captain Babar Azam and others in a harassment case, noting that a regular inquiry had already started into the matter. 
Judge Hamid Hussain passed the order on the petition of a woman, Hamiza Mukhtar, on Wednesday.
The petitioner alleged that she was constantly receiving ""threatening messages"" from different mobile numbers on WhatsApp. The unknown persons also used to ""threaten and blackmail her that they have her objectionable pictures and videos and will upload [them] on social media in order to harm her repute in society and ruin her life"".
Mukhtar had turned to the FIA to trace the unknown numbers, in the process of which it was found that one of the numbers was registered in the name of one Muhammad Babar Azam, according to a report submitted to the court by the FIA.
The owners of the mobile numbers — Maryam Ahmed, Muhammad Babar and Salme BB — were served notices to join the FIA's inquiry proceedings to record their version, the report added. Of the three, only Ahmed appeared in front of the agency and denied that she knew the petitioner and had sent her abusive messages.
According to the report, Ahmed had stated that she would provide her mobile phone for technical analysis but she failed to do so.

"Rashid invites opposition for talks on election reforms
","March 30, 2021","ISLAMABAD: Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed on Monday invited the divided opposition for talks on electoral reforms and nine other vital areas to serve the national cause.
Talking to reporters here on Monday, he referred to the ongoing rift between two main components of the opposition Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), saying the unity of PDM was now in tatters and the anti-government alliance had failed in achieving its objective of ousting Prime Minister Imran Khan from office.
“Let us sit in the National Assembly… and move forward,” he said while inviting all opposition parties, including the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), to sit with the government and bring reforms in at least 10 key areas.
He said the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) had completed around three years in government and only two years were left. “In power, the time passes quickly while the days appear to be long in opposition,” he remarked.
He said the time was short and the opposition should come and help the government bring about reforms in the country’s electoral process and police, besides improving local government system and jointly working on a development agenda.
He was of the view that the sooner it was done it would be better.
“The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) have parted their ways forever,” the interior minister said.
He went on to say that the two opposition parties had been opposing each other throughout their political life and only had joined hands to remove Prime Minister Imran Khan.
“By the grace of Allah, they could not oust him (PM) from power and they are now on the back foot themselves.” He further said that the ball was actually in the court of JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman. He also prayed for early recovery of the Maulana and PML-N vice president Maryam Nawaz.
In reply to a question whether the PTI has any role in bringing rifts within the PDM, Sheikh Rashid said that it was neither success of the government nor it had any role in the PDM’s affairs. It was only inefficiency of the opposition, he added.
He admitted that there was inflation in the country, but PM Khan was making efforts to bring it down. The prime minister had instructed his cabinet, the party’s core committee and political committee to work hard to bring down inflation, he added.
About reshuffle in the cabinet, the interior minister said that such reshuffles were a matter of routine. “A minister remains a minister whether he is at one place or other, in one ministry or the other.”
He also said that his portfolio was not being changed and that he was at the right place. “PM Imran Khan is also the captain of politics, I stand by him, I have come with him, will go with him and will play where he will require me to play.”
He told reporters that passport and Nadra (National Database and Registration Authority) offices would be established in every district throughout the country.
In reply to a question, he said it was for the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) to decide on imposition of lockdown in Islamabad to contain the spread of virus.
His ministry’s duty was only to implement the decision, he added.
He said that the Ministry of Interior was going to introduce an application (App) for citizens to lodge their complaints against all departments, including Nadra that work under the ministry. He said that all corrupt officials working in the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on same positions for last 20 years would be removed.",Pakistan
"Thousands flee airstrikes by Myanmar forces in border area
","March 30, 2021","MAE SAKOEP: Thai soldiers began sending back some of the thousands of people who have fled a series of airstrikes by the military in neighboring Myanmar, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.
But Thai officials denied that insecurity on the border added a new dimension to an already volatile crisis set off by a coup in Myanmar.
The weekend strikes, which sent ethnic Karen people seeking safety in Thailand, represented another escalation in the violent crackdown by Myanmar’s junta on protests against its Feb 1 takeover.
On Saturday, more than 100 people were killed in and around demonstrations throughout the country the bloodiest single day since the takeover.
The violence by the Myanmar military both on the border and in cities around the country raised the question of whether the international community would respond more forcefully than it has thus far to a coup that ousted the government led by Aung San Suu Kyi and reversed years of progress towards democracy.
In response to reports of people fleeing the airstrikes, Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha said earlier on Monday that the country didn’t want mass migration but that it was preparing for an influx of people and would take human rights issues into consideration.
But later, three people with knowledge of the matter said Thai soldiers had begun to force people to return to Myanmar.
They told them it was safe to go back even though it is not safe. They were afraid to go back but they had no choice, said a spokesperson for the Karen Peace Support Network, a group of Karen civil society organisations in Myanmar.
Two other people confirmed that refugees were being sent back to Myanmar. All three spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the issue.
A spokesman for Thailand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, however, said claims that some Karen were being forced to return to Myanmar were inaccurate.
Those reports cite information solely from non-official sources without confirming the facts from official sources on the ground. ... In fact, the Thai authorities will continue to look after those on the Thai side while assessing the evolving situation and the needs on the ground, Tanee Sangrat wrote in a statement.
In one border area, Thai soldiers refused to let journalists or curious locals approach or speak to those who had fled.
Myanmar aircraft carried out three strikes overnight Sunday, according to Dave Eubank, a member of the Free Burma Rangers, a humanitarian relief agency that delivers medical and other assistance to villagers. The strikes severely injured one child but caused no apparent fatalities, he said.
Earlier strikes had sent about 2,500 people into northern Thai­land’s Mae Hong Son province and left at least four people dead and many wounded, according to the agency.
One witness described a chaotic scene as he watched hundreds of people cross the river border Sunday into Mae Hong Son.
“There were many children and women. It seemed like they had basic supplies to sustain themselves, but I don’t know how long they can last without help,” said La Rakpaoprai, who buys snacks and other goods in the mountainous border village of Mae Sakoep and sells them in remote areas.",Newspaper

"China warns companies against politicising actions regarding Xinjiang
","March 30, 2021","BEIJING: Chinese officials on Monday said Sweden’s H&M and other foreign companies should not to make rash moves or step into politics after the companies raised concerns about forced labour in Xinjiang, sparking furious online backlash and boycotts.
H&M, Burberry, Nike and Adidas and other Western brands have been hit by consumer boycotts in China since last week over comments about their sourcing of cotton in Xinjiang. The growing rift comes as the United States and other Western governments increase pressure on China over suspected human-rights abuses in the western region.
“I don’t think a company should politicise its economic behaviour,” said Xu Guixiang, a Xinjiang government spokesman at a news conference on Monday morning. “Can H&M continue to make money in the Chinese market? Not any more.” “To rush into this decision and get involved in the sanctions is not reasonable. It’s like lifting a stone to drop it on one’s own feet,” he said.
Chinese social media users last week began circulating a 2020 statement by H&M announcing it would no longer source cotton from Xinjiang.
H&M said at the time the decision was due to difficulties conducting credible due diligence in the region and after media and human rights’ groups reported the use of forced labour in Xinjiang — a charge that Beijing has repeatedly denied.
Elijan Anayat, another Xinjiang government spokesman, said during the briefing that Chinese people do not want the products of companies such as H&M and Nike that have boycotted Xinjiang’s cotton. He said he welcomed companies to take trips to the region’s cotton fields to see for themselves what is happening.
Washington on Friday condemned what it called a “state-led” social media campaign in China against US and other international companies for committing not to use cotton from Xinjiang.
The wave of consumer boycotts in China has coincided with a coordinated set of sanctions imposed by Britain, Canada, the European Union and the United States last week over what they say are human rights abuses taking place in Xinjiang.
The US government has publicly accused Beijing of genocide against the Uighur Muslim ethnic minorities in the region.
Xu repeatedly rejected accusations of genocide and human rights abuses in the region and accused the Western powers of engaging in political manipulation to destabilise China with the sanctions.
“They have lost their minds and their conscience, they are enthusiastic about political manipulation and the abuse of sanctions, to a level that is hysterical,” said Xu.
“Their real purpose by fabricating the issue of genocide is to disrupt security and stability in China,” Anayat said.
The United States in January announced an import ban on all cotton and tomato products from the area due to allegations of forced labour from detained Uighur Muslims.
Western governments and rights groups have previously accused authorities in the far-western region of detaining and torturing Uighurs in camps, where some former inmates have said they were subject to ideological indoctrination.
China has repeatedly denied all such charges and say the camps are for vocational training and combating religious extremism.",Newspaper
"Sindh, Balochistan likely to see first heatwave of the season this week: Met Office
","March 30, 2021","The Pakistan Meteorological Department on Tuesday issued a heatwave alert for most plain areas of the country for the ongoing week during which temperatures are likely to rise 4-6 degrees Celsius above normal. 
""Mainly hot and dry weather is expected during the week due to which heatwave conditions are likely in most plain areas of the country,"" the Met Office said in an

According to the alert, Sindh, southern Punjab, and eastern and southern Balochistan will remain in the grip of very hot and dry weather from Tuesday (today) to Saturday. Temperatures are also likely to rise in most sub-mountainous areas of the country, it said. 
""Dust raising winds are expected in Sindh and Balochistan during the period,"" the advisory added, stating that day temperatures were expected to remain 4-6 degrees above normal conditions in most plain areas.
Following the issuance of the alert, the Rehabilitation Department of the Sindh government in a letter addressed to all deputy commissioners of the province asked them to ""take necessary precautionary measures to avert any loss of life during [the] heatwave"". 
In 2015, Karachi 
 the deadliest heatwave Pakistan had seen in over 50 years.
Starting June 19 that year, the coastal city witnessed sweltering heat that continued for more than five days and in its wake left over 1,200 people dead and 40,000 suffering from heatstroke and heat exhaustion.
			
According to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA), those living in urban areas are more prone to being affected by heatwaves as urban centres tend to become heat islands. In 2015, 65,000 people were treated at 50 rehabilitating centres in Karachi's most affected ─ and densely populated ─ areas.

"Fawad seeks opposition help to reform judiciary, ECP
","April 5, 2021","LAHORE: Giving a reference to a Transparency International report, Federal Science and Technology Minister Fawad Chaudhry says the report has suggested that the people of Pakistan think that the country’s judicial system is in a shambles that needs reforms. 
“The judicial system will not reform until the government, the opposition and judiciary won’t sit together.” 
“It will be better if the opposition sits with the government, reforms the election process for holding the next elections in a free and fair manner and lets the winner form the next government,” he suggested while speaking at a press conference here on Sunday. 
Mr Chaudhry asked the opposition parties to come out of Imran Khan phobia after failure of their two-and-a-half years struggle to oust the PTI government. 
“If you (opposition) want to continue with this effort for another year, it is your choice.” 
The federal minister urged the opposition parties to cooperate with the government for reforming the Election Commission of Pakistan and judiciary, adding that all the stakeholders, including the government, and the people had reservations about the working of these institutions. He said the government and the opposition both agreed that the Senate and Daska election were not fair and this warranted that the system needed reforms. 
Fawad Chaudhry stressed that reforms were needed to run the election process in Pakistan in a fair and transparent manner. 
“In this age of technology and transformation, the PTI government wants to adopt an electronic voting system to declare results within seconds after polling and with minimum chances of corruption and rigging.” 
The federal minister said the true leaders of the PML-N and PPP should take notice of their leaders’ childish policies whose decisions were squeezing their established political parties in the country. 
“The PML-N and PPP should review their policies and politics and take steps towards national politics,” he suggested to the opposition parties while lauding the PPP for, what he called, withdrawing itself from PML-N and PDM’s do-or-die politics, referring to the PPP’s stakes in the current system with government in Sindh when Maryam Nawaz and Maulana Fazlur Rahman had no stakes in the system. 
Mr Chaudhry also said the PTI was the only party in the country that could field its candidates in more than 1,000 constituencies out of total 1,150 constituencies. 
He did not go much in the question of showing some sympathy towards Maryam Nawaz (regarding her health), saying that Nawaz Sharif’s cronies had created a drama and took him out of Pakistan. He said treatment of every person, including Maryam Nawaz, should be held in Pakistan. 
The federal minister hoped that the committee that had done Nawaz’s tests wouldn’t do Maryam’s. 
Fawad chided the Punjab bureaucracy for its failure to resolve Lahore’s problems, including waste disposal. 
“The Punjab chief secretary and Lahore commissioner should go home if they could not solve Lahore’s waste collection problems,” he said and added that Prime Minister Imran Khan could not involve himself to resolve such issues. He said it was the duty of the provincial governments in Lahore as well as Karachi to introduce projects to produce energy from waste. 
The PM had warned the officers who were not performing of being sacked, he said but added that all implementation work could not be left to bureaucracy alone. 
Answering a question, the federal minister said the Buzdar government was running successfully and added that Buzdar would keep holding office till he enjoyed prime minister’s confidence. 
Mr Chaudhry said the Ramazan moon would be sighted on April 13 and the nation would have its first fast on April 14. However, he added that he had been told by the Federal Religious Affairs Minister Noorul Haq Qadri that the moon sighting would be announced by the Ruet-e-Hilal Committee.",Pakistan

"CPEC entering important phase, says minister
","April 5, 2021","KARACHI: Federal Minister for Planning and Development Asad Umar said on Sunday the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is entering an important phase as the projects to be built under it pertain not just to infrastructure but other vital areas as well.
Just as the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government worked day and night to contain the spread of Covid-19, it would strive to make every project launched under the umbrella of CPEC a success, said the minister.
He was speaking at a ceremony held at the port here to mark the arrival of equipment and machinery for setting up a steel mill in the Rashakai Special Economic Zone.
Mr Umar termed the occasion another manifestation of the exceptional relations between Pakistan and China.
He said that CRBC, a Chinese firm, had entered into an agreement with the government for attracting foreign investment for development and marketing of the Rashakai economic zone.
The work for provision of basic necessities, including electricity, at the economic zone was going on at a fast pace, said the minister.
He said the Chinese company called Century Steel would set up a steel mill at the Rashakai economic zone with an investment of $240 million. The mill would produce about 1.5 million tonnes of steel per year.
During the construction phase of the project over 600 Pakistanis would get jobs while in the second phase more than 1,000 people would be provided employment.
Turning to the issue of China-Pakistan relations, Mr Umar simply said whenever Islamabad needed assistance Beijing was there to help the former.
Speaking on the occasion, Chinese Consul General in Karachi Li Bijian said that due to concerted efforts of the PTI government Pakistan’s economy was improving despite the negative effects of Covid-19 pandemic. In particular, the construction sector was witnessing growth and the demand for steel had increased.
Due to the great efforts put in by the two countries, the first phase of CPEC had been completed successfully, said the consul general.
“We are quite confident of attracting more and more investments to the Rashakai SEZ,” said Mr Li.
He thanked the Pakistan government, in particular chairman of the CPEC Authority Asim Saleem Bajwa, for his untiring efforts to turn CPEC into a success story.
He said the arrival of equipment and machinery for the Century Steel’s plant at Rashakai was just a beginning as several more projects were in the pipeline.
Besides the federal minister and the Chinese consul general, Mr Bajwa, representatives of Century Steel, and officers of the Karachi Port Trust were present on the occasion.",Newspaper
"Many NHA projects come to a halt as govt fails to release funds
","April 5, 2021","ISLAMABAD: Billions of rupees’ development projects of the National Highway Authority (NHA) have virtually come to a halt due to a lack of disbursement of funds under the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) for the third quarter of the current fiscal year.
The NHA contractors did not get payments for the last three months because of non-release of funds and as a result they adopted a policy of either go-slow or abandoned the infrastructure projects, including those being executed under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).
However, Minister for Planning and Development Asad Umar said on Sunday that all CPEC-related projects were heading towards completion on a fast pace.
The projects affected are mostly situated in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab and Balochistan.
The government allocated Rs119 billion to the NHA in 2020-21, but the ministry concerned released only 30 per cent of the funds, making it difficult for the department to complete the projects in time.
According to an official of the communication ministry, funds for the third quarter were to be released on Jan 1, but they were released in April. The relevant ministries are bound to release PSDP funds to the NHA at the beginning of all four quarters of the fiscal year.
The contractors wait for the release of funds and in case of no-release they purchase construction material on credit and sometimes halt the projects due to non-payment of dues.
The same has happened in the third quarter of the current year when contractors were not paid their dues and they stopped work on the projects.
Major NHA development projects affected due to non-release of funds by the government include Package-6 Rehabilitation of National Highway & Bridges, Fazilpur; D.I. Khan Lot-3 Ramak-D.I. Khan; Construction of Hakla on M-I to Yarik; D.I. Khan Motorway (CPEC) (Rehmani Khel to Kot Balian), Package-2B; Construction of Hakla on M-I to Yarik D.I.

When contacted, a senior official of the NHA, who did not want to be named, told Dawn that the planning division was responsible for the delay in release of funds. He, however, said the finance ministry had released the funds for the third quarter and the NHA would get them on Monday.",Newspaper
"SHC orders determination of girl’s age in freewill marriage case
","April 5, 2021","KARACHI: The Sindh High Court has directed the provincial health department to constitute a medical board to determine the age of a girl who has contracted a freewill marriage.
The two-judge bench headed by Justice K. K. Agha also directed the police to cancel a case registered against a couple on the complaint of a girl’s parents since the petitioner stated that she had not been abducted, but she had contracted marriage with Jehanzeb.
The bench also ordered the senior superintendent of police Ghotki to take disciplinary proceeding against the investigating officer of the case because he had not conducted the investigation fairly since the IO completely failed to record the statement of the girl till the matter came in the court and in the meantime he proceeded to arrest the relatives of Jehanzeb in order to pressurise him to return the girl.
The petitioners Majida, a resident of Ghotki, and Jehanzeb, residing in Korangi, through their counsel moved the SHC and submitted that they contracted marriage against the consent of Majida’s parents and the parents lodged a case against Jehanzeb in Ghotki. The petitioners pleaded for protection.
When the matter came up for hearing, the father of the girl submitted a children certificate issued by the National Database and Registration Authority which showed that she was around 15 years old. However, the girl could not produce any prove about her age and contended that she was 18 years old.
Subsequently, the bench directed the secretary of health to form a medical board within three days comprising doctors with specialisation in age determination to examine the petitioner girl and sought its report within 10 days.
The bench also directed the SHO of the Korangi police station to provide protection to the couple and produce them before court on the next date of hearing.",Pakistan

"De Kock escapes fake fielding charge over Fakhar Zaman's controversial run-out
","April 5, 2021","South African wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock is unlikely to face any sanction over the run-out of Fakhar Zaman during the Proteas' 17-run win in the second ODI, according to reports.
After reviewing footage of the incident, match officials are believed to have come to the conclusion that de Kock was not in breach of the law on fielders deceiving batsmen.
In the last over of the match, with Pakistan still needing 30 to win, de Kock seemingly gestured for South African Aiden Markram to throw to the bowler's end, where Haris Rauf was heading.
Fakhar, who had struck an outstanding 193, looked behind him, away from the direction of the fielder, as he was running towards the wicketkeeper and was surprised when Markram's throw hit the stumps at that end.
Social media immediately 
 with cries that de Kock had flouted the law on fake fielding which states that “it is unfair for any fielder wilfully to attempt, by word or action, to distract, deceive or obstruct either batsman after the striker has received the ball.”
			
Fakhar admitted after the match that he had been taken by surprise but did not attempt to deflect blame for the dismissal on to cheating by the South African wicketkeeper.
“I was looking at Haris Rauf because I thought the run-out would be at his end. It was my own fault,” he said at the post-match press conference.
Officials are understood to have deemed that de Kock's actions were not a trick and that he was indicating for the throw to go to the bowler's end.
South African fielder Tabraiz Shamsi tweeted on Monday that de Kock was calling for a fielder to back up the throw at the non-striker's end.
			
“QDK was NOT speaking 2 or pointing at the batsman, he was asking a fielder to back up at the non strikers end,” tweeted Shamsi.
“Not Quinny's fault the batsman turned around 2 see instead of completing the run safely which he should have done.”",Sport
"Big industrial output expands 4.85pc in February
","April 14, 2021","ISLAMABAD: Large-scale manufacturing (LSM) grew by 4.85 per cent in February reflecting a slowdown in the industrial output, data released by Pakistan Bureau of Statistics showed on Tuesday.
On a month-on-month basis, big industry production contracted by 4.15pc.
The LSM expansion slowed in January after posting double-digit growth in December and November on the back of higher automobile, cement products, and one-time sugar output which reflects the revival of industrialisation.
In December and November 2020, LSM grew by 11.4pc and 14.5pc on a year-on-year basis.
During the first eight months (July-February) 2020-21, the LSM grew by 7.45pc.
The medium-term Budget Strategy Paper, released on Tuesday, showed that the LSM surpassed its pre-Covid level of production in January, exhibiting 9.1pc growth on a year-on-year basis (negative 5.7pc in January 2020) while on a month-on-month basis it increased by 5.4pc in January 2021 (13.5pc in December 2020).
Overall, during July-January 2020-21, LSM grew by 7.9pc against 3.2pc contraction last year.
Since July 2020, the LSM has rebounded after suffering months of a downturn on account of Covid-19 mainly in the construction, textile, food, chemicals, non-metallic mineral products, automobile and pharmaceutical sectors. The uptick during the eight months of FY21 reflects a revival in economic activities.
The PBS snapshot of the manufacturing activity showed that eight out of 15 sub-sectors in LSM rose during the month under review. Low-interest rates and reduction in duties on raw materials are expected to further spur economic activities in the current fiscal year.
Sector-wise, production of 11 items under the Oil Companies Advisory Committee was up by 42.66pc year-on-year during February. The 36 items under the Ministry of Industries and Production rose by 3.16pc, while 65 items reported by the provincial Bureaus of Statistics were up 4.83pc.
LSM represents nearly 80pc of the country’s total manufacturing and accounts for nearly 10.7pc of the national output. In comparison, the small-scale industry makes up for just 1.8pc of GDP and 13.7pc of the secondary sector.
As per the PBS data, sub-sectors excluding trucks and buses within the automobile sector posted massive growth in February from a year ago. Production of tractors rose by 42.47pc, jeep and cars 37.24pc, LCVs 37.19pc, and motorcycles 16.85pc during the month under review. The production of trucks dipped 17.01pc and buses 19.70pc.
The cement output also grew 11.68pc during the month under review on the back of greater demand following the start of construction activities and increase in exports from the country.
The production of paints and varnishes was up 44.10pc. Sugar production is up by 1.10pc in February from a year ago due to end period of the sugar crushing season.
In pharmaceuticals, the output of syrups rose by 30.36pc, injection 2.15pc, and capsules 18.74pc. The output of tablets dipped 0.95pc, and ointments 14.24pc, respectively.

"Tareen submits reply to FIA on foreign assets
","April 14, 2021","LAHORE:  Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s disgruntled leader Jehangir Khan Tareen on  Tuesday submitted a reply to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA)  regarding allegations against him, including having illegal foreign  assets, in connection with the sugar scam.  
Mr Tareen had also  called for a transparent inquiry demanding “a fair and noncontroversial  investigation team, which could meet the requirements of justice and  doesn’t follow instructions given to it on telephone calls.”
On  Tareen’s reply submitted to the FIA, the agency said it would inform the  court about its findings after examining the record presented to it by  the sugar baron so far.
“The FIA team is minutely examining all  the records shared [by Mr Tareen] since the start of the sugar inquiry  on Aug, 8, 2020. It is checking whether the record shared with it is  relevant or irrelevant,” FIA Lahore Director Muhammad Rizwan, who heads  the sugar scam investigation team, told Dawn.
He said the FIA would present its findings to the trial court on the next date of hearing on April 22.
Mr  Tareen pleaded before the FIA in a reply that no offence had ever been  committed by his company (JDW) or by him and no proof of any such  offence was brought forth either by the Joint Investigation Team (JIT)  or the Combined Investigation Team (CIT).
He said all transactions  were financially prudent under the circumstances in which they were  carried out. The JDW had provided documentary evidence to establish the  transparent, legitimate, and bona fide nature of each transaction, he  added.
He said the JDW had paid Rs15 billion annual tax revenue to  the national exchequer and was amongst the highest tax payers in the  sugar industry, as well as other industries.
The FIA had probed  into the increase in the sugar prices and the subsidy obtained by sugar  barons, including Mr Tareen, during the last five years.
In its  report submitted to Prime Minister Imran Khan last year, the FIA  Director General Wajid Zia had revealed that two main groups had  obtained maximum benefit during the crisis, one of these being JDW of Mr  Tareen that had six sugar mills. As per the report, the JDW obtained  12.28 percent of the total export subsidy amounting to Rs3.058bn during  2015-18.
In his last appearance before an FIA team in Lahore, Mr  Tareen reportedly could not provide a money trail of Rs4.35bn related to  the sale of JKFSL’s sugarcane business assets and liabilities. He,  according to the agency sources, could not offer a “satisfactory reply”  regarding some other business transactions and money laundering charges  also.
The FIA has launched a probe into foreign properties of Tareen and his family members.  
Meanwhile, as many as 25 lawmakers of the ruling party released a  letter to the media on Tuesday they have sent to Prime Minister Imran  Khan seeking a hearing in person so that they could explain their point  of view on the issue. 
The letter by the 25 PTI lawmakers says:  “Firstly, we would like to state that the meeting (between Tareen and 25  lawmakers) was held in an effort to strengthen PTI. Mr Tareen is a  party asset and his services for the PTI are unforgettable. We believe  that his name and reputation are being targeted on the pretext of  investigation. This is an agenda-driven activity by the people who have  bias against him (Tareen) and misled and poisoned you (PM) against him.”
It  further states, “We do not oppose any investigation [against Mr  Tareen]. We just want it done fairly. We request that a new  investigation team be formed that is unbiased and not prejudiced. We  request to see you in person to explain our feeling and point of view in  this regard.”

"India, big vaccine exporter, now seeks imports as Covid cases soar
","April 14, 2021","			
NEW DELHI: India is to fast-track emergency approvals for Covid-19 vaccines that have been authorised by Western countries and Japan, paving the way for possible imports of Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, and Moderna shots.
The move, which will drop the need for companies to do small, local safety trials for their vaccines before seeking emergency approval, follows the world’s biggest surge in cases in the country this month.
India has the biggest vaccine manufacturing capacity in the world and had exported tens of millions of doses before its own demand skyrocketed and led to a shortage in some states.
Its need for imports would be a blow to dozens of poor countries that had relied on the country to run their inoculation drives.
India’s health ministry said vaccines authorised by the World Health Organisation or authorities in the United States, Europe, the United Kingdom and Japan “may be granted emergency use approval in India, mandating the requirement of post-approval parallel bridging clinical trial”.
“If any of these regulators have approved a vaccine, the vaccine is now ready to be brought into the country for use, manufacture and fill-and-finish,” Vinod Kumar Paul, a senior government health official, told a news conference.
“We hope and we invite the vaccine makers such as Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson and others ... to be ready to come to India as early as possible.” Pfizer said it would work towards bringing its vaccine to India after withdrawing its application in February.
India has administered more than 108 million doses, sold more than 54.6 million vaccine doses abroad and gifted more than 10 million to partner countries.

"Jumping the gun: Saudis keep ‘Taasheer’ war dance alive
","April 14, 2021","			
TAIF: In Saudi Arabia’s west, classic muzzle-loading rifles are carefully prepared for the traditional “Taasheer” war dance, a striking display of leaping and gunpowder blasts.
Men and boys take weapons laid out in the bed of a truck and fill the barrels with gunpowder before, one by one, they take centre stage to showcase their skills in what is also known as the fire dance.
Dozens of onlookers, including women and children, stand on the sidelines of a grassy clearing lined with gazebo tents. In a collision of the ancient and the modern, some hold up mobile phones to film the spectacle.
Barefoot and in their traditional thobe and ghutra headdress, the performers dance to traditional music against the backdrop of mountains in the western province of Taif.
They bounce up and down with their knees pressed close together, as they wave the gun and finally reach for the sky and fire at the ground, resulting in a blast of sparks and smoke under their feet.
A tribal tradition believed to date back hundreds of years, the dance is now performed at weddings, festivals and on other special occasions.
In a rapidly modernising kingdom, which is undergoing dramatic economic and social reforms spearheaded by the de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudis are seeking to maintain some long-held traditions.",Newspaper
"Babar Azam dethrones Kohli to become top ranked ODI batsman
","April 14, 2021","Pakistan captain Babar Azam on Wednesday ended the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup Super League matches against South Africa as the No.1 ranked ODI batsman in the world, overtaking Indian skipper Virat Kohli.
			
Babar had moved ahead of Kohli to No.1 position after his 103 in the first match of the series. But, he slipped to second (five points behind Kohli) after scoring 31 in the second match. 
However, after an innings of 94 in the series finale that earned him the player of the match award, Babar has once again leapfrogged the India captain who has slipped from the top for the first time since replacing AB de Villiers in October 2017, a press release issued by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said.
Babar had started the three-match ODI series 20 points behind Kohli and finished eight points ahead of the India batsman, earning 28 points in the series in which he aggregated 228 runs.
Babar’s No.1 ODI ranking supplements his No.6 Test and No.3 T20I rankings, which is a hallmark of a fine batsman across all three formats. At present, Kohli is the only other batsman to feature inside the top six across all formats, the PCB said.
""Babar is the fourth Pakistani batsman after PCB Hall of Famers Zaheer Abbas and Javed Miandad, and Mohammad Yousuf to peak to the top in the ODI batting table,"" it added.
Reacting to the news, Babar Azam said: “I feel privileged and honoured to have joined the company of stalwarts like Abbas, Miandad and Yousuf, who will always be shining stars in Pakistani cricket.
“This is another milestone in my career, which will now require even more hard work and absolute consistency with the bat in order for me to hold on to the ranking for an extended period of time, like Sir Vivian Richards from January 1984 to October 1988 and Kohli for 1,258 days.
“I have also previously topped the T20I rankings, but the ultimate ambition and goal is to lead the Test rankings, which are the real testament and reward to a batsman’s calibre, reputation and skills. I understand that to achieve this objective, I will not only have to perform consistently, but more importantly, against the top sides,"" he said.
“I am looking forward to this challenge and remain confident I will be able to accomplish this target with the support of my teammates and coaching staff.
“But at this stage, I will savour the moment as it has come almost 18 months after I was first appointed the white-ball captain and that too at the back of my performances that helped Pakistan become the first Asian side to win two ODI series in South Africa,"" he said.
Meanwhile, Fakhar Zaman returned to the top 10 following a stellar series against South Africa in which he won the player of the series award, while Shaheen Shah Afridi was just outside the top 10 in the latest rankings.
Fakhar had scores of eight, 193 and 101, which helped the left-hander jump from 19th spot to seventh – his career-best ranking to date. His previous best ranking was eighth, which he had achieved following his 138 against England at Southampton in May 2019.
The opener had moved seven places to 12th after his swashbuckling 193 in the second match, while he was rewarded with a jump of five more places following his 101 in the series-decider.
Meanwhile, Shaheen achieved a career-high ranking of fifth. He took three for 58 in the final match of the series, which helped him to jump four places to 11th in the bowling table.
His previous highest-ranking was 14th, which he had achieved following his two for 61 in the first ODI against South Africa.
While Shaheen moved in an upward direction, Hasan Ali and Faheem Ashraf slipped in the latest rankings, which were updated following the third ODI.
Hasan dropped six places to 54th, while Faheem is now 57th after sliding three places. However, Mohammad Nawaz vaulted 29 places to 96th after his figures of three for 34 at Centurion–third ODI. ",Sport
"Bernie Madoff, architect of largest Ponzi scheme in history, dies at 82
","April 14, 2021","Bernard Madoff, who was convicted for running the largest known Ponzi scheme in history, died on Wednesday in federal prison where he was serving a 
, the Bureau of Prisons said. He was 82.
Madoff had been suffering from chronic kidney failure and several other medical ailments.
He had been held at a federal prison in Butner, North Carolina, after being sentenced in June 2009 to a 150-year term for engineering a fraud estimated as high as $64.8 billion.
Madoff’s thousands of victims, large and small, included individuals, charities, pension funds and hedge funds.
Among those he betrayed were the actors Kevin Bacon, Kyra Sedgwick and John Malkovich; baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Sandy Koufax; and a charity associated with director Steven Spielberg.
Owners of the New York Mets, longtime Madoff clients, struggled for years to field a good baseball team because of losses they suffered.
“We thought he was God. We trusted everything in his hands,” Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel, whose foundation lost $15.2 million, said in 2009.
Some victims lost everything. Many came from the Jewish community, where Madoff had been a major philanthropist.
Madoff’s crimes were revealed to authorities in 2008 by his two sons, who were not part of the scheme.
The fraud exposed holes at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which through incompetence or neglect botched a half-dozen examinations.
“There were several times that I met with the SEC and thought, ‘They got me,’” Madoff told lawyers in a prison interview, according to 
.
Madoff had been the largest market-maker on the Nasdaq, once serving as its non-executive chairman.
His brokerage firm was located in a Midtown Manhattan tower known as the Lipstick Building.
Employees there said they felt like part of Madoff’s family. They did not know he was running his fraud on a different floor. Only a trusted few did.
In a typical Ponzi scheme, money from newer investors is used to pay sums owed to earlier investors.
Madoff said his fraud began in the early 1990s, but prosecutors and many victims believe it started earlier.
Investors were entranced by the steady, double-digit annual gains that Madoff seemed to generate, and which others found impossible to explain or duplicate.
The money helped Madoff and his wife, Ruth, enjoy luxuries such as a Manhattan penthouse, a French villa and expensive cars and yachts, with a combined net worth of about $825m.
But no one from Madoff’s immediate family was in the Manhattan courtroom when US District Judge Denny Chin sentenced him.
And no family, friends or supporters submitted letters attesting to his good character or deeds in support of leniency.
“I believed when I started this problem, this crime, that it would be something I would be able to work my way out of, but that became impossible,” Madoff told the court. “As hard as I tried, the deeper I dug myself into a hole.”
Madoff also addressed victims in attendance, saying, “I am sorry. I know that doesn’t help you.”
Bernard Lawrence Madoff was born on April 29, 1938, in the New York City borough of Queens and grew up there as the son of European immigrants who ran a brokerage out of their house.
Madoff graduated from Hofstra University in 1960 and briefly attended Brooklyn Law School before quitting.
That same year, he started Bernard L Madoff Investment Securities, using his $500 in savings and office space borrowed from his father-in-law, Madoff told 
 magazine in 2011.
Madoff started small, selling penny stocks in the over-the-counter market. By the early 1970s, he had become one of the five original broker-dealers in the Nasdaq trading system.
Madoff advocated for greater market competition, at a time the New York Stock Exchange still dominated trading, and became an early force in electronic trading.
At times friendly and charming, and at others aloof, Madoff had a penchant for neatness that some viewed as an obsession.
Madoff’s offices were decorated in black and shades of gray, with little paperwork or objects visible on employee desks, and he coordinated several wedding rings with his wristwatches.
Market-making served Madoff well in the 1980s and 1990s, when he and his rivals could profit from buying a stock at $5 and selling it for $5.125, for example.
Profitability declined once decimalisation became standard, but Madoff’s brokerage operation provided financial support for his fraud.
Clients were told they would make money through a “split-strike conversion strategy”, in which Madoff would buy a basket of large stocks to mirror the Standard & Poor’s 100 index, and reduce risk by purchasing and selling options on that index.
Madoff looked successful, and customers were happy.
But it wasn’t real.
Prosecutors said Madoff and his staff sent clients fake confirmations for trades he never executed, and fake account statements to document gains he never made.
Madoff admitted to sometimes dipping into his account at JPMorgan Chase to pay customers who wanted their money back.
Suspicions began surfacing in the early 1990s, when Madoff’s name came up in a SEC probe of a now-defunct Florida accounting firm, Avellino & Bienes.
In 2001, a 
’s article noted scepticism on Wall Street about Madoff, including that he might be using his market-making operation to “smooth” returns for investors.
Madoff demurred. “It’s a proprietary strategy. I can’t go into it in great detail,” he said, while dismissing the 
’s theory as ridiculous.
More questions were raised as a whistleblower, financial analyst Harry Markopolos, began pressing the SEC to stop Madoff.
From 1992 to 2008, the SEC received six complaints raising “significant red flags” about Madoff and whether he was trading anything, but never took even basic steps to figure out what he was doing, its inspector general David Kotz later said.
It all came crashing down in the fall of 2008, as the global financial crisis struck and many investors demanded to cash out.
Unable to fulfill $7bn of redemption requests, Madoff confessed to sons Mark and Andrew that his investment advisory business was “one big lie”.
The sons went to the authorities and Madoff was arrested on December 11, 2008, one day after his company’s Christmas party. Three months later, he pleaded guilty to 11 criminal counts including fraud, money laundering and perjury.
Madoff initially maintained that the fraud was his alone, but prosecutors ended up winning 15 convictions or guilty pleas.
These included a guilty plea from Madoff’s younger brother Peter, the firm’s chief compliance officer, who received 10 years in prison. The only trial ended with convictions and prison terms for five former Madoff employees.
Prosecutors got a major boost after winning the cooperation of Frank DiPascali, Madoff’s longtime financial chief, who died in 2015 of lung cancer.
Ruth Madoff was not charged. She said she felt her husband had betrayed her after nearly a half-century of marriage. Many were sceptical of her claim she knew nothing about the fraud.
Prosecutors let Ruth Madoff keep $2.5m.
Within days of Madoff’s arrest, efforts began to try to recoup money for people who invested with him or with third parties that sent their money to his firm.
A large portion of these sums came from a $7.2bn settlement with the estate of Jeffry Picower, a longtime Madoff investor from Florida.
The pain for Madoff’s family did not end with the patriarch’s imprisonment.
Tormented by his father’s actions and by lawsuits, Mark Madoff, the older son, hanged himself with a dog leash at age 46 on Dec 11, 2010, the second anniversary of his father’s arrest.
In September 2014, Andrew Madoff died of cancer, at age 48.
As his health worsened, Madoff sought an early, “compassionate release” from prison.
Chin rejected that request in June 2020, agreeing with prosecutors that prison interviews where Madoff played down his crimes showed he “never fully accepted responsibility” for them.
In the 
 magazine article, Madoff made clear he believed he changed how Wall Street operated, and many victims might have lost more money in the markets had they not heard of him.
But he said he would not make excuses for his fraud and had come to terms with his crimes and pariah status.
“It is what it is,” he said.",World
"Opposition blasts govt over ‘illogical’ accord with TLP
","April 17, 2021","ISLAMABAD: The opposition on Friday lashed out at the government in the National Assembly for signing what it called an “illogical” 
 with the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) last year about expulsion of French ambassador from the country and severing of trade relations with France over its government’s stance on publication of blasphemous sketches in a magazine.  
The government, however, claimed it had never inked any agreement regarding expulsion of the ambassador. Rather, an understanding had been reached with the TLP that a resolution would be tabled in the assembly regarding removal of the ambassador.  
The agreement with the TLP, as reported by the media, read: “The government will take a decision from the Parliament regarding expulsion of the French ambassador within three months, will not appoint its ambassador to France and release all the arrested workers of the TLP. The government will not register any case against the TLP leaders or workers even after it calls off the sit-in.”  
In September 2020, French magazine 
 had republished blasphemous sketches of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) that triggered protests across the Muslim world. TLP was among the parties and groups that mounted protests in Pakistan over the issue.  
“When the government knew that it could not sever bilateral relations with France, then why such an agreement was signed with TLP,” asked Naveed Qamar of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) during a debate in the National Assembly.  
He said the government was thinking of moving the Supreme Court for dissolution of TLP, but the parliament was not being taken into confidence over the matter. “Nothing is being conveyed to the parliament,” he said.  
Mr Qamar asked whether decisions in the past to ban certain organisations had been implemented in letter and spirit. He said the interior minister should inform the house on details of the banned organisations and what action, if any, had been taken against them.   
Syed Imran Ahmed Shah of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) said the government should cut all sorts of relations with France and its ambassador should be sent back. “The maximum debt owed to France might be Rs17 billion to Rs18bn, which the lovers of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) could retire from their own pockets,” he remarked.  
Former prime minister and senior PML-N leader Shahid Khaqan Abbasi asked why the assembly’s proceedings lasted on an average for two hours only when the house could easily be asked to sit for four hours.  
Weighing in on the issue, Mr Qamar asked Speaker Asad Qaiser to hold consultations with all the parties in the parliament regarding timings of the sessions.  
Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-F’s member Salahuddin Ayubi was of the opinion that JUI-F could be banned just as TLP had been.  
During the debate, the opposition demanded that a committee be set up to deliberate on the objectives of establishing the TLP and who were behind the move.  
Riaz Pirzada of the PML-N said the members of the assembly should be informed who had formed two banned organisations, the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and Sipah-i-Sahaba Pakistan. “First a genie is created that later becomes a headache for its creators,” he added.  
On this, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Muhammad Ali Khan said the government had not signed any agreement that the French ambassador should be removed. “We just assured the TLP that a resolution will be tabled in the parliament in this regard,” he said.  
During talks with the government the TLP had insisted that the government should table a resolution of its (TLP’s) choice in the parliament, the minister added.",Pakistan

"Tokyo Olympics chief commits to Games as infections surge
","April 17, 2021","TOKYO: Tokyo’s Olympics chief said on Friday that Japan was committed to holding a safe Games this summer, as a surge in Covid-19 cases prompted an expansion of contagion controls and with fresh calls for the Games to again be postponed or cancelled. 
The government expanded quasi-emergency measures to 10 regions as a fourth wave of infections spread, casting more doubt on whether the Olympics can be held in Tokyo in fewer than 100 days. 
Organising committee president Seiko Hashimoto was asked at a news conference if there were any conditions under which the Olympics would be canceled. 
The question comes as the general secretary of ruling LDP political party, Toshihiro Nikai, raised the possibility the day before. 
“We’re not thinking of cancelling the Olympics,” Hashimoto said, speaking on behalf of the organising committee. “We will continue to do what we can to implement a thorough safety regimen that will make people feel complete safety.” 
Hashimoto acknowledged Nikai’s concern and suggested it was probably shared by the Japanese public. Polls show as many as 80 per cent in Japan oppose holding the Olympics during the pandemic. 
“The fact that he [Nikai] is concerned is a point that we need to take seriously as Tokyo 2020,” she said. “His comment has reminded us of how tedious it was for us to feel confident or be fully prepared for delivering the games.” 
The government added Aichi, Kanagawa, Saitama, and Chiba to six other prefectures already under contagion controls, including the cities of Tokyo and Osaka.
Japan’s top health experts have acknowledged that the Covid-19 pandemic has entered a fourth wave. 
Daily cases in Osaka reached a record 1,209 on Friday, driven by a virulent strain of the virus first identified in Britain. New infections in Tokyo were 729 on Thursday, the most since early February when most of the nation was under a state of emergency. 
Almost two-thirds of Japanese said the Olympics should be cancelled or postponed, a Jiji news poll showed on Friday.
A senior ruling party official said on Thursday that cancelling this year’s Olympics remains an option if the coronavirus situation becomes too dire. 
A scaled-back torch relay is already underway. Olympic organisers said on Friday that on the main island of Okinawa in Japan’s southernmost Okinawa prefecture they would stage the relay in restricted areas without spectators instead of on public roads.
Overseas fans have been barred from the Games and officials say that domestic fans may be kept out too. 
On Thursday, the government minister in charge of Japan’s vaccine rollout, Taro Kono, said even if the Olympics go on, there may be no fans of any kind in the venues. He said it’s likely that the Olympics will have to be held in empty venues, particularly as cases surge across the country. 
Hashimoto, who had said previously that a decision on venues would come in April, seemed to push back that deadline. She was not asked about Kono’s suggestion and did not raise the issue or challenge it. 
“Within April I would like to set the basis direction,” she said. “The final judgment time this as well we need to monitor the situation of the pandemic and we need to remain flexible for that.” 
Underscoring the difficulties of planning during the pandemic, Tokyo Olympic organisers postponed another test event, the BMX freestyle cycling scheduled for April 24-25, because of the impact on scheduling from the Covid-19 situation. 
Olympic and government officials have said further postponement of the Games is out of the question. 
But a groundswell of health experts have said it’s too risky to hold the Games this summer. Compounding the problem is Japan’s relatively slow inoculation push, which began February using imported vaccines. 
Japan has exhibited “poor performance” in containing virus transmission, along with limited testing capacity and a slow vaccination rollout, according to a commentary of health experts published in the British Medical Journal on Wednesday. 
“Plans to hold the Olympic and Paralympic games this summer must be reconsidered as a matter of urgency,” wrote lead author Kazuki Shimizu of the London School of Economics. 
“Holding Tokyo 2020 for domestic political and economic purposes--ignoring scientific and moral imperatives--is contradictory to Japan’s commitment to global health and human security.” 
Hashimoto said Japanese athletes were not a priority for vaccination. Putting athletes at the head of the line has been largely opposed in Japan. 
The IOC has said vaccination is not a requirement to participate in the Olympics. On the other hand, IOC President Thomas Bach has left no doubt he wants as many athletes vaccinated as possible. 
Japanese Olympic Minister Tamayo Marukawa told reporters on Friday that the government is considering conducting daily virus tests on athletes during the games as a way to guarantee safety. Previous plans had called for virus tests every four days. 
Marukawa also said the government was not talking about prioritising athletes for vaccination.",Newspaper
"PCB starts process of city associations head coaches’ appointment
","April 17, 2021","LAHORE: In the third phase of  the restructuring of the domestic set-up, the Pak­istan Cricket Board (PCB) is starting the process of appointing head coaches of 90 city associations from Sat­u­rday through advertisement.
After keeping shut the domestic structure for the last 18 months for apparently no solid reason, the PCB in the first phase formed the First Board of the six Provincial Cricket Association in February and in the second phase it has started the process of appointing the chief executive of the six associations.
And in the third phase the appointment of 90 head coaches to run 90 city associations is going to start. The process to appoint general manager and accounts managers for each provincial association is yet to start.
While PCB’s policy of closing down departmental cricket has left thousands of cricketers unemployed, the Board claims preference will be given to first-class and former International cricketers in the selection of 90 coaches, to again open opportunities for them to earn their livelihood from the game of cricket.
“The PCB today opened 90 head coach positions for the city cricket association sides. Following restructuring of the domestic structure, the PCB had promised to provide more job opportunities to former cricketers and this step comes at the back of the chief executives’ positions for the six Cricket Associations,” the PCB stated in a press release issued on Friday.
“Every coach will be responsible to run their city cricket association’s senior and U-19 teams. For the role, international and first-class cricketers would be preferred and those who have PCB Level-II coaching qualification are encouraged to apply for 12-month contracts, which is in line with the duration of tenures at the Cricket Association level.”
The PCB hopes the appointments of chief executives, general manager and account officers of the six provincial associations, besides 90 head coaches of the cities will be completed by the end of May this year.",Newspaper
"Policewoman arrested in occupied Kashmir for blocking search operation
","April 17, 2021","SRINAGAR: Police in occupied Kashmir said on Friday that they arrested one of their own officers and dismissed her for obstructing a counterinsurgency operation in the disputed region. 
The officer livestreamed a cordon and search operation by Indian forces in southern Frisal village on Wednesday with the intent of disrupting the search operation, police said in a statement. 
It said the officer resisted the search party, turned violent and made statements glorifying actions of Kashmiri fighters. She was arrested and fired, the statement said. 
The dismissed officer was a Special Police Officer. Such officials are lower-ranked personnel recruited mainly for counterinsurgency operations. 
Indian law enforcement officers repeatedly have been implicated in helping Kashmiri fighters, who for decades have waged an armed campaign demanding independence for their disputed region or a merger with Pakistan. 
When the latest armed campaign against Indian occupation began in 1989, police initially fought against it. But then many of the personnel began sympathising with the local fighters, who have massive public support. Dozens of them later joined the fighters, rising to become militant commanders. 
In several cases, the officers were accused of having ties with the fighters. In 1992, two policemen and a paramilitary soldier were arrested for allegedly helping fighters bomb Srinagar’s police headquarters in an attack that killed one officer and injured several others. 
In response, India set up a police counterinsurgency network that is widely feared and accused by many Kashmiris and human rights groups of abuses such as summary executions, torture, kidnappings and rape. It was those actions the officer may have been protesting against when she livestreamed the raid on Wednesday. 
Police said they are investigating if the woman has links with the fighters. 
Meanwhile, UN human rights experts have made public a communication to the Indian government in which they expressed concern over rights of people in Kashmir after New Delhi stripped the region’s semiautonomous status in 2019 and imposed a slew of administrative changes through new laws.",Newspaper
"New law to protect illegal residential schemes on green areas in Punjab
","April 17, 2021","LAHORE: Despite tall claims of the government to protect green areas, grave concerns expressed by the civil society over consumption of the agriculture land for commercial purposes and court orders against it, hundreds of illegal housing schemes/projects already developed or being established currently on green areas, including about 230 such schemes in Lahore and its adjoining districts, are likely to be legalised/approved under a recent ordinance promulgated in the province.
The move, it is alleged, is set to benefit the powerful land mafia, which succeeded in purchasing huge chunks of land in the green areas around Lahore and other divisions. The land mafia has developed or is in the process of developing housing schemes in violation of the land use rules and the cities’ master plans. After the promulgation of the ordinance, titled “The Punjab Commission for Regularization of Irregular Housing Schemes Ordinance-2021” on April 9, another related to squeezing the LDA’s jurisdiction to the Lahore city district alone from the entire division consisting four districts.
Lahore High Court Chief Justice Muhammad Qasim Khan on January 19 this year had directed the Lahore Development Authority (LDA) to stop all kinds of construction work in illegal housing schemes established on the agriculture land and suspend the amnesty being given to them.
“Not a single wall or window should be constructed in a society developed on the agricultural land,” the CJ had warned the legal adviser to the LDA.
“It seems to be a big game allegedly on the part of the government as first an ordinance to form a commission to regularise irregular housing schemes, including all those falling in green areas, was promulgated and then another came, clipping building control of the LDA and limiting it to the Lahore city alone,” said a private developer/builder.
“Everything is being done very quickly. It seems some very powerful people want illegal housing schemes—especially on the green areas, which cannot be legalised under the existing LDA and environmental laws, land use rules/regulations and the fundamental rights narrated in the constitution of Pakistan. Where is the PM who used to speak from time to time on protecting green areas of the country,” deplored the developer who requested not to be named.
“It is very strange that if you have money equaling 2pc of the residential land value, you can legalise the scheme falling in green areas,” he said.  
The Lahore High Court chief justice in recent hearings on various cases had also expressed grave concerns over the illegal housing schemes, especially those developed on green areas. The CJ had also reprimanded the LDA and other civic agencies, including the defunct town municipal administrations (TMAs), for not taking action against those involved in developing illegal schemes. At present, there are as many as 2,000 illegal housing schemes (developed or under-developing phase) in Punjab and most of them exist in major cities, including Lahore and its surroundings.
The Lahore division alone has over 600 illegal housing schemes and the number was 576 in January, this year. The 600 schemes include 230 developed or being established on green areas of Lahore, Kasur, Nankana Sahib and Sheikhupura districts in violation of the master plan, laws, rules and regulations.
According to the April 9 ordinance, the commission, headed by a retired judge of the high or supreme court shall have the power to hear the cases related to illegal schemes and regularise any non-conforming land use on which the irregular schemes exist.
Similarly, another ordinance was promulgated on April 12 to amend the Lahore Development Authority (LDA) Act, 1975 under which Sheikhupura, Kasur and Nankana Sahib are no longer part of the authority.
It was reportedly done on demand of provincial ministers, assembly members and the public who wanted limiting the powers of the LDA to Lahore only.
Talking to 
, LDA Vice Chairman S.M. Imran said most of the illegal housing schemes fell in the green areas where development of such projects was not allowed under the master plans and the housing schemes regulations, environment and other rules concerned.
“This matter came under discussion several times in courts since the LDA had no powers to approve or legalise them,” he explained.
He said the situation demanded finding a way out to at least look into the affairs of all illegal schemes and form a commission under the court directions.
“And finally, in line with the instructions, an ordinance was promulgated to form a commission to look into the affairs of such schemes, including the green area ones,” he added.
According to the ordinance, the illegal schemes developed/being developed on the non-conforming land (including green areas) can be regularised on the payment of fine of two per cent of the residential value as per applicable valuation table, followed by the schemes missing parks or open spaces, graveyards on the payment of fine of the amount equaling to two times of the value of deficient land or provision of land (graveyard) as an alternate. Similarly, the penalty for regularising the illegal schemes lacking public buildings or access road width etc has also been fixed in the ordinance.
“I am really worried to see what is happening in our country. On one hand, the government, in collaboration with the citizens, is working for the last one year or so on preparation of a regional plan and city master plans, but on the other hand, it also continues introducing such ordinances to legalise illegal schemes, including the ones on the green areas. It is so strange and irritating really,” deplored Kamil Khan Mumtaz, an eminent urban expert and civil society activist.
He said the government should have taken such steps in line with the guidance of the regional/master plans once they were finalised and approved accordingly.
Mr Mumtaz said the main issue the country had been facing was the implementation and rule of law. “When the people violate laws and develop such schemes or do another unlawful act, the institutions remain silent. And when they take action, the public sentiments emerge surprisingly, forcing the government to legalise the illegal acts,” he added.
While master plans are under preparation, the government, in addition to legalising the illegal schemes, had launched the Ravi Riverfront Urban Development Project to facilitate the influential and rich people earn more on the pretext of ‘public interest’, he said. “The government has also changed land use rules and started promoting construction of high rises, housing schemes’ rules etc. Whatever is going on at present is really worrisome,” Mr Mumtaz bemoaned.",Pakistan

","April 17, 2021","PESHAWAR: The Provincial Task Force on Covid-19 on Friday decided about the re-opening of all public and private schools and colleges from April 19 for in-person classes from grade 9 to 12 in view of the board examinations slated for next month.
However, the educational institutions will strictly follow the standard operating procedures issued by the government for the control and prevention of coronavirus.
The task force met here with Chief Minister Mahmood Khan in the chair.
The participants expressed serious concern about the increasing Covid-19 incidence in the province and called for strict implementation of SOPs and other precautionary measures against the virus.

"LHC censures Punjab govt for making people line up to buy sugar
","April 21, 2021","LAHORE: The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Tuesday censured the Punjab government for making citizens stand in long queues to buy sugar at subsidised rate at Ramazan bazaars.  
“The government has turned the people (into) beggars in the name of Rs15 discount on sugar price,” Justice Shahid Jamil Khan regretted while hearing petitions of sugar mills against the government’s decision of fixing the ex-mill price of the commodity at Rs80.  
The judge observed that making people stand in long queues for purchasing sugar was against their dignity and self-respect.  
He remarked that under Article 14 of the Constitution the dignity of man, subject to law, shall be inviolable.  
Since the dignity of a citizen was inviolable under the Constitution, therefore, lining up the people to purchase sugar at subsidised rate on any pretext was against command of the Constitution, the judge said.  
Justice Khan directed the government to discontinue the practice and ensure that the people got subsidised sugar without standing in long queues.  
The provincial law officer sought time to submit an undertaking on behalf of the government and the judge adjourned the hearing of the case till Wednesday.  
Earlier, the cane commissioner assured the court that sugar would be lifted from the mills through registered dealers.  
The judge ordered the cane commissioner to ensure that 155,000 metric tonnes of sugar was supplied to domestic consumers and the commodity was available on all retail shops.  
The cane commissioner told the court that the matter fell in the domain of director general of industries, who, when asked by the court, could not respond satisfactorily except by saying that all the concerned had been informed.  
The law officer said the industries department and all deputy commissioners were responsible for controlling the price of all commodities.  
The judge sought an undertaking in writing from the secretary, the director general of industries and the additional chief secretary on behalf of all deputy commissioners in Punjab that sugar being lifted as per the court order shall be available at Rs85 per kg in all retail outlets in the province.  The court had temporarily allowed the government to lift sugar from the mills at the rate of Rs80 per kg to meet the demand during the holy month of Ramazan.",Pakistan
"Govt may ban travellers from more countries after India
","April 21, 2021","ISLAMABAD: The National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) for Covid will meet again on Wednesday (today) to consider putting restrictions on the entry of passengers from more countries after slapping a ban on India to prevent spread of the Indian variant in Pakistan through any other country.
The NCOC will also take stock of the grim situation as the number of active cases in the country has already surpassed the 80,000 mark, while 137 deaths from the coronavirus were reported in a single day, increasing the death toll in less than three weeks to 1,923.
Currently, there is a ban on travellers from 23 high-risk countries to prevent the spread of deadly Covid variants, while people from as many as 20 countries are allowed to enter Pakistan without any Covid-related restriction. For travellers coming from all the other countries, a negative Covid-19 PCR test is mandatory before the travel date.
The NCOC in its last sitting was briefed about the spread of the new Indian variant (double mutant variant) — considered responsible for the present surge in cases in India — after which it decided to include India in the list of C-category countries for two weeks, prohibiting entry of inbound passengers from India via air and land routes. An official statement issued after the Monday meeting said: “In view of the presence of Indian virus in other countries, a review of category C countries will be carried out on Wednesday (April 21).”
As the body will meet again today to review the situation, some more countries are expected to be added to the C-category list to prevent spread of the Indian virus here through these countries. 
The virus has spread in a number of states of India and there is a high chance that it would reach Pakistan as both South Asian countries have huge passenger traffic with the UAE and some other countries, said University of Health Sciences (UHS) vice chancellor Prof Dr Javed Akram.
He said the Indian variant emerged in the state of Maharashtra, and so far five variations and two mutations — E484Q and L452R — had been reported in the virus.
The vice chancellor said the South African, Brazilian and UK variants were present in Pakistan but there was still no evidence about the prevalence of the Indian strain. He explained that variations came in virus when they rapidly multiplied or spread among people.
An official of the Ministry of National Health Services (NHS), requesting anonymity, said there was possibility that the Indian virus would arrive through Middle East, some Asian or European countries but it would not be easy to put them in the C-category list.
He explained that Pakistan had introduced three categories i.e. A, B and C to deal with Covid-19. “The countries in Category A are exempted from mandatory Covid-19 testing, countries in category B require a mandatory negative Covid-19 PCR test that has to be taken within 72 hours of the travel date, and the countries in category C are restricted and are only allowed as per guidelines by NCOC,” he said.
Australia, New Zealand, China, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Tajikistan and Vietnam are among the 20 countries in A-category list, while India, South Africa, Brazil, Zimbabwe and Venezuela are among the 23 countries currently in C category with complete restriction on the entry of travellers from there, the official elaborated.
All other countries were ranked in B category with the requirement of negative Covid test for travellers, he added.
According to the NCOC data released on Tuesday, 5,445 more cases and 137 deaths were reported in a day, bringing the tally of cases across the country so far to 766,882 and death toll to 16,453.
Currently, the data shows, there are 83,298 active cases in the country and 5,314 of these patients are hospitalised. 
A total of 549 Covid patients were on ventilators across the country on April 20, as the NCOC data shows that 80pc of all ventilators in Mardan, Multan, Gujranwala and Lahore have been occupied.",Pakistan

","April 21, 2021","KARACHI: Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah approved on Tuesday Rs17.7 billion to buy eight snorkels, fire tenders, refuse trucks, tractors and trolleys for Sindh’s local bodies.
He took this decision while presiding over a meeting here at CM House. The meeting was attended by Local Government Minister Nasir Husain Shah and relevant officials.
The local government department presented a proposal to purchase eight snorkels for extinguishing fires in high-rise buildings.
The chief minister was told that eight snorkels, each one 35 metres long, would be purchased for the divisional headquarters — three for Karachi, one each for the Hyderabad Municipal Corporation, Nawabshah, Sukkur, Mirpurkhas and Larkana divisions.
The local government minister told the chief minister that tenders for the purchase of snorkels had been floated. He added that the snorkels were needed for all divisional headquarters. At this the chief minister said that Rs1.5bn would be made available in the next financial year.
The LG minister further informed the meeting that the municipal committees had to transport garbage collected in their respective areas to their landfill sites, therefore, 102 tractors and trolleys were required and the purchase would cost Rs4.1bn.
The chief minister, in principle, approved the proposal and directed the finance department to make the amount available at the start of the next financial year.
The local government department presented another scheme for the purchase of 89 fire tenders for different municipal committees.

"Key ‘BLA man’ held in Saeedabad, AK-47 recovered
","April 21, 2021","KARACHI: The Sindh police on Tuesday claimed to have arrested a suspected militant belonging to the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) for his alleged involvement in facilitating a number of terrorist attacks and killing several people during his 10-year association with the proscribed outfit.
In a statement, the Counter-Terrorism Department said that a key BLA member, Asif Brohi alias Don, was arrested in a raid on his hideout in Saeedabad near Northern Bypass, which also led to the recovery of an AK-47 assault rifle.
“Asif Brohi alias Abdullah is not only the facilitator of several terrorist attacks but also a key man of the BLA,” said the CTD statement. “Investigators were closely monitoring the suspect and finally found his connection with several terrorist activities. Between 2011 and 2019, he killed six people in different Balochistan districts. He executed these jobs on the directives of BLA commander Shafiq ur Rehman Mengal. Apart from killing different individuals, he was actively involved in collecting extortion to raise funds for the banned outfit.”
The statement carried details of the suspect’s activities since 2012 saying he collected extortion amounting to Rs56.7 million from different businessmen and traders of Balochistan and in couple of instances he had even kidnapped his targets to get the ransom.
“Asif Brohi joined the BLA in 2009 after he was approached and convinced by Mohammad Bux Somlani — one of the key members of the banned organisation,” said the statement. “After joining the BLA, he was immediately sent to its centre for military training in Wadh, a town in Khuzdar district. Apart from his criminal and militant activities in Balochistan, he was also wanted in multiple cases of murders, extortion and kidnapping for ransom in Karachi,” it added.
The Anti-Vehicle Lifting Cell (AVLC) of the Sindh police on Tuesday claimed to have arrested six motorcycle thieves, adds PPI.

"NAB seeks approval to close inquiries against Chaudhrys
","April 21, 2021","LAHORE: The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) has filed a reference before an accountability court seeking final approval to close two inquiries initiated 20 years ago against PML-Q President Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain and Punjab Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Parvez Elahi. 
In January, the NAB had told the Lahore High Court (LHC) that the inquiries had been closed for want of evidence.  
The first inquiry against the families of Hussain and Elahi was related to the allegations of acquiring illegal assets. The second was against Elahi accusing him of making illegal appointments in local government departments. A third on charges of loan default against the duo had already been closed. 
The reference filed by NAB Lahore Director General Shahzad Saleem stated that the investigating officer recommended that the inquiries against Hussain and Elahi be closed as no trial-worthy material or evidence surfaced during the course of investigation. It said the NAB chairman had already recommended the closure of the inquiries in light of investigating officer’s reports.  
The court would resume hearing on April 26 when NAB Special Prosecutor Asadullah Awan would advance his arguments in favour of the closure of the inquiries. 
The Chaudhry brothers had challenged the inquiries against them before the LHC alleging that the NAB had been used for political engineering.  
At a hearing in December, the court had expressed concern over the pendency of the inquiries for 20 years and ordered the NAB to conclude them within four weeks.  
The PML-Q leaders had pleaded that all the inquiries against them had been recommended for closure by the investigating officers and the NAB regional board during 2017 and 2018.  
However, they said, NAB Chairman retired Justice Javed Iqbal approved reinvestigation and bifurcation of the inquiries against them after 20 years. They asked the court to set aside the authorisation of the inquiries and the order for their bifurcation for being unlawful.  
In its replies to the petition of the Chaudhrys, the NAB had previously accused them of committing money laundering and accumulating illegal assets.",Pakistan
"UK Covid-19 variant found in 50pc of positive cases in Karachi: Sindh health minister
","April 21, 2021","Sindh Health Minister Dr Azra Pechuho said on Wednesday that 50 per cent of the samples in a Covid-19 genomic study conducted in Karachi were confirmed to be of the UK coronavirus variant. 
In a 
 released on Twitter, Pechuho said that the UK variant ""spreads very rapidly"" and it had already spread in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab as a result of which ""a lot of deaths are occurring and a lot of patients are being affected."" 
""This variant has entered Karachi as well and the UK variant was found in 50pc of the samples we tested in the genomic studies we did,"" she said, adding that because of that, there was need to take ""great precautions"" against the coronavirus. 
Pechuho said that it was the month of Ramazan and Eidul Fitr was coming up so there was ""need for great care"" when visiting the markets during Sehri and Iftar and for Eid shopping. 
""Follow SOPs (standard operating procedures), don't unnecessarily venture out, avoid crowds, keep washing hands with soap and water, wearing a mask is very important and maintain social distancing. 
""This way you can protect yourself, your family members, your relatives and other people in the community from this disease,"" she said. 
She said that vaccination centres would remain open after Iftar and urged people to get themselves vaccinated to protect against Covid-19.

 had analysed 3,501 positive samples and found that the UK, South African and Brazilian variants were responsible for causing 54pc of the new Covid-19 infections reported from December 2020 to February 2021 in Karachi.
According to the study, the positivity ratio in the months of September to November 2020 was 1.538pc, which jumped to 7.6pc in December 2020 to February 2021.
Dr Rafiq Khanani, a senior pathologist and president of the Infection Control Society of Pakistan, had conducted the study with colleagues Dr Muhammad Hanif and Dr Adnan Dinar, both molecular biologists. 
“Unmonitored international flights and no quarantine on arrival in Pakistan from any country seemed to have led to a rapid introduction of the variants in Pakistan,” Dr Khanani had explained, adding that the spread of the pandemic globally provided an opportunity to variable strain types to thrive.
The analysis had found the UK variant in 944 samples and Brazilian and South African variants (together) in 934 samples. There were 1,623 cases of old viral infection.
Experts at Karachi University’s National Centre for Virology had also detected the South African variant along with the UK variant in the samples tested at the facility.
“Around 50pc of the positive cases tested at the facility involved the UK variant while 25pc were the South African variant. There is a need for genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 to timely identify and contain the rapidly emerging new strains of the virus,” said Professor Mohammad Iqbal Choudhary, director of the International Centre for Chemical and Biological Sciences at KU.

","April 21, 2021","Recently appointed Minister for Industries and Production Khusro Bakhtiar has written a letter to Prime Minister Imran Khan, asking him to transfer the Sugar Advisory Board (SAB) to another ministry to avoid ""any possible perceived conflict of interest that may arise"" and to allow the body to function without ""public objections"", it emerged on Wednesday. 
In a letter dated April 16, a copy of which is available with 
, Bakhtiar started out by thanking the premier for making him the minister of industries and production, terming it a ""great honour"". 
The minister added that he was conscious of the ""serious responsibility"" his position placed on him. 
""Given the importance of sugar as a commodity in Pakistan and in light of the recent public concerns in respect of the same, it is imperative that the functions of SAB are not perceived as serving any interests besides those of the people of Pakistan,"" he wrote. 
""Keeping in view any possible perceived conflict of interest that may arise and in order to ensure that SAB is allowed to operate without public objections, I hereby request that the SAB be transferred to another ministry of the federal government.""
Bakhtiar said the matter of the SAB was ""imperative to the integrity"" of his portfolio and the independent functioning of the body.
A notification issued by the Prime Minister's Office dated April 19 stated that the premier had received Bakhtiar's letter. 
""The prime minister has seen and while agreeing to the request of the minister for industries and production, in principle, has been pleased to desire that Industries and Production Division shall, in consultation with the stakeholders concerned, move a summary for transfer of the Sugar Advisory Board to the appropriate ministry/division, at the earliest,"" it read. 
The minister's appointment had been 
 with PPP Senator Mian Raza Rabbani terming it a ""direct conflict of interest"" because of Bakhtiar and his family members' involvement in the sugar industry as mentioned in the

Rabbani regretted that Bakhtiar had been given the important portfolio exactly one year after his

""Bakhtiar was removed as the minister for national food security [for] having a conflict of interest in the light of the report of the sugar commission. How [does] the conflict disappear in the ministry of industries and production which, in fact, has a direct link with the sugar industry?"" questioned Rabbani.

"Israeli jets hit targets in Gaza Strip after missile attacks
","April 25, 2021","JERUSALEM: Israeli warplanes struck the Gaza Strip early on Saturday after repeated salvos of rocket fire into Israel followed a second night of clashes between Palestinians and police in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem. 
Thirty-six rockets were launched, the Israeli army said, the most in a single night this year, after Gaza’s Islamist rulers Hamas voiced support for the east Jerusalem protests, which were fuelled by a Thursday march by far-right Jews. 
Washington said it was “deeply concerned” by the escalating violence, while the European Union appealed for restraint.  
Tensions have been running high in east Jerusalem over a ban on gatherings, and a series of videos posted online showing young Arabs attacking ultra-Orthodox Jews, and Jewish extremists taking to the streets to bully Arabs. On Thursday, at least 125 people were injured when Palestinian protesters, ang­ered by chants of “death to Arabs” from far-right Jewish demonstrators, cla­shed repeatedly with police. 
Skirmishes broke out again on Friday when tens of thousands of Muslim worshippers left the city’s revered Al Aqsa mosque compound after night prayers and found themselves confronted by dozens of armed police, some on horseback. 
Protesters hurled water bottles at police, who fired stun grenades to disperse the crowd. 
Hundreds of Palestinians also gathered at the Qalan­diya checkpoint between Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank, police said. 
There have been nightly disturbances in east Jerusalem since the start of Ramazan on April 13, amid Palestinian anger over police blocking off access to the promenade around the walls of the Old City, a popular gathering place after the end of the fast. 
Hamas’s military wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, voiced support for the east Jerusalem protesters. “The spark you light today will be the wick of the explosion to come in the face of the enemy,” it said in a statement. 
An alliance of Palestinian militant groups, including Hamas and its smaller ally Islamic Jihad, issued a statement warning we “cannot remain silent” in the face of the violence. 
Militants in Gaza fired a first salvo of three rockets at Israel shortly before midnight on Friday, the military said. The Israeli army said later that all 36 rockets fired were intercepted or hit open ground. 
Israeli tanks shelled Gaza in response but the reprisals were met with a new volley of a dozen rockets, prompting the launch of air strikes against suspected launch sites operated by Hamas, it added.",Newspaper
"Action taken against 57 private medical, dental colleges
","April 25, 2021","ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Medi­cal Commission (PMC) has taken act­ion against 57 private medical and dental colleges for violation of admission regulations after receiving hundreds of complaints against 69 institutions. 
Some of the colleges had admitted students against merit while others had not mentioned the marks of interview. Also, some colleges had admitted students before even displaying merit list and others had received fee of all the five years in advance. 
To address these violations, admissions to some of the colleges will be re-advertised so that merit is followed while others have been directed to return overcharged fees, according to PMC vice president Ali Raza. 
A PMC official told Dawn that complaints had been received against 69 colleges, but applications against three of them were rejected. “As many as 66 colleges were placed in three categories, the first category was for minor issues and the third was for major irregularities. As it involved multiple levels of inquiry, nine colleges addressed issues and action has been taken against 57 colleges,” he explained. 
After receiving the complaints, the PMC had placed the offending private colleges in three categories: suspension of admissions (category-I), cancellation of admissions (category-II) and refund of excessive fee (category-III), and issued orders accordingly. 
While addressing a presser on Saturday, PMC Vice President Ali Raza said: “Twenty eight colleges were issued order in the first category, 36 colleges in the second and two colleges faced action in the third category. The private colleges were instructed to take punitive measures to rectify their violations.  
“Twenty two colleges in the first category did not display interview marks and/or [merit] lists before the admissions. These colleges had asked for fee deposits before displaying merit lists and prioritised students with strong financial backgrounds. Students with low merit who had deposited fee were given higher marks in interviews during the admission process. Lastly, these colleges conducted same interview for MBBS and BDS admissions,” he said. 
“Four colleges in the first category did not display their merit lists in accordance with PMC admission regulations. Students were given a maximum of three working days’ time from January 26 to February 2, 2021 to deposit the fee. Failure in doing so resulted in the cancellation of their slot. Also, two colleges in the first category had adopted their own admission process [instead of PMC admission regulations]. They had initiated admissions before the PMC national merit list was issued. Their list did not show PMC merit and PMC standing. Even though the colleges had followed the formula of 50pc MDCAT and 30pc FSC marks, the figure is not exactly the same as shown in the PMC merit list,” the vice president elaborated. 
Mr Raza said PMC would advertise admissions for the colleges again so that PMC merit was followed. However, he said, “The cost of advertisement for this re-admission process shall be borne by the colleges. The lowest merit on the college’s admission list will be 80pc of the total marks according to the admission criteria of PMC. Students who did not get admission to the college will be notified to apply within five days after the advertisement is published. If the student fulfils the criteria, they shall be given two days to deposit the annual fee of the college to accept the admission. If any student is admitted to the college through this process, the admission of the student at the lowest merit shall stand cancelled.”",Pakistan
"Smuggled goods offer respite to consumers
","April 25, 2021","KARACHI: Smuggled low-priced Iranian goods provide some relief to consumers amid high rates of local and imported items. 
A huge potential for Iranian products – particularly packaged food and confectionery items – exists in Pakistan. However, sanctions on Iran by the United States coupled with lack of banking channels and other trade bottlenecks are the main hurdles in boosting legal trade between Iran and Pakistan. 
Stakeholders also appear a bit reluctant about revealing whether the arrival of Iranian goods is via legal or illegal channels. 
While counting on some price relief, commodity importer and former president of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) Haroon Agar said a 25kg pack of Iranian powdered milk carries the price tag of Rs9,000-9,500 per bag as compared to Rs17,000-18,000 of one from the US. 
“Confectionery makers are the main buyers of Iranian powdered milk,” he added.
He said Iranian chemicals are cheaper by 15-20 per cent than other foreign brands while dried fruit especially pistachios, almonds and some spices, also cost 15-20pc lower than those from other countries.
“Majority of trade with Iran can be termed as informal as most of the trade is based at the border and on cash. One container is cleared by giving duties while five to 10 containers are cleared without paying any duty and taxes,” Mr Agar said, adding that the government is not getting any revenue through duties and taxes.
He claimed that confectionery items literally rule Balochistan markets. Iranian goods are finding their way into Pakistan via the Taftan border.
Talking to 
, Member of the All Pakistan Fast Moving Consumers Goods Association (APFMCGA) Mansub Abrar said Iranian chips, biscuits, cakes and other confectionery items are available at 20-25 per cent less prices compared to locally made or imported items. 
However, there is no major price difference between Iranian dates and Pakistani dates. Iranian dates sell at Rs300-350 per kg.
Mr Abrar said Iranian cheese is also arriving in the country which is almost 50pc cheaper than Pakistani-made cheese and other imported varieties.
Senior Vice Chairman of the Chainstore Association of Pakistan (CAP) Asfandyar Farrukh said: “There is duty and taxes savings of 40-60pc in different Iranian products landing in Pakistan depending on the items as no regulatory duty, additional customs duty, sales tax, income tax, etc are paid.”
Central Chairman of the All Pakistan Petroleum Retailers Association (APPRA) Sameer Najmul Hussain said Iranian diesel and petrol have been openly selling on the outskirts of Karachi and in many areas of the city like Metrovelle, Baldia, Hub, etc.

","April 25, 2021","MONTREAL: Hayley Wickenheiser, a Canadian member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Athletes Commission, says medical experts should decide whether or not to stage the Tokyo Olympics, not athletes or the IOC.
Wickenheiser, a six-time Olympian who won four ice hockey gold medals and also played softball at the 2000 Summer Games, told 
 that safety and public health need to be the decisive factors about conducting the Games at Japan in July and August.
“This decision needs to be made by medical and health experts, not by corporate and big business,” Wickenheiser said in a posting on the 
 website.
“A very clear and transparent explanation needs to be given if the Games are going to go ahead.”
Wickenheiser knows the money, preparation and training that has gone into the planned staging of the Games in Tokyo, which is now under  ‘emergency orders’ due to the Covid-19 pandemic that forced the postponement of the Olympics from last year.
Wickenheiser knows after training for years to compete, she would do anything to go, so athletes, and the IOC, shouldn’t make the final choice on the Games’ fate.
“You almost need someone else outside with less invested than you to say it is or isn’t worth it,” she said. “It shouldn’t be the IOC making that call. That should be the experienced doctors and physicians who have dealt with pandemics and people with no skin the game and nothing to gain or lose from this.”
Wickenheiser wants public safety, not television deals and sponsor bonuses, to be the critical factor.
“This is what it’s all about. Money and broadcast rights and promises made,” she said.  “I question if the health and the well-being of the athletes attending has been at the true forefront. I have to ask that question because it wasn’t when the Games were first postponed.”
Wickenheiser went on social media in March 2020 and said it would be irresponsible and insensitive for the Tokyo Olympics to be staged as planned.
Five days later, Canada’s Olympic Committee said it wouldn’t send athletes to Tokyo that summer and two days later, the Olympics were postponed.
Canada is facing a new wave of Covid-19 variants and again Wickenheiser wonders whether it’s safe to stage an Olympics, even one without international spectators.
“I have to ask the questions and I think they’re fair questions,” she said. “Prior to the pandemic I said there’s no way the Olympics can go ahead because history told us there was no way they could.
“And now I’m saying I don’t know, I wonder if they can again.”",Newspaper
"Asean leaders say consensus reached on ending Myanmar crisis
","April 25, 2021","JAKARTA: Southeast Asian leaders said they had agreed on a plan with Myanmar’s junta chief on Saturday to end the crisis in the violence-hit nation, but he did not explicitly respond to demands to halt the killing of civilian protesters.
“It’s beyond our expectation,” Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin told reporters after the leaders’ meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) that was also attended by Myanmar’s Senior General Min Aung Hlaing.
“We tried not to accuse his side too much because we don’t care who’s causing it,” Muhyiddin added.  “We just stressed that the violence must stop. For him, it’s the other side that’s causing the problems. But he agreed that violence must stop.”  Asean leaders wanted a commitment from Min Aung Hlaing to restrain his security forces, who an activist monitoring group says have killed 745 people since a mass civil disobedience movement erupted to challenge his Feb 1 coup. They had also wanted the release of political prisoners.
“He did not reject what was put forward by me and many other colleagues,” Muhyiddin said.
According to a statement from group chair Brunei, a consensus was reached on five points — ending violence, a constructive dialogue among all parties, a special Asean envoy to facilitate the dialogue, acceptance of aid and a visit by the envoy to Myanmar. There was no mention of releasing political prisoners in the statement.
“He said he (Min Aung Hlaing) heard us, he would take the point in, which he considered helpful,” Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong told reporters.
“He was not opposed to Asean playing a constructive role, or an Asean delegation visit, or humanitarian assistance.”  But Lee added the process had a long way to go,  “because it is one thing to say you will cease violence and release political prisoners, it is another thing to get it done”.
It was not clear why Lee referred to the release of political prisoners when this was not in the consensus statement. There was no immediate comment from Min Aung Hlaing.
A regular nighttime news bulletin on the military-run Myawaddy TV reported his attendance of the meeting and said Myanmar would closely cooperate with Asean on various issues, including  “the political transition in Myanmar, and the process that will be implemented in the future”.
Charles Santiago, head of the Asean Parliamentarians for Human Rights group, called for the release of Myanmar’s political prisoners and a timeline for an end to violence.
“Asean must now act swiftly and set a clear timeline for Min Aung Hlaing to deliver on ending the violence, or stand ready to hold him accountable,” he said.
The gathering was the first coordinated international effort to ease the crisis in Myanmar, an impoverished country that neighbours China, India and Thailand, since the coup that overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi’s elected government. Myanmar is part of the 10-nation Asean, which has a policy of consensus decision-making and non-interference in the affairs of its members.
Myanmar’s parallel National Unity Government (NUG), comprised of pro-democracy figures, remnants of Suu Kyi’s ousted administration and representatives of armed ethnic groups, said it welcomed the consensus reached but the junta had to be held to its promises.
“We look forward to firm action by Asean to follow up its decisions and to restore our democracy,” said Dr. Sasa, spokesman for the NUG. It was unusual for the leader of a military government in Myanmar to attend an Asean summit — usually the country has been represented by a lower-ranked officer or a civilian.",Newspaper
"Swat valley most venerable place for Buddhists, say Lankan monks
","April 25, 2021","SWAT: Sri Lankan Buddhist monks said here on Saturday that the paradisiacal Swat valley remained the centre of Buddhism and had immense importance for Buddhists all over the world. 
They said this during their visit to the Buddhist archaeological sites of Gandhara Buddhist civilisation in Swat valley. 
The delegation include senior monks Dr Walpole Piyananda, Dr Bodagama Chandima, Dr Assaji Thero, Dr Pallegama Rathanasara, Prof Kallanchiye Rathanasiri, Uduwe Dhammaloka, Muruththettuwe Ananda, Embilipitiye Rahula, Korathota Dammadassi, Dr Atapattukande Ananda, Asela Pushpa Kumara Wickramasinghe and Aaishah Abu Bakr Fahad, who is Second Secretary (political) at Pakistan High Commission, Colombo. 
The monks said that Swat valley had high importance for Buddhists and its name meant a blessing. 
“Swat is also important for us as both the Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism started from here and spread into Southeast Asia. 
It is also the place where most venerable monks like Padmasambhava were born and spread Vajrayana Buddhism to Tibet, Bhutan and other countries of Southeas Asia,” said Dr Walpole Piyananda. 
However, he said that people in Sri Lanka were afraid to go to Pakistan because of certain media reports and he himself was hesitant at first. 
“When we came here and saw the love and respect of the local people, we became very happy and now we send the message to all the Buddhists to come and visit Pakistan,” he said. 
Asela Pushpa Kumara Wickramasinghe, the coordinator officer, said the monks were hesitant to visit Pakistan because of the wrong image developed through media, but thanks to the Pakistan High Commission which not only assured them but also arranged the visit. 
“People are amazingly helpful and hospitable here and when I saw their love with us it erased the wrong image of Pakistan from our minds and hearts,” he said, adding he and the tourism minister of Pakistan discussed a tourism plan between both the countries. 
Aaishah Abu Bakr Fahad said that during recent visit of Prime Minister Imran Khan to Sri Lanka he invited the Buddhist monks to Pakistan, so the Pakistan High Commission in Colombo organised the visit. 
“We tried to take the delegation to the proposed Buddhist Trail and we hope that through this not only people-to-people contacts between Pakistan and Sri Lanka will strengthen, but the religious tourism will also increase from Sri Lanka to Pakistan,” she said, adding it was also aimed at showing the true and peaceful image of Pakistan to the world.",Pakistan

"Top US commander in Afghanistan says steps to end military mission launched
","April 25, 2021","The commander of foreign forces in Afghanistan, US Army Gen Scott Miller, on Sunday said an orderly withdrawal of foreign forces and the handing over of military bases and equipment to the Afghan forces had begun.
Miller said he was acting on orders based on US President Joe Biden's 
 to end America's longest war, deeming the prolonged and intractable battle in Afghanistan no longer aligned with American priorities.
Earlier this month Biden said he would withdraw troops from Afghanistan before September 11, the 20th anniversary of the militant attacks on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon that launched the Afghan war.
Miller, who has been commanding the US forces and the Nato Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan in their fight against the Taliban and other militant groups since 2018, said foreign forces will continue to have “the military means and capability to fully protect themselves during the ongoing retrograde and will support the Afghan security forces”.
“I've had the opportunity to talk to Taliban members with the Taliban Political Commission, and I've told them a return to violence, an effort to force a military decision, would be a tragedy for Afghanistan and the Afghan people,” Miller told reporters in the capital Kabul.
The Taliban ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, when they were ousted by US-led forces. Since then they have waged a long-running insurgency and now control wide swathes of territory.
Security experts in recent weeks said they doubt if the Taliban will allow US forces, whom they call invaders, to peacefully exit the country at a time when clashes between the Afghan forces and the Taliban have not ebbed.
Foreign force withdrawal is slated to begin on May 1, in line with an agreement with the Taliban in 2020.
“As we retrograde to zero US forces, we will turn over the [military] bases primarily to the [Afghan] Ministry of Defence and other Afghan forces,” Miller said, adding that the Taliban have committed to break their relationship with Al Qaeda.
The Taliban government's sheltering of Al Qaeda was the key reason for the US invasion of Afghanistan after the September 2001 attacks.
A United Nations report in January said there were as many as 500 Al Qaeda fighters in Afghanistan and that the Taliban maintained a close relationship with them. The Taliban deny Al Qaeda presence in Afghanistan.",World

"23 dead, dozens hurt as elevated metro collapses in Mexico
","May 5, 2021","			
MEXICO CITY: Emergency services on Tuesday worked to retrieve the bodies of victims from the wreckage of an elevated metro line that collapsed in the Mexican capital, leaving at least 23 dead and dozens injured.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised a full investigation into Monday night’s accident, which raised questions about construction standards on a network used by millions every day.
Carriages were seen hanging from the metro overpass in the south of the capital in a tangle of twisted cables with the ends pointing towards the ground in a V-shape.
Several minors were among the 23 dead, Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum told reporters.
Four of the victims were still in the train, she added.
Nearly 80 others received hospital treatment following the dramatic accident, one of the worst to strike the Mexico City metro since it was inaugurated in 1969.
Earlier, anxious relatives had gathered at the site awaiting news of those believed to have been aboard the train.
Efrain Juarez said that his son was in the wreckage.
“My daughter-in-law called us. She was with him and she told us the structure fell down over them,” he told AFP.
Another man who did not give his name said that his brother was among those trapped.
“He came with his wife and they managed to get her out, but he was crushed there and we don’t know anything,” he said.
Dozens of emergency workers were seen trying to rescue victims from the carriages.
The work had to be suspended because of fears the wreckage was too unstable, but it later resumed with the help of a crane.
A car was trapped under the rubble, but a person inside managed to get out alive, Sheinbaum said.
The police, who brought rescue dogs, urged onlookers to move back in case of falling debris.
“Suddenly I saw that the structure was shaking,” an unidentified witness told the Mexican television network Televisa.
“When the dust cleared we ran... to see if we could help. There were no screams. I don’t know if they were in shock,” she added.
Medics were seen taking the injured away on stretchers.
The casualties were rushed to different hospitals in the city, Sheinbaum said.
She promised a structural examination of the affected metro line, which will remain closed, and a full investigation into the causes of the accident.
“We will report the whole truth. Our support to all victims,” Sheinbaum tweeted.
The metro line that partially collapsed was built while Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard, a close ally of Lopez Obrador, was mayor of the capital from 2006-2012.",Newspaper
"G7 seeks common front against China
","May 5, 2021","LONDON: The Group of Seven wealthy democracies on Tuesday discussed how to form a common front towards an increasingly assertive China in the foreign ministers’ first in-person talks in two years.
Backing US President Joe Biden’s calls for a deeper alliance of democracies, host Britain invited guests, including India, South Korea and Australia, for talks in central London stretched out over three days.
After a welcome dinner on Monday focused on the nuclear programmes of Iran and North Korea, the foreign ministers opened formal talks at Lancaster House, a West End mansion, welcoming one another with Covid-friendly elbow-bumps and minimal staff.
The G7 devoted its first session on Tuesday to China, whose growing military and economic clout, and willingness to exert its influence at home and abroad have increasingly unnerved Western democracies.
“It is not our purpose to try to contain China or to hold China down,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters on Monday.
“What we are trying to do is to uphold the international rules-based order that our countries have invested so much in over so many decades to the benefit, I would argue, not just of our own citizens, but of people around the world — including, by the way, China.” Blinken pledged “robust cooperation” with Britain in pressuring China over the Xinjiang region, where Beijing’s incarceration of one million Uyghurs and other Muslims has been labelled genocide by Washington, and over a clampdown against civil rights in Hong Kong.
British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab called for “holding Beijing to the commitments that they’ve made”, including on Hong Kong, which was promised a separate system before London handed over the colony in 1997.
But in line with the Biden administration, which has shifted the tone if not substance of former president Donald Trump’s hawkish stance on China, Raab also called for “finding constructive ways to work with China in a sensible and positive manner where that’s possible” — including on climate change.
“We want to see China stepping up to the plate and playing its full role,” Raab said.
The nations of the G7 — which also include Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan — mostly share concerns about China but some have different approaches.
Japan has historic tensions with China but has held off on joining Western nations with sanctions, wary of inflaming relations with its giant neighbour and trading partner.
Italy has been seen as one of the most Beijing-friendly nations in the West, in 2019 signing up for China’s massive infrastructure-building Belt and Road Initiative.
But Rome joined EU peers in March in summoning the Chinese ambassador in a row triggered by concerns over treatment of the Uyghurs.
Russia, Myanmar, Libya, Syria and climate change are among other issues on the formal agenda for the foreign ministers.
Blinken will head on Wednesday to Ukraine in a show of support after Russia last month amassed and then pulled back 100,000 troops in border regions and Crimea. The G7 is laying the groundwork for a leaders’ summit in Cornwall, southwest England, next month, in what will be Biden’s first foreign trip as president.
They will also discuss Ethiopia, Somalia, the Sahel and western Balkans in what London said were “pressing geopolitical issues that threaten to undermine democracy, freedoms and human rights”.
“The UK’s presidency of the G7 is an opportunity to bring together open, democratic societies and demonstrate unity at a time when it is much needed to tackle shared challenges and rising threats,” Raab said.
Ministers are meeting under strict coronavirus protocols, with stripped-back delegations and social distancing, including face-masks and perspex screens between speakers.
Britain, which has seen more than 127,500 deaths in the outbreak, is gradually easing virus restrictions as vaccinations increase and cases fall, even as other countries such as India and Brazil endure fresh spikes.",Newspaper
"PPP voices concern over rising inflation
","May 5, 2021","ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) has expressed concern over record rate of inflation in the country and slammed the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government for not taking parliament into confidence on its plan to have renegotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
In a statement issued here on Tuesday, PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari pointed out that the monthly inflation had reached 11.1 per cent and the annual inflation rate 14.1pc. Moreover, according to the Wholesale Price Index, the inflation rate has reached 16.6pc while, according to the Sensitive Price Index, the inflation rate has risen to 21.3pc.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari alleged that the government had unleashed a maelstrom of inflation and to add insult to injury there seemed to be no intent to decrease inflation and ease the burden on the working class.
“How can a country survive economically when it imports sugar and flour while producing wheat and sugarcane in abundance?” he wondered.
“People have been squeezed dry trying to survive this unbearable inflation under the selected government, while Imran Khan’s regime is adamant on not listening to anything but sycophantic praise for the puppet prime minister,” he said.
The PPP leader said the Sindh government was trying to heal the wounds of inequality of the poor by issuing Benazir Mazdoor Card in these days of spiraling inflation.
“History will bear witness that when Imran Khan was wreaking havoc through increasing inflation, poverty and unemployment, the PPP [government in Sindh] was employing innovative ideas to provide relief to the common man through limited resources available to it,” he said.
“The puppet prime minister cannot handle the increase in prices of staples such as potato, onion and tomato, while the cost of oil, ghee, sugar, flour, pulses, fruits, vegetables and meat has also skyrocketed. Name a single commodity which has not registered an unprecedented increase in price during this selected government,” he concluded.
Meanwhile, PPP’s parliamentary leader in the Senate Sherry Rehman said in a separate statement that they had heard that the government was thinking to renegotiate with the IMF, but regretted that parliament was under dark on the issue.
“After telling them all along that these [power] tariff hikes are unjustified, now we hear that the government is thinking to renegotiate the IMF agreement. We have been saying the exact thing but were always told by U-turn Sarkar (government) that they are on the right track. As always, parliament has not been taken on board on any policy, either now or earlier. What exactly is their plan?” she asked. Ms Rehman issued the statement a day after newly appointed Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin told a National Assembly committee that the IMF would be convinced to relax its conditions, particularly those related to power tariff hike.
Mr Tarin had reportedly said that the higher power tariff was leading to corruption and badly affecting the economic growth, adding that the conditions agreed to under the IMF programme were very harsh.
Sherry Rehman said that for the last two years the per unit price of electricity had gone up by 200pc and now finally the government had woken up to realise that the increase in the tariff was unreasonable.
“Are they going to compensate people for all the jobs lost and the families destroyed?” she asked.
The PPP senator said that if the government had already agreed with the IMF to increase petroleum levy from Rs510 billion to Rs607bn in 2022 and raise gas tariff by an additional Rs100bn, then how did it plan on controlling inflation in the country.
“Since day one, we warned the PTI government that IMF’s policies would burden the poor but no one paid any heed. Now, after leaving Pakistan’s economy on the ventilator, overburdening the masses with back to back tariff and taxes, the PTI government realises that IMF’s tariffs are unjustifiable. We have never seen anything like this before in the past,” she said.",Pakistan
"Provinces told to rationalise expenditure
","May 5, 2021","ISLAMABAD: With plan to present Budget 2021-22 in parliament on June 11, the federal government on Tuesday asked the provinces to adopt strict fiscal discipline, rationalise expenditure and divert savings towards socioeconomic development.
As part of budget-making exercise, the centre also asked the provinces to rationalise their workforce in view of rising salary and pension bills, improving revenues and harmonise tax structure. The meetings were part of an overall consultative process with key stakeholders including provinces to seek inputs for formulation of a “people friendly growth-oriented budget”, the Ministry of Finance said.
On its part, the federal government decided to seek international financial support for agriculture package, water sector and social protection as part of foreign exchange component of the upcoming budget.
In his separate meetings with finance ministers of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin asked both the provinces to rationalise their expenditures.
Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Finance and Revenue Dr Waqar Masood Khan and Secretary Finance Kamran Ali Afzal also attended the meetings.
As part of the IMF programme, the federal and provincial governments had given an undertaking to harmonise federal and provincial taxes and that the provinces would enhance their cash surplus to Rs440bn next fiscal year from Rs210bn during current year to help contain overall fiscal deficit at 7.1pc of GDP next year.
In his meeting with KP Finance Minister Taimur Saleem Khan Jhagra, Mr Tarin asked the provincial administration “to adhere to strict financial discipline and work out modalities to rationalise expenditure and divert savings towards socioeconomic development in the province particularly amid Covid-19 and in post Covid-scenario”.
The KP minister was also asked to take measures that stimulate economic activity through out-of-box thinking for ‘enhancing revenues, rationalising workforce and harmonizing tax structure aiming at improving service delivery in the province’.
Mr Jhagra reported efforts being undertaken by the provincial government to curtail expenditure and rationalise spending with a key focus on providing maximum relief to the masses amid Covid-19 pandemic.
He also outlined measures taken to enhance provincial tax collection by expanding tax base and reducing the number of taxes. He expressed strong commitment of the KP government “to streamline pay and pension expenditure which takes the biggest chunk of the overall budget.
While discussing budget proposals, Mr Tarin stressed that education and health are the key priority areas and must be given preference during the budget-making exercise. He encouraged consultative process between the federal government and federating units for effective resource mobilisation.
Mr Tarin also advised the Punjab’s Finance Minister for value-addition in budget- making exercise and asked him to “rationalise expenditure and harmonise taxation policies for a growth-oriented budget”.
The Punjab finance minister briefed the economic team about the overall fiscal position and upcoming budget considerations and highlighted the steps taken by the provincial government to provide maximum relief to the vulnerable segments of the society during these testing times.",Newspaper

"Violence in Essa Nagri after ‘assault on minor girl’
","May 5, 2021","KARACHI: The PIB police on Tuesday arrested a young man for allegedly assaulting a minor girl in Essa Nagri.
The incident led to a violent reaction from the victim’s family and neighbours, who attacked the suspect’s house and blocked the main road for vehicular traffic, police and witnesses said.
They said that the 10-year-old girl after returning from tuition told her family that she was molested by a brother of her tutor at his home.
Enraged family members and neighbours took to the street and attacked the house of the suspect, who lived nearby.
“The suspect, however, managed to run away from the scene,” said an official at the PIB Colony police station. “This further enraged the girl’s family and the protesters, who turned violent. By the time a police team arrived there, the protesters had already blocked the service lane along the main road with burning tyres and junk.

The cases have also come down but mortalities remained the same for two weeks as Covid-19 killed elderly people and those with underlying conditions in the province. 
Dr Noor Islam, a former medical superintendent of tehsil headquarters hospital Takht Bhai in Mardan, died of coronavirus in Peshawar after remaining in isolation for one week, according a to a statement issued by Provincial Doctors Association. So far 65 doctors have died of the virus.
Except Swat and Charsadda, positivity of Covid-19 swabs has gone down during the past two weeks, according to a report. Abbottabad, which recorded one per cent infectivity of swabs two weeks earlier, remains the same.
On April 21, overall positivity rate was 7.1 per cent that rose to 7.4 per cent after two weeks. Mardan had 33 per cent positivity, Peshawar 26 per cent, Nowshera 20 per cent, Swabi 16 per cent, Charsadda nine per cent and Swat had two per cent, according to official document.

"Gates’ charitable foundation to remain intact after divorce
","May 5, 2021","SEATTLE: Billionaire benefactors Bill and Melinda Gates, co-founders of one of the world’s largest private charitable foundations, filed for divorce on Monday after 27 years of marriage. but pledged to continue their philanthropic work together (partly reported in Tuesday’s Dawn.
The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has become one of the most powerful and influential forces in global public health, spending more than $50 billion over the past two decades to bring a business approach to combating poverty and disease.
The Gates have backed widely praised programmes in malaria and polio eradication, child nutrition and vaccines. The foundation last year committed some $1.75 billion to Covid relief.
In a joint petition for dissolution of marriage, the couple asserted their legal union was “irretrievably broken”, but said they had reached agreement on how to divide their marital assets. No details of that accord were disclosed in the filing in King County Superior Court in Seattle.
Bill Gates, 65, who co-founded Microsoft Corp, and his spouse, Melinda French Gates, 56, met after she joined the software giant as a product manager, and they dated for a few years before marrying in Jan 1994 in Hawaii.
“After a great deal of thought and a lot of work on our relationship, we have made the decision to end our marriage,” the two said in a joint statement posted on each of their individual Twitter accounts.
“We no longer believe we can grow together as a couple in the next phase of our lives. We ask for space and privacy for our family as we begin to navigate this new life,” they said.
The divorce petition, which states that the couple have no minor children, comes after the youngest of their three offspring recently turned 18.
Launched in 2000, the non-profit Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation ranks as the largest private philanthropic foundation in the United States and one of the world’s biggest, with net assets of $43.3 billion at the end of 2019, according to the latest full-year financials shown on its website.
From 1994 through 2018, the couple gifted more than $36 billion to the Seattle-based foundation, the website said.
Last year, investor Warren Buffett reported donating more than $2 billion of stock from his Berkshire Hathaway Inc to the Gates Foundation as part of previously announced plans to give away his entire fortune before his death.
In their divorce petition, the couple asks the court “to dissolve our marriage” and to divide their communal property, business interests and liabilities “as set forth in our separation contract”, though that accord was not made public.
In a separate statement, the Gates Foundation said the couple would remain co-chairs and trustees of the organisation.
“They will continue to work together to shape and approve foundation strategies, advocate for the foundations issues, and set the organisation’s overall direction,” the statement said. The split comes two years after another leading Seattle-based billionaire and philanthropist, Amazon.com Inc founder Jeff Bezos, said that he and his then-wife, MacKenzie, were getting divorced.
At least one critic of billionaire benefactors cited the Gates’ split as a cautionary tale in the wisdom of concentrating so much sway over global humanitarian issues under the control of super-wealthy individuals.",Newspaper
"Top court orders Indian government to present oxygen plan
","May 5, 2021","India’s government, facing calls for a strict coronavirus lockdown to slow the devastating surge in infections, was ordered by the top court on Wednesday to submit a plan on meeting New Delhi hospitals’ oxygen requirements within a day.
The Supreme Court decided against immediately punishing officials for failing to end a two-week-old erratic supply of oxygen to overstretched hospitals.
“Ultimately putting officers in jail or hauling officers for contempt will not bring oxygen. Please tell us steps to solve this,” Justice Chandrachud said during the hearing.
It stayed the contempt notice issued to the government by a lower New Delhi High Court for defying its order on supplying adequate oxygen to more than 40 New Delhi hospitals. The government officials found guilty could have faced six months in prison or a fine.
With 382,315 new confirmed cases, India’s tally has risen to more than 20.6 million since the pandemic began. The Health Ministry on Wednesday also reported 3,780 deaths in the last 24 hours, bringing the total to 226,188. Experts believe both figures are an undercount.
On Tuesday, the New Delhi High Court court, which had summoned two Home Ministry officials for a hearing on Wednesday, 
 that the grim reality is that hospitals are reducing the number of beds and asking patients to move elsewhere. The court is hearing petitions filed by several hospitals and nursing homes struggling with irregular oxygen supplies.
“You can put your head in the sand like an ostrich, we will not. We are not going to take no for an answer,” Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said.
Raghav Chaddha, a spokesman for the Aam Aadmi Party governing New Delhi, said hospitals were getting only 40 per cent of their 700 metric tonnes requirements through the federal government, and the local government was arranging additional supplies to meet the shortfall and setting up new oxygen plants.
The latest wave of infections since April has pushed India’s health care to the brink with people begging for oxygen cylinders and hospital beds on social media and news channels.
 
Bodies have been piling up at cremation grounds and in graveyards with relatives waiting for hours for the last rites.
Dileep Kumar, a student, said he was asked by hospital authorities to shift his father to another hospital in Ghaziabad, a town on the outskirts of New Delhi, after it ran out of oxygen on Tuesday.
Authorities are scrambling to add more beds, sending oxygen from one corner of the country to another, and scaling up manufacturing of the few drugs effective against Covid-19.
Rahul Gandhi, a leader of the opposition Congress party, 
 “a lockdown is now the only option because of a complete lack of strategy by the Indian government.”
Modi’s government is reluctant to impose a national lockdown for fear of the economic fallout. Modi said last month that it should be the last resort.
But nearly a dozen states have imposed curbs on their own.
The most populous state of Uttar Pradesh, with 200m people, implemented a five-day lockdown this week. The country’s second and third most populated states of Maharashtra and Bihar are also under lockdown with varying curbs.
Efforts to scale up the vaccination drive are hampered by the shortage of doses. India, a country of 1.4 billion, has so far administered 160m doses.
The global community is extending a helping hand. The United States, Britain, Germany and several other nations are rushing therapeutics, rapid virus tests and oxygen to India, along with some materials needed for India to boost its domestic production of Covid-19 vaccines.",World

“Given the seriousness of the violations and the ongoing risk of violence, Facebook was justified in suspending Mr Trump's accounts on January 6 and extending that suspension on January 7,” the board said after its review.

"Variant causing India’s Covid explosion, says WHO
","May 10, 2021","GENEVA: A Covid-19 variant spreading in India is more contagious and it is feared it could be dodging some vaccine protections, contributing to the country’s explosive outbreak, the World Health Organisation’s chief scientist said.
In an interview, Soumya Swaminathan warned that  “the epidemiological features that we see in India today do indicate that it’s an extremely rapidly spreading variant”.
India on Saturday for the first time registered more than 4,000 Covid-19 deaths in just 24 hours, and more than 400,000 new infections.
New Delhi has struggled to contain the outbreak, which has overwhelmed its healthcare system, and many experts suspect the official death and case numbers are a gross underestimate.
Swaminathan, an Indian paediatrician and clinical scientist, said the B.1.617 variant of Covid-19, which was first detected in India last October, was clearly a contributing factor to the catastrophe unfolding in her homeland.
“There have been many accelerators that are fed into this,” the 62-year-old said, stressing that  “a more rapidly spreading virus is one of them”.
The WHO recently listed B.1.617 — which counts several sub-lineages with slightly different mutations and characteristics — as a  “variant of interest”.
But so far it has stopped short of adding it to its short list of  “variants of concern” — a label indicating it is more dangerous than the original version of the virus by being more transmissible, deadly or able to get past vaccine protections. Several national health authorities, including in the United States and Britain, have meanwhile said they consider B.1.617 a variant of concern, and Swaminathan said she expected the WHO to soon follow suit.
“B 1.617 is likely to be a variant of concern because it has some mutations which increase transmission, and which also potentially could make (it) resistant to antibodies that are generated by vaccination or by natural infection,” she said.
But she insisted that the variant alone could not be blamed for the dramatic surge in cases and deaths seen in India, pointing to  “huge social mixing and large gatherings” in recent months.
Mass election rallies held by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other politicians have for instance partly been blamed by some for the staggering rise in infections.
But even as many in India felt the crisis was over, dropping mask-wearing and other protection measures, the virus was quietly spreading.
“In a large country like India, you could have transmission at low levels, which is what happened for many months,” Swaminathan said.
“It was endemic (and) probably gradually increasing,” she said, decrying that  “those early signs were missed until it reached the point at which it was taking off vertically.”  “At that point it’s very hard to suppress, because it’s then involving tens of thousands of people and it’s multiplying at a rate at which it’s very difficult to stop.” While India is now trying to scale up vaccination to rein in the outbreak, Swaminathan warned that the jabs alone would not be enough to gain control of the situation.
She pointed out that India, the world’s largest vaccine-making nation, had only fully vaccinated around two percent of the 1.3 billion-plus population.",Newspaper
"‘RAW-trained MQM-London hitman’ arrested in Karachi
","May 10, 2021","KARACHI: Police on Sunday claimed to have arrested a suspect allegedly linked with the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-London, who got training from the Indian intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), and had killed 18 people, including policemen, over the years.
“The Malir City police arrested Mohammed Shahzad, alias Khajji, who is trained by RAW,” said a police spokesperson.
During the initial probe, he revealed that he had killed 18 people including policemen.
He joined the MQM in 1988 as a worker of its Shah Faisal Colony sector. He joined the team of hitmen led by Naeem Sharri in 1993.
The suspect along with his accomplices killed Sub-Inspector Mohammed Saleem and Constable Mohammed Ayub on Oct 17, 1994. DSP Mukhtar Ahmed Chaudhry was wounded in the same incident. The suspect also revealed the killing of policemen who were patrolling near Raza Square in Gulshan-i-Iqbal.
He along with his accomplices kidnapped six people in Moosa Colony and tortured them to death over suspicion of being informers.
After launching of Karachi Operation in 1996, the suspect went underground. Later on he was sent to South Africa by the organisation. 
The spokesman said on the directions of the MQM-L leadership he along with other colleagues was sent to Delhi where he was allegedly trained by RAW. After returning to Karachi, he remained involved in murders and attempted murders of political and religious persons.
The police claimed to have recovered a grenade from him and booked him in a case under relevant sections of anti-terror law.
The Gadap Town police on Sunday launched an investigation into the alleged rioting and kidnapping and injuring of villagers by security staff of Bahria Town Karachi (BTK) and detained over a dozen staff members of the property giant in late night raids, official sources said.
Two police officers confirmed on condition of anonymity that the police carried out raids in the BTK and took 13 suspects into custody for their alleged involvement in torturing of residents of Malir.
Among the detained persons were guards who allegedly resorted to firing and beating and injuring villagers on the outskirts of the metropolis near Kathor on Friday afternoon.
The police lodged an FIR (192/2021) under Sections 147, 148, 149, 337-A and 365 of the Pakistan Penal Code pertaining to rioting armed with weapons, kidnapping or abduction to murder and injuries, etc.
A police officer explained that the case was registered on the complaint of a resident of Kamal Khan Jokhio Goth, Jan Sher Khan.
The complainant in his statement before the police said that the BTK security staff started occupying land in the village after Friday prayers. As the residents put up resistance, the guards took him (the complainant) hostage, subjected him to torture and tied him with ropes attached to their vehicle and took him away.

"Traders warn of protest over shops’ forcible closure

“This is for Gen Qamar Javaid Bajwa (COAS). The army was called by the government under Article 245 to ensure implementation of the Covid-19 SOPs. But it was being used by the government to get the businesses of small shopkeepers forcibly closed which is a wrong act on the part of government,” All Pakistan Anjuman Tajran General Secretary Naeem Mir said in his video message.
He said the Pakistan Army was the most prestigious and disciplined institution that receives respect from the people in general and the traders in particular. Moreover, the people giving respect follow instructions of army and implement its orders whenever the government calls them for any issue under the Article 245 of the Constitution.  
“The traders especially the retailers/shopkeepers have expressed concerns over use of such a prestigious institution by the government for closing down their businesses on the pretext of Covid-19 SOPs and NCOC guidelines. If the army is used for ensuring wearing of masks by the people, controlling rush of people and getting the traders vaccinated, the traders would have appreciated it. But using army for closing down businesses is not good for its respect and prestige,” Mir deplored.
The APAT general secretary sarcastically congratulated the government for forcibly closing shops, businesses of small traders and shopkeepers and depriving them of their earning ahead of Eid for which they wait the whole year. “We congratulate the PTI government for snatching earnings of small traders, destructing their business, weakening them economically and suppressing them. You deserve medal for doing so,” he taunted.
He vowed to launch a movement against the government by keeping their shops open instead of observing shutter-down strike. The traders will have to change your strategy. You must prepare yourself for a major sit-in and encircling of the NCOC headquarters in Islamabad soon after Eid. “And we will not end our protest till resignation of NCOC chief Asad Umer,” he warned.",Pakistan

.
The report added that Azam had won the award for his ""consistent and outstanding performances across all formats in the recently concluded series against South Africa and was chosen as the April winner by fans and the ICC voting academy"". 
			 
Azam's match-winning 82-ball 94 in the third ODI against South Africa helped him gain 13 rating points to reach a career-best 865 points. He also contributed 122 from 59 balls in Pakistan’s successful chase in the third match of a T20I series against the same opposition.
“The world bats in two ways in white-ball cricket.
""One way is to destroy attacks with muscle and force and then there is the Babar Azam way, like conducting a batting symphony with punch, panache and flair, and he deserves to win this award,"" said Ramiz Raja — representing the ICC's voting academy — as he commented on Azam's performance in April.

"Millions at risk as cities fail to adapt to climate change, says report
","May 13, 2021","PARIS: Hundreds of cities have no climate adaptation plans in place despite rising threats like floods, heatwaves and pollution, according to a report on Wednesday that said this could put 400 million people at risk across the world. 
Fast-expanding urban areas are home to more than half the population of the planet and are increasingly exposed to climate-fuelled disasters, economic shocks and health crises as the world warms, with fears that vulnerable communities will be hardest hit. 
CDP, a global non-profit that collects data disclosed by companies, cities, states and regions on environmental impact, analysed over 800 cities and found that 43 per cent do not yet have a plan to adapt to the challenges of climate change. 
With more and more people drawn to live in urban areas, CDP estimated that by 2030 around 400m people would be living in poorly prepared cities.  
“The urgent need to act and have adaptation measures in place to keep the citizens safe, is increasing together with (the growing urban population),” said Mirjam Wolfrum, CDP’s policy director for Europe. 
She said that 93pc of the cities included in the report were facing “significant threats”, while 60pc highlighted “substantive” water security issues. 
The top five hazards are flash and surface flooding — including from rising sea levels — heat waves, rainstorms, extreme hot days and droughts, she said, adding that air pollution is also a major health concern. 
Ongoing adaptation strategies in the municipalities that reported to CDP include tree planting (20pc), flood mapping (18pc) and developing crisis management plans like evacuation systems (14pc). 
With cities responsible for some 70pc of global emissions, the report said urban centres are also looking at schemes like increasing the use of renewable energy and improving green spaces, transport infrastructure and recycling. 
Under the 2015 Paris climate deal, countries agreed to limit global heating to 2 degrees Celsius, with a less damaging target of 1.5 degrees Celsius. 
The years since have been among the hottest on record, while severe storms, floods and wildfires have affected communities across the planet. 
But in some cases cities are also moving faster and setting more ambitious climate targets than national governments, according to CDP. 
The report highlighted Santa Fe County in the United States, Greater Manchester in the United Kingdom and Penampang in Malaysia — the first city in Southeast Asia to report a net zero ambition. 
There has also been a marked increase in cities taking part in the CDP’s annual report, with 812 cities disclosing facts in 2020, compared to just 48 in the first study in 2011. 
Wolfrum said this could be down to the fact that the changes to the climate are increasingly visible.",Newspaper

“People will die in the same way in the third and fourth waves as they have this time” without more vaccines, Delhi’s Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia told reporters.
Deaths grew by a record 4,205 while infections rose 348,421 in the 24 hours to Wednesday, taking the tally past 23 million, health ministry data showed. Experts believe the actual numbers could be five to 10 times higher.
Funeral pyres have blazed in city parking lots, and bodies have washed up on the banks of the holy river Ganges, immersed by relatives whose villages were stripped bare of the wood needed for cremations.
Lacking beds, drugs and oxygen, many hospitals in the world’s second-most populous nation have been forced to turn away droves of sufferers.
“We seem to be plateauing around 400,000 cases a day,” the Indian Express newspaper quoted virologist Shahid Jameel as saying.  “It is still too early to say whether we have reached the peak.” 
India is using the AstraZeneca vaccine made at the Serum Institute in the western city of Pune and Covaxin by Bharat Biotech but has fully vaccinated barely 2.5pc of the population.
Indians need vaccines  “here and now”, the chief minister of West Bengal state, Mamata Banerjee, said in a letter to Modi.
The country accounts for half of Covid-19 cases and 30pc of deaths worldwide, the World Health Organisation said in its latest weekly report.
The full impact of the B.1.617 variant found in India, which the WHO has designated as being of global concern, is not yet clear, it added.
The variant has been detected in six countries in the Americas, the Pan American Health Organisation said, adding that it was worried that it was highly transmissible.
Britain, which has also detected the variant, is looking at all possible solutions to tackle a surge of related cases, including in the northern English town of Bolton, Prime Minister Boris Johnson told parliament.
Daily infections are shooting up in the Indian countryside in comparison to big towns, where they have slowed after last month’s surge, experts say.
More than half the cases this week in the western state of Maharashtra were in rural areas, up from a third a month ago. 
That share is nearly two-thirds in the most populous, and mainly rural, state of Uttar Pradesh, government data showed.
Television showed images of people weeping over the bodies of loved ones in ramshackle rural hospitals while others camped in wards tending to the sick.",Newspaper
"Notices issued to interior secretary, FIA DG in missing person case
","May 13, 2021","KARACHI: The Sindh High Court has issued show-cause notices to the federal secretary of ministry of interior and the director general of Federal Investigation Agency for flouting SHC directives in a petition of a missing person. 
The two-judge bench headed by Justice Mohammad Karim Khan Agha said that the secretary and the DG FIA were directed twice to collect and produce reports from the interment centres and submit travel history of the missing person, but they violated both orders and ordered them to appear on May 27. 
When the bench took up a petition, seeking whereabouts of a man who was reportedly taken away from his house in the Ancholi locality in February 2017, for hearing, the investigating officer of the case submitted a progress report. 
He submitted that a session of provincial taskforce on missing persons was held on April 22 which made some recommendations for the recovery of missing persons. 
The bench directed the IO to ensure that all such recommendations were carried out prior to the next date of hearing and also sought a detailed progress report. 
It noted that on Feb 25, the DG FIA was ordered to submit travel history of the missing person well before the next date and likewise the secretary of ministry of interior was also directed to collect the reports from interment centres and produce the same before the court without fail. 
However, the bench said neither order had been complied with by the DG FIA, nor by the interior secretary and on March 31 such directions were once again issued. 
But again the compliance has not been made which revealed that they have violated two orders of the bench and have no respect of these court orders, it added.
“Under these circumstances, we have no option but to issue show cause notice to both the DG FIA and secretary ministry of interior as to why they should not be proceeded with for contempt of this court orders”, the bench in its order said. 
It also directed them to appear before it on next hearing along with their replies to the show-cause notices and further asked the DG FIA to submit travel history of the missing person and the secretary of interior to provide details of all interment centres and persons detained therein. 
The petitioner approached the SHC in 2017 and contended that on Feb 10, 2017 some persons in plain clothes came to their house and forcibly took away her son Ali Raza Zaidi without disclosing any reason. 
She further maintained that they approached the area police station and other authorities concerned, but the whereabouts of her son remained unknown. 
It may be recalled that earlier the same bench had also issued a show-cause notice to secretary of ministry of interior in some other identical cases for repeatedly flouting its directives by not submitting details from the internment centres in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa regarding missing persons. 
The bench had also come down heavily on the federal authorities for taking little interest in identical cases and deplored that no legislation had so far been made against enforced disappearances. 
It had further remarked that the federal government had been raising hue and cry about tracing out the missing persons, but it appeared from the conduct of the secretaries of interior and defence that this was only for optics and no practical action was being taken.",Pakistan
"High levels of arsenic make underground water in Dadu lethal
","May 13, 2021","DADU: Underground water in Dadu city and surrounding areas has become brackish with high levels of salts and arsenic, making it completely unfit for human consumption and causing hepatitis A, B and C, renal, abdominal and skin diseases among people.
According to a survey, 90 per cent population in 24 wards of four union councils in the city were compelled to purchase freshwater from private reverse osmosis plants since the five RO plants installed by public health engineering department have not been functioning due to lack of repairs for the past five years. 
Geologist Adal Mahesar said that major cause of rise in hepatitis A, B and C, renal, abdominal and skin diseases in the city was the use of contaminated underground water, which had high levels of arsenic.
He said that clearance of forests had caused climate changes in the area and human waste of the city was being drained out into canals, which rendered freshwater bodies highly contaminated while majority of people were compelled to consume this poison.
Agricultural scientist Sabir Hussain Bhand said that municipal committee and public health engineering department had not cleaned ponds from where water was supplied to the city. 
These ponds were located at three different places and they had all become dirty, still they were supplying water to all parts of the city. When this water got mixed with drainage water it caused fatal diseases among citizens, he cautioned.
Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf district president Sardar Ashiq Ali Zour said that Dadu municipal committee had a monthly budget of Rs300 million but officers embezzled the huge amount every month and did nothing to resolve the issue of supply of clean water to citizens.
He said that Rs100m monthly budget of PHE for maintenance and operation of water supply schemes was also being embezzled every month while a water supply scheme worth Rs702m had not been completed over the past seven years.
Pakistan Peoples Party MPA Barrister Pir Mujeebul Haq said that he had repeatedly reminded the PHE and local government departments to make all water supply schemes and ROs functioning and complete remaining construction work on the schemes but in vain.
He said that he would approach chief minister and request him for allocating funds for water supply schemes and warned officers of PHE and municipal committee, saying he would take action against them and complain to the chief minister if all non-functioning ROs were not made functional.
DHO Dr Zahid Hussain Dawachh advised citizens to use clean and fresh water and advised them to drink filtered water to avoid waterborne diseases.
Former Sindh chief minister Liaquat Ali Jatoi said that Fareedabad, Shah Godrio, Mado, Gozo, Tharari Mohabbat, Nau Goth, Loong Mahesar, Kazi Arif, Mehar, Kakar, Khanpur, Chhinni, Wahi Pandhi, Tando Rahim Khan, Sawaro, Pat Gul Mohammad, Qasibo, Khudabad, Jhaloo and Moundar towns in Dadu district were also faced with similar problem. 
He said that an estimated 150 water supply schemes were lying non-functional in all parts of the district and 200 ROs were not working in the district. All the budget meant for maintenance and operation of ROs and water supply schemes had been embezzled by TMAs, MCs and PHE officials in the district, he said.
Dr Ghulam Abbas Mahesar said that 400 employees of PHE were comfortably drawing salaries while sitting at their home in the district. They were not performing their duties properly. People were purchasing freshwater from private ROs at a rate of Rs50 per jerry can, he said.",Pakistan
"Protective bail granted to housing society owners
","May 13, 2021","ISLAMABAD: Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday granted protective bail to the owners of a private housing society, Blue World in a land grabbing case till May 17.
The court directed the accused persons to surrender before the trial court and made it clear that the protective bail will lapse after the said date. IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah heard the case seeking protective bail for owners of the housing society Shoaibur Rehman, Naeem Ijaz and Waseem Ijaz.
Even though the court has been closed for Eid holidays, IHC devised a policy to hear cases related to imminent threat of life and liberty of a person and any other matter of urgent nature, henceforth the court was functioning with skeleton staff.
First information report (FIR) no 201, dated May 8, 2021 was registered against the accused for criminal trespassing, rioting with deadly weapons and criminal intimidation. The case was registered against them under sections 447, 506-ii, 511, 148 and 149 of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 at Police Station Chountra, Rawalpindi.
Counsel for the petitioners contended that the accused were involved in the aforementioned case with malafide intention and ulterior motives. The petitioners are residents of Islamabad Capital Territory and police officials are denying them an opportunity to surrender before the competent court, he maintained.
Justice Minallah noted that “without touching merits of the case and considering the intention to surrender before the court of competent jurisdiction, the petitioners are admitted to protective bail, subject to furnishing surety in the sum of Rs20,000”.
The petitioners will be at liberty to deposit the cash in the light of the policy of the court. They were directed to approach the court of competent jurisdiction on or before May 17, 2021 after which the court’s order will automatically lapse.
The petitioners have also been directed to surrender themselves before the investigation officer (IO) and forthwith join the investigation.",Pakistan
"UK economy in recovery mode before lockdown easing
","May 13, 2021","			
LONDON: Britain’s economy began to recover strongly at the end of the first quarter despite only minor easing of lockdowns, official data revealed on Wednesday.
Gross domestic product jumped 2.1 per cent in March, the Office for Nat­ional Statistics said, although by not enough for the UK economy to avoid contracting overall in the first quarter.
GDP shrank by 1.5pc in the first three months of 2021 compared with the final quarter last year, the ONS said.
The UK is exiting lockdowns at a gradual pace, allowing the economy to further recover from pandemic fallout.
“As we cautiously reopen the economy, I will continue to take all the steps necessary to support our recovery,” finance minister Rishi Sunak said in reaction to the data.
Darren Morgan, ONS director of economic statistics, said the strong recovery seen in March was led by retail and school reopenings, offsetting weakness in the services sector.
He added that construction grew strongly over the quarter and stood above its pre-pandemic level in March.
Morgan also noted that manufacturing recovered robustly in both February and March.
Meanwhile, “exports of goods to the EU continued to increase in March and are now almost back to their December level” before Brexit took place, he added.
“However, imports from Europe remain sluggish in the first three months of the year, being outstripped by non-EU imports for the first time on record.” Britain formally exited the European Union at the start of the year.
The growth recovery tallies with the Bank of England’s outlook.
The BoE last week said the UK economy will enjoy a stronger-than-expected re­­covery this year after the government began easing its coronavirus pandemic lockdowns quicker than anticipated.
It is expected to rebound by 7.25pc this year amid vaccine rollouts, the central bank predicted after it upgraded its prior guidance of a 5.0-percent expansion.
But it slashed its projection for 2022 to 5.75pc from 7.25pc as the government looks to claw back some of its vast pandemic-support outlay with higher taxation.
“Undoubtedly the true hit to the economy won’t be known until government interventions... end,” said Neil Wilson, analyst at Markets.com.
Analysts have also highlighted concerns that surging inflation, as economies reopen, could hamper growth recovery.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservative government has spent more than 350 billion pounds ($487bn) in emergency measures since the outbreak of Covid-19 at the start of 2020.",Newspaper

"SC likely to hear contempt plea against Punjab govt
","May 22, 2021","ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court is likely to take up on May 28 a contempt petition against the Punjab government for not implementing its March 25 order to restore the local government institutions in the province since their dissolution by the provincial government had been found to be unconstitutional.
The contempt petition will be taken up by a three-judge SC bench headed by Chief Justice Gulzar Ahmed. 
The bench may also take up a review petition filed by the Punjab government on Friday, seeking annulment of the March 25 order. 
Moved by 15 chairmen of different zila councils and mayors, the petition has made the Punjab chief secretary as well as the secretary of the Local Government and Community Development Department Lahore, Noorul Amin Mengal, respondents in the case. 
The petition pleaded that the respondent government under the Constitution was duty-bound to entrust the transition of powers smoothly and without any interruption to the petitioners and other members of the local governments. 
However, it said, the government was taking all it could to hamper the petitioners from taking charge of their offices and exercise powers conferred upon them under the law. 
The petition regretted that the petitioners were not being allowed to take control of their offices and being hampered to take charge of the work and most evidently the provincial government was still exercising control over the local governments through administrators appointed under a May 4, 2019 notification. 
Though the 2019 notification has lost its effect after the March 25 Supreme Court order, yet the Punjab government has let the notification to hold the field and has thus become guilty of committing contempt of the court under Article 204 of the Constitution, the petition argued.",Pakistan
"Suspension on Pakistan ratified by FIFA Congress
","May 22, 2021","KARACHI: The FIFA ban on Pakistan was ratified on Friday. What happens next remains to be seen.
The ratification of the suspension placed on Pakistan on April 7, following the takeover of the Pakistan Football Federation by a group of officials led by Ashfaq Hussain Shah from the FIFA-appointed Normalisation Committee, was on the agenda of the FIFA Congress which met virtually on Friday.
The vote for the ratification of the ban on Pakistan was put up in which 203 out of 209 FIFA member associations voted in favour, with one association voting against.
“Obviously, soon we hope we can lift the suspensions on the football associations,” said FIFA president Gianni Infantino, also referring to Chad whose ban was also ratified at the Congress.
On Wednesday the Ashfaq group, which came to power through an election held by the Supreme Court that wasn’t recognised by FIFA, held a news conference in which they gave detailed evidence of the flawed working of the Normalisation Committee since it was put in place in September 2019.
The PFF NC chairman Haroon Malik, who was appointed in January following the resignation of his predecessor Humza Khan in December last year, praised the Normalisation Committee for ensuring there were no further sanctions.
“Today at FIFA Congress Pakistan suspension was ratified, and due to the positive steps taken by the Normalisation Committee, any further sanctions were avoided,” Haroon wrote on Twitter. “The suspension can be lifted once Normalisation Committee chairman requests FIFA. This is the most positive outcome that was possible given the ongoing occupation by Ashfaq Shah group.”
Harron was asked to specify what further sanctions Pakistan was facing but did not respond.
The PFF NC has for long been claiming that Pakistan will be handed a long ban but when FIFA was handing out the ban, it clearly stated that the lifting of the ban rested upon the PFF headquarters being vacated by the Ashfaq group.",Newspaper
"Pharma firms, G20 pledge 3.6bn doses for poor nations
","May 22, 2021","ROME: Coronavirus vaccine producers promised billions of doses for poor countries at a G20 health summit on Friday, where leaders vowed to expand access to jabs as the only way to end the pandemic.
The bosses of Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson announced they would supply around 3.5 billion vaccine doses at cost or discount to low- and middle-income countries this year and next.
The European Union pledged to donate 100 million doses and invest in regional manufacturing hubs in Africa to reduce the continent’s reliance on imports.
The summit was billed as an attempt to learn lessons from the pandemic, which has killed more than 3.4m people globally since in emerged in late 2019.
But while many rich countries are enjoying a slowdown in infections thanks to vaccination drives, many others are still battling fresh surges.
“As we prepare for the next pandemic, our priority must be to ensure that we all overcome the current one together,” Draghi told the summit.
“We must vaccinate the world — and do it fast.” 
In Washington, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) report emphasised the same message, with a $50-billion  plan to end the pandemic focused heavily on expanding vaccines.
The summit will end with a “Rome declaration” on the guidelines to avoid another pandemic, from investment in global healthcare systems, improved data sharing and surveillance of human and animal diseases.
But it is not expected to endorse the contentious idea of a temporary global waiver on patent protections for coronavirus vaccines.
Instead, the leaders will advocate the use of other tools such as voluntary licensing agreements and technology transfers, EU officials said.
India and South Africa have for months led calls to temporarily remove the intellectual property protections on vaccines to boost production, a position recently backed by Washington but which has been met with scepticism in Brussels.
In a video message, Chinese President Xi Jinping reiterated Beijing’s support for a waiver and urged the World Trade Organization and other international institutions to make an “early decision”.
“China supports its vaccine companies in transferring technologies to other developing countries and carrying out joint production with them,” he added.
In an announcement at the summit, Pfizer promised two billion vaccine doses and Moderna “up to” 995m by the end of next year at cost or discount to poorer nations.
Johnson & Johnson unveiled a deal with the Covax vaccine-sharing programme for 200m doses this year, and said it was discussing the “potential supply” of an additional 300m for next year.
China promised $3bn in international aid over the next three years to support the fight against Covid-19 as well as economic recovery.

"India faces shortage of anti-fungal drug as rare disease adds to its woes
","May 22, 2021","BENGALURU: India said on Friday it was working to alleviate a shortage of a medicine used to treat a rare fungal disease hitting Covid patients as its healthcare system reels under a massive wave of coronavirus infections.
Cases of mucormycosis, or “black fungus”, a potentially serious condition that causes blurred or double vision, chest pain and breathing difficulties, have surged in India, mostly among coronavirus patients.
Over 7,250 such cases were found across the country till  May 19.
“In this battle of ours, another new challenge of black fungus has also emerged these days,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted on Friday.
India has the second-highest tally of confirmed Covid-19 cases in the world and has been reporting some 250,000 infections and 4,000 deaths daily.
With mucormycosis cases rising, the health ministry said it was looking for more companies to produce the antifungal drug amphotericin B and also increase imports of the medication.
That would lead to a nearly 250 percent increase in supply to around 570,000 vials next month, the ministry said on Friday.
Some Indian states like Maharashtra, home to the financial capital Mumbai, said they were running low on amphotericin B as black fungus cases spiked and had asked federal authorities to provide more.
“One patient needs 60 to 100 injections (of amphotericin B) depending on severity of illness. With current case load, we need more than 150,000 injections,” Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope told reporters.
The western state has reported 1,500 cases of mucormycosis so far, and 850 patients are undergoing treatment.
The state governments in the two southern states of Kerala and Karnataka have extended lockdowns to try to keep Covid-related infection from spreading further.
The lockdown in Kerala is likely to last until the end of this month, while it has been extended to June 7 in Karnataka.
After several other states, New Delhi has also decided to halt vaccinations for people in the age group of 18-44 years due to supply shortage.
Overall, India’s Covid-19 infection tally stands at more than 26 million, with a death toll of 291,331, according to health ministry data.
The country conducted roughly two million tests on Thursday, but experts have said infections and deaths could be between five-to-10 times higher than official estimates as the virus spreads to the vast hinterland.
India aims to double its testing capacity to 4.5 million per day by the end of next month, of which 60 percent would be through rapid antigen tests.
As part of the effort, the state-run Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) this week approved home testing for COVID-19, using rapid antigen tests.
These tests, less accurate than the RT-PCR method, are advised only for symptomatic cases and immediate contacts of laboratory-confirmed positive cases, according to the state-run ICMR.
“In rural areas or in field level areas, rapid antigen test is the backbone of testing and that should be encouraged,” Balram Bhargava, head of ICMR, told reporters.",Newspaper
"Parties express solidarity with people of Palestine, condemn Israeli aggression
","May 22, 2021","KARACHI: The city reverberated with anti-Israel slogans on Friday when almost all parties took to the streets and staged protests against the recent attacks by the Zionist state on Gaza, demanding an end to aggression against unarmed and innocent people of Palestine.
From right-wing religious organisations to ruling and opposition political parties and from civil society activists to labour rights campaigners, all put aside their differences to raise a collective voice against the Israeli aggression and regretted at the same time the response of the rulers of the Islamic countries, who failed to collectively stand for the people of Palestine.
Friday’s plan of various parties coincided with Prime Minister Imran Khan’s appeal to the nation to mark it as a day of solidarity with the oppressed Palestinians. 
 
The Jamaat-i-Islami held protest demonstrations in different parts of the city after Friday prayers.
The demonstrations, which were held outside mosques in various city areas, were attended by a large number of people. 
The JI would stage a Palestine March on Sunday (tomorrow) which would be addressed by party chief Senator Sirajul Haq.
Addressing the demonstrations, JI leaders slammed Israel’s atrocities and injustices and expressed their dismay over silence of the UN, the US and rulers of Pakistan and other Muslim countries.
They said that every Muslim must come out of his home to express solidarity with Pales­tinians, who were being killed and injured by the Israeli army.
A rally organised by the JI-Youth was also taken out from the Karachi Press Club to the US consulate general. Karachi JI chief Hafiz Naeemur Rahman led the rally.
However, as the participants of the rally were not allowed to march towards the US mission, they staged a sit-in at the Shaheen Complex traffic intersection causing a traffic mess on the busy I.I. Chundrigar Road and adjoining arteries. Later, they dispersed peacefully after Asr prayers.
The Majlis Wahdatul Muslimeen also staged demonstrations in the city on the same model as they protested outside Imambargahs in different areas after Friday prayers. 
Major demonstrations were held outside Jama Masjid Khoja Isna Ashari in Kharadar; Jama Masjid Noor-i-Iman in Nazim­abad; Jama Masjid Hussaini at Malir Baraf Khana; Jama Masjid Mustafa in Abbas Town; Jama Masjid Jafaria in North Karachi.
Speaking to protesters, religious scholars condemned the Israeli aggression and demanded the UN take action against the Zionist state.
They described the US and rights organisations like the UN as “puppets of Israel”, who were also allegedly involved in terrorism in Gaza.
They said that rulers of Pakistan and other Muslim states must play their role in saving innocent Palestinians from Israel. 
They said that all the Muslim countries must be united and take a strong and united stand against Israel immediately.
The ruling party at the centre, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, also staged a demonstration outside the Karachi Press Club on the appeal of Prime Minister Imran Khan. The party called for global unity against the Israeli aggression.
Speaking on the occasion, city president of PTI Khurram Sher Zaman said that it was not the issue of Muslims alone.
“What Israel is doing is a crime against humanity. Will the world show the same silence if the same attacks are carried out against any European country? Does the world have no respect for innocent people of Palestine,” he asked.
The Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) also organised a demonstration outside the KPC. It was addressed by party leaders Aslam Ghori, Abdul Razzaq Lakho and others.
Aurangzeb Farooqi of the banned Ahle Sunnat Wal Jamaat (ASWJ) vowed to take one million men to Palestine for “jihad” if the state allowed him to lodge a strong response against the Israeli aggression.
“Palestine is our Qibla-i-Awwal and we can go to any extent to keep its sovereignty and respect intact. The people and youth of Pakistan have faith in Allah and no power in the world can scare them,” he said.
He was addressing a rally near Nagan Chowrangi.
The banned Tehreek-i-Lab­baik Pakistan also took out a rally from Gurumandir to the KPC.
It was led by Hafiz Anas Hussain Rizvi and scores of people on cars, motorbikes, trucks and buses followed him to show solidarity with the Palestinian people.
The Pakistani Awami Tehreek also took out a rally from different parts of the city and converged at the KPC, where leaders addressed the participants.",Pakistan
"NAB launches probe into PU’s dubious housing scheme
","May 22, 2021","LAHORE: The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) has launched an investigation into alleged mismanagement and financial irregularities in the Punjab University Employees Cooperative Housing society (Town-III) project.
NAB Lahore started the probe on complaints that the PU housing project, launched over five years ago, had yet to see any development work and allotment of plots.
“A number of (PU) employees have been waiting to get their plots despite paying off major chunks of installments,” an official told 
 on Friday.
NAB has sought claims from the affectees.
“The affectees have been asked to contact the regional bureau of Lahore for submission of their claims against the PU cooperative society,” the official said.
According to the complaints filed with NAB so far, the PU had launched the said housing scheme when Dr Mujahid Kamran was the vice chancellor in 2016.
The varsity was to acquire 150 acres of land for the project. So far, it acquired 80 acres of land. According to the complaints, over 800 plots measuring 5 and 10 marlas and one kanal have been sold to the employees but no development work has been carried out as yet.
“One developer of the scheme has parted ways with the main company. The developer also registered an FIR against the other one, alleging that forgeries have been committed in the signed documents,” it alleged.
Earlier, a NAB reference against Dr Mujahid Kamran regarding illegal appointments in the PU had been filed in the accountability court Lahore in which charges framed against him.
 A duty judge of an accountability court on Friday issued a fresh direction to the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) to submit details of the assets owned by Leader of Opposition in National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif’s daughter Rabia and son-in-law Imran Ali Yousaf as they had been declared absconders in the Punjab Saaf Pani Company’s reference.
In the previous hearing, the investigating officer of NAB was directed to initiate proceedings under Section 88 of CrPC against the absconders and also submit details of their moveable and immoveable assets for the attachment accordingly.
However, NAB failed to submit the record on Friday and the duty judge adjourned the hearing till June 19 with a direction to the IO to submit the required record.
Former chairman Raja Qamarul Islam, also a former MPA of the PML-N, former chief executive officer of the company Waseem Ajmal and other suspects appeared before the court.
NAB alleged that Islam, being chairman of the company, was involved in awarding contracts of 84 water filtration plants at higher prices. It said the suspect had got the contracts of 102 plants approved from the company’s board of directors and committed forgery in documents.
The bureau accused Ajmal of violating procurement rules and permitting the installation of the water filtration plants in Dunyapur tehsil beyond the scope of the project.
Both Islam and Ajmal were arrested by NAB in June 2018 and were released on bail granted by the Lahore High Court on Jan 30, 2019.
Islam said NAB had arrested him a day after he was awarded ticket by the PML-N for 2018 general election against former interior minister Ch Nisar Ali Khan, the disgruntled leader of the party, from NA-59, Rawalpindi.",Pakistan

"Power restored in many areas of Karachi after major outage
","May 22, 2021","Several areas of Karachi faced power outage on Saturday afternoon after a high-tension transmission line of 220 kV tripped, affecting the supply of electricity to the associated grids, according to K-Electric – the utility company responsible for electricity supply in the city.
""Restoration efforts have already begun and are expected to be completed within one hour. Availability of generation supply is enabling restoration to progress swiftly,"" it tweeted. 
			
Initially, the company had said it had received reports of power breakdown in various areas of the metropolis and was ""urgently looking"" into them.
			
In a second 
, the power utility said its 220 kV high-tension circuit was affected by tripping in NTDC's NKI-Baldia 1 and 2 circuit supplying to Karachi.
""KE transmission system is intact and restoration is progressing swiftly,"" it said, adding that supply to all affected grids had been restored and downstream energising was underway.
			
""Power to all strategic sites has been restored in priority,"" the KE said.
It later tweeted that power supply had been restored to PECHS, DHA, Nipa, Clifton, Civil Lines, North Nazimabad, Gulistan-i-Jauhar, Gulshan-i-Iqbal, Federal B. Area, North Nazimabad, Bahadurabad, I.I. Chundrigar road, Gulshan-i-Maymar, Jail Chowrangi, Gadap, Orangi Town, Valika, Tower and Memon Goth.
KE said power restoration efforts were still underway in affected areas of North Karachi, Jacob Lines, Shah Faisal Colony, Malir and Baloch Colony. 
			
Meanwhile, the federal Ministry of Energy said that the supply of electricity to Karachi was affected because of tripping in Northern-Karachi Interconnections (NKI) transmission lines Baldia 1 and 2.
""The system in the rest of the country is completely normal. NTDC (National Transmission and Despatch Company) and KE officials are busy restoring electricity supply. The causes of tripping are also being investigated,"" it added.
			
Earlier, several residents, including politicians and journalists, shared messages on Twitter reporting outages in their areas.
			
			
MQM-P Senator Faisal Subzwari said ""half of Karachi"" was facing power breakdown and called on the federal government to step up and offer relief.
""There must be reasons but people suffering in this weather consider them excuses. Fed Govt must act to provide relief,"" he tweeted.
			
Some people questioned whether others were also facing the problem.
			
			
Others mentioned their areas and questioned K-Electric about the reason behind the outage.
			
			 
The last 
 took place less than five months ago, plunging the entire country into darkness. 
The blackout was reported a little before midnight of January 10 by citizens on social media from across the country, including major urban centres such as Karachi, Islamabad, Lahore and Multan, as well as smaller towns and cities.

"India tells social media firms to take down 'Indian variant' posts
","May 22, 2021","India's government has ordered social media platforms to take down content that refers to the “
” of the coronavirus.
The B.1.617 variant was first detected in India last year and has been blamed for much of a devastating Covid-19 wave that has battered South Asian nations in recent weeks.
It has 
 and at least 43 other countries, where “Indian variant” has become a widely used term.
The government order, sent on Friday by the electronics and information technology ministry, highlighted government sensitivity to accusations that it has mishandled the new surge.
In it, the ministry told social media companies to “remove all the content” that refers to the “Indian variant”.
“It has come to our knowledge that a false statement is being circulated online which implies that an 'Indian variant' of coronavirus is spreading across the countries. This is completely false,” read the letter, obtained by 
.
The ministry cited previous calls to curb “false news and misinformation” about the pandemic on social media as a basis for the order.
It argued that the World Health Organisation (WHO) did not link any country to the B.1.617 variant.
The WHO declared the strain a “
” last week as it spread around the world.
Several countries have banned or put severe restrictions on passengers from India since the variant emerged.
Many health experts and governments have used country names to describe new coronavirus variants that have emerged in Britain, Brazil and South Africa.
Indian government officials have regularly used the term “UK variant” since the mutant British strain started spreading in India.
The right-wing government has been criticised for its efforts to contain the new pandemic wave. India has faced severe shortages of oxygen, vaccines, hospital beds and life-saving drugs.
The government last month ordered Twitter and Facebook to 
 critical of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's handling of the crisis.
India on Saturday reported another 257,000 cases and 4,194 deaths in 24 hours, taking its total to 26.2 million infections and 295,525 deaths.
Almost half of the deaths have been recorded since late March when the new surge started battering the nation of 1.3 billion people.

"Regional exports post paltry growth of 1.8pc
","May 29, 2021","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s exports to nine regional countries posted a paltry growth of 1.818 per cent while imports from the region grew by nearly 31pc in first 10 months of the ongoing fiscal year (10MFY21) from a year ago, latest data released by the State Bank of Pakistan showed.
The country’s exports to Afgha­nistan, China, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, India, Iran, Nepal, Bhutan and the Maldives account for a small amount of $3.191 billion — just 15.26pc of Pakistan’s total global exports of $20.906bn in 10MFY21.
China tops the list of countries in terms of Pakistan’s exports to its neighbours, leaving other populous countries India and Bangladesh behind. Pakistan carried out its border trade with the farther neighbour Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Bangla­desh and Maldives via sea only.
On the other hand, imports from these countries edged up to $10.754bn in 10MFY21 against $7.638bn over the corresponding period last year, showing an increase of 30.97pc. As a result of huge imports, Pakistan’s trade deficit with the region expanded during the period under review.
Pakistan’s exports to China posted positive growth during July-April 2020-21. Bulk of the regional exports share, which accounts for 51.4pc, is with China while the remaining is for eight countries.
Pakistan’s exports to China posted a growth of 16.22pc to $1.640bn in 10MFY21 from $1.411bn in 10MFY20. The increase in export proceeds was noted in the post-Covid period. However, it is not clear now whether the gain is one time or it is the outcome of the Ministry of Commerce claims to have brokered preferential market access for local products under the second phase of the free trade agreement with Beijing.
Contrary to this, imports from China grew 35pc to $10.312bn during the period under review against $8.211bn over the last year. The bulk of 95.88pc imports is coming from China alone while remaining imports are from other eight countries.
Pakistan’s exports to Afghanistan posted a growth of 2.35pc to $828.727m in 10MFY21 from $809.685m in the same period in FY20. Till a few years ago, Afghanistan was the second major export destination for Pakistan after the United States.
Imports from Afghanistan posted a growth of 27.34pc to $147.403m against $115.747m over the last year. Imports from Afghanistan have seen visible improvement, especially of essential kitchen items inclu­ding tomatoes, potatoes and onions as well as fresh and dried fruits.
The country’s exports to India plunged 90.9pc to $2.252m this year from $24.992m in 10MFY20. The imports from India dipped 56.5pc to $153.601m against $353.162m over the last year. The government has suspended trade relations with New Delhi. Since the arrival of Covid-19 pandemic, the government has only allowed import of pharmaceutical products from India.
Pakistan’s exports to Iran jumped 374.5pc to $0.261m in 10MFY21 from $0.055m in 10MFY20. Most of the trade with Tehran is carried out through informal channels in border areas of Balochistan. No imports were made from Tehran during the period under review.
Exports to Bangladesh decreased 17pc to $497.396m in 10MFY21 from $599.658m. Imports from Dhaka posted a growth of 64.9pc to $68.362m this year against $41.450m over the last year.
Similarly, exports to Sri Lanka dipped by 18.5pc to $213.794m in 10MFY21 from $262.482m in the previous year. Islamabad has signed the first-ever FTA with Colombo but trade between the two countries remains far behind its true potential. Imports from Sri Lanka posted a growth of 14.6pc to $72.081m this year against $62.902m over the last year.
In the last visit of Prime Minister Imran Khan to Sri Lanka, both countries agreed to exploit the available potential of bilateral trade.
On the other hand, Pakistan’s exports to Nepal plunged by 80.4pc to $3.987m in 10MFY21 from $20.374m the previous year. However, imports posted a growth of 140.87pc to $0.937m this year against $0.389m over the last year.

"City, Chelsea eye CL glory in ‘all-English’ final
","May 29, 2021","PORTO: Looming over Liberdade Square, the giant European Cup replica that supporters of Chelsea and Manchester City crane their necks to photograph is a reminder of the prize being sought in Saturday’s Champions League final.
And the footballing heritage their clubs tried to wreck only a month ago.
The all-English final in Porto is a meeting of two of Europe’s richest teams at the end of a pandemic-compressed season that has stretched squads to the limit and benefited those with the deepest resources.
It’s another reminder of the advantages held by the elite who seem forever to be seeking great wealth and power, undercutting any broadening of the profile of would-be finalists.
But for all the rancour and recriminations in the fallout from the collapse of the Super League breakaway, the 66th final of UEFA’s elite competition does provide glimmers of optimism and hope in challenging times both within the sport and beyond.
The journey to the final has been one not witnessed by any City or Chelsea fans in the flesh in any stadium, home or away. They even missed the chance to protest in stadiums against the bid by their own clubs to launch the largely closed replacement for the Champions League that collapsed within 48 hours.
Finally, in their 13th game of the competition, fans will be allowed into the Estadio do Dragao. The roar and energy of the crowd, so missing throughout the pandemic, will be back for the UEFA showpiece after last season’s final was played in an empty Lisbon stadium.
The Champions League final returns to Portugal more out of necessity after Istanbul was abandoned due to Turkey’s rise in coronavirus infections.
Hopes of an easier journey for the fans playing the final on home soil at Wembley were thwarted by coronavirus controls preventing unrestricted access for the UEFA delegations. That led to Portugal opening its borders to more than 10,000 visiting fans.
It’s the type of mass movement of football supporters across Europe not seen in the Champions League since the start of the pandemic last March. 
There are often pitfalls to groups of English fans traveling. There was a brief flare-up of unrest on the streets of Porto on Thursday night as all restaurants and bars were closed by 10:30 p.m. due to the pandemic curfew.
Getting to Portugal and into the stadium required multiple coronavirus tests, costing hundreds of dollars.
But that’s been the least complicated aspect of Manchester City making it to the European Cup final for the first time in their 141-year history, thanks to the club being elevated to join Europe’s elite following its Abu Dhabi takeover 13 years ago. The influx of cash from Sheikh Mansour a member of Abu Dhabi’s ruling family delivered unprecedented success for a team that long lived in the shadow of three-time European champion Manchester United.
But the lavish assembling of the team also attracted investigations for breaching Financial Fair Play rules and punishments for obstructing the investigators. Those FFP rules are now being overhauled to allow the type of heavier spending on players impeded by the current regulations. A year ago Pep Guardiola’s side faced being excluded from the Champions League until the club’s squad of lawyers helped to secure a decisive victory to overturn the UEFA ban at the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
Guardiola is in his first Champions League final since winning for a second time as Barcelona coach in 2011, reaching this stage with City at his fifth attempt.
It’s more familiar territory for Thomas Tuchel, a losing finalist last season when Paris St Germain fell to Bayern Munich. The German will be leading out Chelsea in Porto only 123 days after being hired by Chelsea to save a season faltering under Frank Lampard. A top-four place in the Premier League was recovered to qualify for the Champions League without even having to win the final.
It is reminiscent of 2012 when another midseason appointee Roberto Di Matteo took Chelsea to their first Champions League final and beat Bayern Munich on its own turf. It was no underdog success, instead the fulfillment of Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich’s target after buying the club in 2003.
Chelsea have beaten City twice in this season’s three encounters, including in the FA Cup semi-finals but Tuchel’s side went on to lose to Leicester City. City, though, already have two trophies after winning the League Cup for a fourth consecutive season and the Premier League for the fifth time in 10 seasons.
“It’s always so, so tough to play against his teams,” Tuchel said of Guardiola. “I watched his Barcelona team to learn from him and his team about football: how you can defend, how you can attack.” 
The admiration is mutual. 
“I learn a lot from Thomas,” Guardiola said. “I learned a lot watching his teams, with our conversations. It doesn’t matter if he has a lot of info about us or about me because, in the end, luckily for world football, he cannot play, I cannot play. So, in the end, the guys who are going to decide the final will be the players.”
City’s success, in winning three of the last four Premier League titles, owes much to Guardiola’s brilliance as a coach and tactician and the club’s excellent record in recruitment. 
Under the Spaniard, City have produced some magnificent passing football but this year, largely thanks to the signing of Portuguese defender Ruben Dias, they have added steel at the back to the flair in the final third. 
In previous European campaigns, City have exited after poor defensive displays where they fell apart at the back in crucial periods. 
Chelsea, with Brazilian veteran Thiago Silva at the heart of their defence, have also tightened up at the back and indeed the two finalists have conceded just four goals each in Europe this season. 
Chelsea have been transformed since Tuchel replaced Lampard in January, even if they did finish the domestic season with three defeats in four games. 
“We have arrived here. This is an incredible achievement and once you arrive you want to be on your very best, but it’s City with Pep on the other side who are maybe at the moment the best in Europe, maybe in the world,” said Tuchel, who was given a boost as fitness concerns Edouard Mendy and N’Golo Kante returned to training on Wednesday. 
“It is on us again to close the gap for 90 minutes and the good thing is we did it already. In football everything is possible and in a final everything is possible.”",Newspaper
"Probe clears Johnson over ‘wallpapergate’ scandal
","May 29, 2021","LONDON: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson acted “unwisely” over funding arrangements for a lavish makeover of his Downing Street flat, but was not guilty of any impropriety, his ethics adviser concluded on Friday. 
The finding by Christopher Geidt, the UK government’s newly appointed adviser on ministerial standards, does not entirely lift the cloud over the “wallpapergate” affair with several other probes still under way. 
It is also likely to fuel questions about why civil servants, at Johnson’s direction, were busy working on creating a White House-style trust to manage the Downing Street complex in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic last year. 
Publishing an annual report on ministerial interests, Geidt found that Johnson “knew nothing” about how the designer makeover of his private quarters was funded, noting the works had begun as he was critically ill with Covid-19 in early April 2020. 
The prime minister should have shown more curiosity later but believed that the putative charitable trust would take care of the invoices, Geidt said. 
Officials failed to brief Johnson that the proposed trust was proving hard to get off the ground, he said, and the invoices were in fact settled by the Conservative Party and a wealthy party donor. 
“Given the level of the prime minister’s expectations for the trust to deliver on the objects he had set, this was a significant failing,” the adviser’s report said. 
“Instead, the prime minister — unwisely, in my view — allowed the refurbishment of the apartment at No 11 Downing Street to proceed without more rigorous regard for how this would be funded.” 
Johnson only became aware of the issue in February this year, Geidt said, after press reports raised questions about funding for the redecoration — which reportedly stretched to $284,000, far above an annual government allowance. 
He settled the bill himself in March, and Geidt said he was “content that no conflict — or reasonably perceived conflict — arises as a result of these interests”. 
A Downing Street spokesperson said the adviser’s report showed Johnson had adhered to the UK ministerial code “at all times” and stressed that no taxpayer money was used in the redecoration, above the allowance of 30,000 pounds. 
Breaches of the code are normally considered a matter for resignation — Geidt’s predecessor quit when Johnson refused to fire Home Secretary Priti Patel over a finding that she had bullied her officials. 
Geidt meanwhile was grilled by opposition MPs two weeks ago on whether he is truly independent of Johnson.
The adviser is firmly an establishment figure: a former army officer and diplomat, he was private secretary to Queen Elizabeth II for 10 years to 2017, and sits in the House of Lords. 
Several parliamentary probes remain under way over the flat revamp. Most seriously for Johnson, Britain’s Electoral Commission last month launched its own investigation. 
The commission, which regulates political finance and can refer investigations to the police, said it had found “reasonable grounds to suspect that an offence or offences may have occurred”.",Newspaper
"Germany admits to Namibia genocide, but critics want more
","May 29, 2021","BERLIN: Germany on Friday recognised it had committed genocide in colonial-era Namibia and promised a billion euros in financial support to descendants of the victims, in a move welcomed as a “first step” by Namibia but slammed as insufficient by activists. 
“We will now officially refer to these events as what they are from today’s perspective: genocide,” said Foreign Minister Heiko Maas. 
“In light of the historical and moral responsibility of Germany, we will ask forgiveness from Namibia and the victims’ descendants” for the atrocities committed, he added. 
The agreement came after more than five years of negotiations between the two countries over events in the territory held by Berlin from 1884 to 1915. 
German colonial settlers killed tens of thousands of indigenous Herero and Nama people in 1904-1908 massacres — labelled the first genocide of the 20th century by historians and poisoning relations between Namibia and Germany for years. 
In a “gesture to recognise the immense suffering inflicted on the victims”, Germany will support the “reconstruction and the development” of Namibia via a financial programme of 1.1 billion euros ($1.34 billion), Maas said. 
The sum will be paid over 30 years, according to sources close to the negotiations, and must primarily benefit the descendants of the Herero and Nama. 
Yet Maas stopped short of referring to reparations, saying the payment did not open the way to any “legal request for compensation”. 
“The acceptance on the part of Germany that a genocide was committed is the first step in the right direction,” Namibian President Hage Geingob’s spokesman Alfredo Hengari said. 
“It is the basis for the second step, which is an apology, to be followed by reparations,” he added. 
Activist groups in both countries also criticised the lack of direct reparations, with the German-based initiative “Berlin Postkolonial” saying it was “doomed to fail” and “not worth the paper it is written on”. 
The group, which is set to hold a protest in the German capital, said the Herero and Nama communities had not been consulted sufficiently in the negotiations. 
In Namibia, a Herero leader accused the government of being strong-armed into the accord. 
“We will not accept any outcome between these two governments,” Mutjinde Katjiua, secretary general of the Ovaherero Traditional Authority, said. 
Namibia was called German South West Africa during Berlin’s 1884-1915 rule, and then fell under South African sway for 75 years, before finally gaining independence in 1990. 
Tensions boiled over in 1904 when the Herero — deprived of their livestock and land — rose up, followed shortly after by the Nama, in an insurrection crushed by German imperial troops. 
In the Battle of Waterberg in August 1904, around 80,000 Herero, including women and children, fled and were pursued by German troops across what is now known as the Kalahari Desert. Only 15,000 survived. 
German General Lothar von Trotha, sent to put down the rebellion, ordered the peoples’ extermination. 
At least 60,000 Herero and around 10,000 Nama were killed between 1904 and 1908. Colonial soldiers carried out mass executions and forced men, women and children to flee to the desert where thousands died of thirst. 
They also established infamous concentration camps, such as the one on Shark Island. 
Negotiations over an apology began in 2015, and in 2018 Germany returned the bones of members of the Herero and Nama tribes, with the minister for international cultural policy Michelle Muentefering asking for “forgiveness from the bottom of my heart”.",Newspaper
"Sindh to seek parliament’s joint session against ‘controversial’ census
","May 29, 2021","KARACHI: The Sindh government on Friday announced that it would challenge the ‘controversial’ National Census-2017 despite its approval by the Council of Common Interests and decided to seek a joint session of parliament to debate the “undercounted” population of Sindh and Balochistan. 
The decision came from the top leadership of the party and the chief executive of the province as they agreed that despite the federal government’s commitment for holding a fresh census by the end of 2021, it was crucial to discuss the subject in parliament in line with the requirements of the Constitution.  
An hour-long meeting between Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah and Pakistan Peoples Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari was held to discuss the issue. Law Adviser Barrister Murtaza Wahab was also present in the meeting. 
The meeting also finalised the draft to be presented before the Senate chairman and National Assembly speaker seeking a joint session of parliament to discuss the sixth National Census-2017. 
“The meeting regretted that despite the serious objection raised by the Sindh chief minister during the meeting of Council of Common Interests (CCI), the 6th National Census-2017 was approved,” said a statement issued after the meeting at Bilawal House. “The federal government approved the 6th National Census-2017 without meeting formalities. It’s unjust and illegal.” 
The Sindh chief minister, it said, had very clearly raised objection over the headcount in Sindh and Balochistan but despite his reservations it was approved against the norms, tradition and rules of the CCI.  
 
The PPP would go for a joint session of parliament to open debate on the sixth National Census-2017 under Article 154 of the Constitution. 
Defining the party stance, Barrister Wahab said that the PPP had made it very clear that it would not accept the National Census-2017 and any future decision under the cover of this exercise.  
The joint session of parliament, he said, was mandatory to meet the constitutional requirement to debate the “controversial” results of the census. 
“At the April 2021 meeting of the CCI, the Sindh chief minister was the only person who raised objection and opposed the approval of the census,” he told Dawn. “But his reservations were ignored and the census was approved with the majority votes after Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan approved the results. But let everyone be clear — the CCI never approves or rejects things on the basis of majority. The CCI always takes consensus decisions. So in this case, the Constitution demands parliament discuss issues the centre and the province [do not] agree [on].” 
He said the Sindh government was writing to the Senate chairman and NA speaker for convening parliament’s joint session. The copy of this would also be sent to the president and prime minister as a legal requirement while referring to clause 7 of Article 154 which clearly asked for parliamentary debate on the subject.",Pakistan
"KP govt overstepped authority on cabinet size, AG acknowledges
","May 29, 2021","PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa advocate general Shumail Ahmad Butt on Friday acknowledged that the provincial government had exceeded its constitutional authority by inducting more ministers than the permissible number.
Mr Butt conveyed his legal opinion on the size of the cabinet to Speaker of the provincial assembly Mushtaq Ahmad Ghani over the phone for being out of town.
Through a ruling given during a session, the speaker directed him to appear in the house on Monday for a detailed opinion on the matter.
The government found itself in hot water when opposition Pakistan Peoples Party MPA Ahmad Kundi said on a point of order that the cabinet’s strength reached 17 after the induction of four new ministers, who took their oath on April 13.
The government had notified Atif Khan, Fazal Shakoor Khan, Shakeel Ahmed Khan and Faisal Amin Gandapur as members of the cabinet.
Later, portfolios of Atif Khan, Fazal Shakoor Khan and Shakeel Ahmed Khan were notified. However, Faisal Amin Gandapur, younger brother of federal minister Ali Amin Gandapur, has yet to be assigned a portfolio.
Besides ministers, the government also appointed one adviser and nine special assistants to the chief minister and three parliamentary secretaries.
The lawmaker said the government had blatantly violated Article 130(6) of the Constitution, which declared that the total strength of the cabinet should be 15 or 11 per cent of the total membership of the assembly, which currently stood at 145.
He, however, said the provincial cabinet’s current strength, including the chief minister, was 17 in violation of the Constitution.
The opposition member requested the chair to give a ruling on the matter.
He said the Constitution had been violated, so the business of the assembly and the orders and decisions of the government were illegal and unconstitutional.
Speaker Mushtaq Ghani, who presided over the sitting, said Mr Kundi had raised a very valid point and therefore, minister for law and parliamentary affairs Fazal Shakoor Khan should respond to it.
The law minister informed the house that the cabinet’s strength was 16 as one minister was without portfolio. However, the chair didn’t agree to the argument.
Speaker Mushtaq Ghani later gave the floor to labour minister Shaukat Ali Yousafzai, who said the advocate general had been consulted on the issue, while the government had also referred the matter to the law minister.
He assured the chair that the government would submit a reply to it to the assembly on Monday.
Speaker Ghani issued orders for calling advocate general Shumail Ahmad Butt to the house at once for giving opinion on the issue.
When the chair was informed that the advocate general was not present in Peshawar, he directed the relevant officials to learn about his opinion over the telephone.
After a short while, the speaker said he received a note from the AG declaring that the stand of MPA Kundi was right in the ‘present context’.
He said the AG would come to the assembly on Monday to give a detailed opinion on the composition of the cabinet.
The speaker said any constitutional act of the government didn’t affect the assembly business.
He issued another ruling asking Chief Minister Mahmood Khan to request to the chief justice of Peshawar High Court to constitute a judicial commission headed by a high court judge to hold an impartial inquiry into the illegal plot allotments and encroachment in Bannu city and adjacent areas.
The ruling came after the lawmakers from southern districts completed discussion on an adjournment motion of Opposition Leader Akram Khan Durrani about the demolition of a huge structure at an intersection in the middle of Bannu city and the scrap auction without tender.
He alleged that the deputy commissioner of Bannu and commissioner of Bannu Division, who enjoyed the backing of a senior bureaucrat, were involved in illegal practices.
The opposition leader insisted that those bureaucrats considered themselves to be above the law.
Without directly blaming Akram Durrani, members of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf said some influential people were trying to stop the administration from taking action against encroachers in the city.
They said the commercial property occupied by influential people in different localities of the town and along the main irrigation canal valued around Rs11 billion.
Later, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Probation and Parole Bill, 2021, was introduced in the house with the objective to regulate the probation of convicts, their rehabilitation and reintegration and matters relating to parole in the province.
The bill is meant to repeal the existing laws on the subject, including Probation of Offenders Ordinance, 1960, and Good Conduct Prisoners Release Act, 1926, to the extent of KP.
The chair adjourned the session until 2pm on Monday.",Pakistan
"Covid vaccine made compulsory for educational staff: NCOC
","May 29, 2021","Covid-19 vaccinations have been made mandatory for educational staff in order to ensure the safe continuation of the education sector, according to a press release issued by the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) on Saturday.
The decision was taken in a meeting of the NCOC chaired by Federal Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Asad Umar and National Coordinator Lt Gen Hamood Uz Zaman Khan with Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Health Dr Faisal Sultan also in attendance via video link.
The forum directed that inoculations for educational staff be completed by June 10, adding that walk-in vaccination had already been opened across the country for all teachers and school staff above 18. 
The decision on mandatory inoculations was taken as the NCOC also set dates for examinations of grades 10 and 12 to be held from June 23 to July 29. The forum decided that provinces would be allowed to open staggered classes for grades 10 and 12 from May 31 for exam preparations, subject to compliance with stringent Covid-19 standard operating procedures (SOPs). 
Last week, the NCOC had allowed the 
 from June 7 in districts where the positivity rate was less than five per cent, adding that matric and intermediate exams would be held after June 20.
Among other decisions taken in the meeting today, travellers from the United Arab Emirates would be required to furnish PCR tests from authorised laboratories and airlines would be fined in case of any violations or accepting PCR results from unauthorised laboratories. Passengers would be retested upon arrival and subjected to a strict mechanism of quarantine if found positive for Covid-19. 
The NCOC also decided that from June 1, tourists above 50 years of age would not be allowed to stay in hotels in districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhawa, Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir without  a vaccination certificate. 
The same restriction would apply to tourists above 30 from July 1, said the press release. 
Additionally, amusement parks, water parks and swimming pools would also be allowed to reopen with 50pc occupancy and strict SOPs in districts with a positivity rate at or below 5pc.

"PM assures MQM of support to solve Sindh problems
","June 5, 2021","ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Friday assured the Muttahida Qaumi Movement of Centre’s support to address problems confronting Sindh, particularly Karachi, after an MQM delegation presented five demands to him to address key issues of the province.  
The demands presented by the MQM delegation comprising Minister for Information Technology Amin-ul-Haq, Senator Faisal Sabzwari, Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, Javed Hanif, Amir Khan, Waseem Akhtar and Kunwar Naveed Jameel were: allocation of funds for new census in coming federal budget, funds for uplift work under Karachi Development Package, an inquiry into “issuance of fake domiciles” of Karachi, Hyderabad and Mirpurkhas, early functioning of Hyderabad University and eradication of bandits’ sway and corruption in Sindh.  
Talking to 
, IT Minister Haq said the MQM delegation asked the prime minister to ensure implementation of his own decision regarding holding of fresh census that should be completed before next general elections in 2023. “We asked the prime minister to ensure that required funds are allocated for this purpose in coming budget,” he added.  
He said the delegation also demanded allocation of a “big amount of funds” for development activities in Sindh, particularly Karachi. “The delegation told the prime minister that unlike the three other provinces, the PTI allies are facing an anti-Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government in Sindh where the provincial government does not pay heed to basic civic problems of Karachi and other areas dominated by the MQM and the PTI,” he said.  
Mr Haq said the issuance of fake domiciles of Karachi, Hyderabad and Mirpurkhas also came under discussion and the MQM demanded a high-level inquiry into the scam.  
The delegation, he said, also demanded early functioning of newly established Hyderabad University. He said a bill regarding establishment and functioning of the varsity would be tabled in the National Assembly on June 7.  
Regarding what he called “dacoits’ Raj” in Sindh, Mr Haq said the prime minister was apprised that some members of the provincial assembly and local politicians were backing bandits and were involved in mega corruption that had paved the way to joblessness, poverty, injustice and pathetic conditions in the urban areas etc.  
The IT minister said the meeting was held in a cordial atmosphere and the prime minister assured the MQM delegation that its demands would be met.  
Prime Minister Khan said the federal government was aware of development needs of the people of Sindh and the problems faced by them, Mr Haq said. “The federal government is playing its role in addressing the problems faced by the people of Sindh and would continue to do so in future as well,” he added.  
Sindh Governor Imran Ismail was present at the meeting during which the problems of Sindh, particularly Karachi, its development needs, development projects under next budget and matters relating to the PTI-MQM alliance were discussed.  
Besides presenting proposals for the next budget, the delegation expressed the MQM’s support to the budget.  
The prime minister assured the delegation that the development needs of Karachi and Hyderabad would be considered during the preparation of next budget. “Since the progress of Karachi — the economic hub of the country — is the progress of Pakistan, its development and solution of its problems will be ensured,” he added.  
Addressing the groundbreaking ceremony of Lodhran-Multan road, the prime minister said the country’s economic turnaround had brought down the curtain on “bad days” and heralded an era of economic growth, wealth creation and jobs for youth.  
“I believe bad days have passed. Insha Allah (God willing), in the coming days, Pakistan’s economic growth will not be turbulent, with up and down cycles. Pakistan will start its journey from when it was the fourth largest economy in Asia in 1968 after Japan, China and India,” he said.  
The 62-kilometre north-bound section of N-5 will connect the districts of Multan, Lodhran and Bahawalpur. The project will be completed in two years at a cost of about Rs6.8 billion.  
Mr Khan claimed that the incumbent government had constructed three times more roads as compared to the previous government, which was known only for building roads. The prime minister said the government faced criticism from the opposition which wanted to topple the government unless their leaders were given NRO.  
“My own people had to face tough time. The media also gave an impression that Naya Pakistan can emerge by switching on a button,” he said.  
The prime minister said it always took time to change the status quo as the mafias resisted any such movement to protect their interests. Similarly, the opposition yearned for the government’s failure to protect their laundered money and properties abroad, he said.  
Contrary to India, Mr Khan said, Pakistan was sailing through the Covid-19 situation owing to the government’s prudent policies although the two countries had identical population density and weather conditions.  He said the IT sector was under the government’s focus to exploit its immense potential as India was earning around $80 billion from IT exports.  
Mr Khan said the construction of 10 dams was in progress to produce clean energy and utilise the 50,000MW potential of hydropower. For the first time, tree plantation on a massive scale was being done under the Ten Billion Tree Tsunami and new national parks were being developed, he added.  
In his address, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said the Lodhran-Multan road would benefit three districts and connect two divisions of Multan and Bahawalpur.  
He said the South Punjab Secretariat was an extraordinary step that would go a long way in strengthening the federation by addressing the political imbalance.  
Communications Minister Murad Saeed said work on the Sukkur-Hyderabad motorway would start in three months.  
He said during two and half years of PTI government, the National Highway Authority had increased its revenue by 105 per cent.  He said work on the Sialkot-Kharian motorway would start within 10 days and on the Kharian-Rawalpindi section within three months.  
Later the prime minister met a number of PTI legislators from national and provincial assemblies.",Pakistan
"Punjab nominates team for monitoring barrages
","June 5, 2021","LAHORE: Following the decision taken by Prime Minister Imran Khan for tripartite checking of river water situation, Punjab on Friday nominated nine officers to accompany the Wapda teams to gauge water inflows and outflows at all the critical barrages in the country. 
Under the arrangement finalised by the PM Office after a meeting on May 27 in which provincial and federal representatives had explained their points of view, a three-tier formula was agreed upon, involving representatives of the Water and Power Development Authority, Sindh and the Punjab. 
Following instructions from the PM Office, the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) had written to Punjab on May 31, asking it to nominate its members for the purpose. Punjab has obliged. 
Professionals from Wapda have been inducted as independent federal representatives, who along with nominees of Sindh and Punjab will visit the barrages to assess discharges and gauging mechanisms installed there. 
Nominating its representatives, Punjab again insisted on Friday that monitoring teams need to reach there (barrages) as early as possible and make sure the discharge gauges worked not only properly but permanently to address the alleged misreporting by the provinces. 
The Punjab government has been complaining about the missing discharge gauges — basic tool for measuring inflows and outflows of water at the barrages and indicating losses during water travel. “Without those gauges, the entire reporting is theoretical. How could Irsa, or for that matter any planning body, base its planning (and that too on an issue as critical as water distribution) on the non-existent realities,” wonders Punjab, demanding that Irsa first get its data right and then allocate water to the provinces. 
Dispute over water measurements erupted between the Punjab and Sindh during planning for water distribution for the Kharif period, especially early Kharif when country suffers highest shortages and each drop of it becomes a basis for dispute. During these preparatory meetings, Sindh claimed to have suffered 35 per cent transmission losses in its 600 miles canals stretch. 
Punjab refused to accept the figure, saying it was having less than 10pc losses in its 2,600 miles long canals. How could Sindh losses be three times high in one-fifth of canal stretch? It pleaded for allowing 20pc losses to Sindh, which were first 10 years average after Water Apportionment Accord in 1991. The Irsa, however, agreed to 30pc losses to Sindh.",Pakistan
"Weekly inflation falls
","June 5, 2021","ISLAMABAD: Weekly inflation for the combined group in the period ended on June 3 fell by 0.61 per cent on the back of a slight decline in prices of essential food items, data released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) on Friday showed.
This will be the second consecutive week when the weekly inflation fell slightly on the back of drop in prices of perishable products. The PBS calculates the Sensitive Price Index (SPI) based on the prices of 51 essential items from 50 markets across 17 cities of the country.
For the lowest income group earning below Rs17,732 per month, the SPI decreased by 0.47pc, while for those who are earning above Rs44,175 it recorded a decline of 0.55pc.
This was mainly due to a decline in prices of food items including garlic chicken 16.75pc, bananas 9.80pc, pulse moong 1.71pc, wheat flour 0.75pc; rice Irri-6/9 0.73pc, pulse gram 0.14pc and pulse mash 0.12pc.
The items whose prices increased during the week included LPG 19.21pc, tomatoes 9.70pc, garlic 5.51pc, onions 2.78pc, potatoes 2.35pc and eggs 2.07pc.

"Nepra for expanding renewable energy footprint to 30pc
","June 5, 2021","			
 
Addressing a live webinar on “Pakistan’s Energy Transition and the Road Ahead” hosted by K-Electric and Nepra, he said the current share of hydropower at 30pc should be included in the renewable energy mix which would enable Pakistan’s total progress in the renewable energy space to exceed 60pc in next ten years. This should result in an environmentally friendly and affordable energy mix in the country, he added.
“For renewable industry to innovate and thrive, Pakistan needs a transition in its generation, transmission and distribution system. Nepra has been constantly working to bring that very change and its actions are louder than words,” Mr Farooqi highlighted. 
In her opening remarks, KE Chief Strategy Officer Naz Khan revealed that currently renewables have around 250MW of share in the utility’s total energy mix including almost 150MW from wind and 100MW from solar energy. She added that additional projects are in pipeline to increase the share of renewables to 350MW. 
While moving accordingly as per guidelines and policies set by the federal government, KE looks forward to continuously increasing the share of renewables in its energy mix in the buildup to 2030, she said, adding that KE has stepped into the renewable energy space with the launch of its first ever subsidiary – K-Solar – which is another step to a greener and more sustainable future for our future generations. 
Alternate Energy Development Board CEO Shah Jahan Mirza said that allowing purchase of power from solar and wind energy projects through competitive bidding remained one of the strong features of their new policy. This had never been done in Pakistan before, he claimed.
State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Director of IH&SMEFD Dr Mian Farooq Haq said the central bank had introduced a financing scheme in 2016 to lend support in addressing climate change issues and to promote renewable energy. 
The scheme is continuing to offer varied financing options ranging from Rs400 million to Rs6 billion for a broad category of entities and individuals. As of February 2021, financing of around Rs36bn has been extended to over 500 projects,” he added.",Newspaper
"Australian clubs pull out of Asian Champions League
","June 5, 2021","KUALA LUMPUR: Three Australian clubs have pulled out of the 2021 Asian Champions League amid an interrupted domestic season prolonged by the Covid-19 pandemic. 
The Asian Football Confederation issued a statement on Friday saying it taken note of Football Federation Australia’s confirmation of the withdrawals of Sydney FC, Melbourne City and Brisbane Roar from the continental club championship after an A-League overhaul caused scheduling clashes. 
“The matter will now be referred to the relevant AFC committees, with a decision to be communicated in due course,” the AFC said in a statement. 
The AFC did not give a reason for the withdrawals but Australia’s top flight A-League announced earlier on Friday it had rejigged its schedule because of an outbreak of Covid-19 in the southern state of Victoria. 
All three clubs placed in the top six in the A-League regular season to qualify for the playoffs, which start June 11 and are scheduled to conclude on June 26. 
Brisbane were due to face Philippine team Kaya FC-Iloilo on June 20 in the Champions League preliminary round, and Melbourne were to play Japan’s Cerezo Osaka the following day.

"Plea seeking  PSP chief’s disqualification from past public offices dismissed
","June 5, 2021","KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Friday dismissed a petition seeking disqualification of former Karachi mayor and Pak Sarzameen Party chairman Syed Mustafa Kamal from the public offices he previously held.
A two-judge bench headed by Justice Mohammad Ali Mazhar observed that the petitioner attempted to challenge the previous public offices at a belated stage and sought disqualification from 2002, which was not possible due to an inordinate delay and deep slumber on his part.
Former Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan MNA Salman Baloch filed the petition stating that Mr Kamal remained an employee of the Karachi Medical and Dental College and alleged that he was dismissed from service in 2002 but he concealed the employment in his nomination papers filed in 2002 for the election of MPA as well as in 2005 for the election of local bodies.
The bench in its judgement said that seemingly the respondent was not holding any public office since 2010 and the petitioner had also failed to rationalise if he was so passionate and ardent in the public interest or wanted to act as a whistleblower then why he maintained prolonged muteness during the period when the PSP chief was holding different public offices.
The bench questioned why after the lapse of his tenure, the petition was filed in 2020 with the entreaty that the respondent should be declared disqualified from the beginning or inception of his first public office, which he possessed pursuant to first nomination papers.
It observed that after surveying all the judgements of the apex court cited by the petitioner in support of his petition, it found them distinguishable to the facts and circumstances of the case in hand as in no case the public offices of the incumbents were challenged after the lapse or expiry of their tenures.
“The petitioner attempted to challenge the past public offices and filed this petition at belated stage on 16.1.2020 when the respondent No.1 is not holding any public office and his disqualification as prayed from the date of filing nomination papers on 24.10.2002 for contesting elections of provincial assembly, his nomination papers for contesting elections of local government and in 2005 for City Nazim is not physically possible due to inordinate delay and deep slumber on the part of petitioner”, it concluded.
Earlier, the petitioner argued that Mr Kamal was elected as an MPA on the ticket of MQM in 2002, city nazim of Karachi in 2005 and also given ticket for election of Senate in 2013 but from his very first election he was not qualified as he failed to fulfil the qualifications specified under Article 62 of the Constitution as he concealed his employment with KMDC.",Pakistan
"Sugar factories control, other bills passed in contravention of rules
","June 5, 2021","LAHORE: The Punjab Assembly on Friday passed the Sugar Factories (Control) (Amendment) Bill 2021 and five other bills bulldozing all rules of procedure and conventions amid protest by the opposition.
The chair being held by Panel of Chairman Mian Muhammad Shafi, in a rare move suspended the rules pertaining to taking up Question Hour and followed by Zero Hour immediately after recitation from the Quran and Na’at at the initiation of the house proceedings, and allowed the law minister to move and get passed six draft laws and introduce two more bills.
The bills passed were the Sugar Factories (Control) (Amendment) Bill 2021, the Companies Profits (Workers’ Participation)(Amendment) Bill 2020, the Punjab Overseas Pakistanis Commission Bill 2020, the Punjab Apprenticeship Bill 2021, the Punjab Educational Institutions (Reconstitution) Bill 2021, and the University of Child Health Sciences, Lahore Bill 2021.
The newly introduced bills were the Punjab Home-Based Workers Bill 2021, and the Punjab Shops and Establishments (Amendment) Bill 2021.
Like on May 4, when the Sugar Factories Bill 2021 had been passed without circulating its draft among the lawmakers or Press Gallery members, none of the bills passed today were circulated in the house.
The government kept the matters so secret that the agenda for the day was issued well after 9am, the time for starting house proceedings on Fridays. As per parliamentary convention, the agenda is released a day before so that legislators may come prepared accordingly.
Contrary to the Rule 5(1) of the Rules of Procedure, the chair also ignored the lack of quorum pointed out by the opposition, which was trying to use the ploy to delay the legislation for another day. The rush and secrecy shown by the government in getting the bills passed raised concerns among many who smell a rat particularly in the one related to the sugar industry.
Senior opposition lawmaker Samiullah Khan tells 
 that the vested interests are having a field day in safeguarding their interests in the absence of standing committees, though the incumbent assembly is going to complete its third out of five years of life.  
He says that almost 40 out of 60 bills including the six passed on Friday, enacted by the incumbent government, had the stamp of approval of special committees in which only three out of 15 members are from the opposition. These three also boycott proceedings of such ‘illegal’ bodies.
The six bills, he says, were presented before the Special Committee-9 as a formality in a brief sitting held a day ago (on Thursday) and till late night were not made part of the agenda for Friday’s sitting of the house.
Stressing that the government has mala fide intentions regarding the legislation, he says that the bills have been presented on the last day of the 32nd session which commenced on May 18 so that the members may not discuss these threadbare.  
On May 4 sugar industry bill was contrary to an earlier ordinance which had protected rights of sugarcane growers by empowering the provincial government to fix a date for start of cane crushing season, binding payments to growers through formal banking channels and authorizing the cane commissioner to determine liability of a miller for payment of cane price within a specified time and in case of failure recover the amount as land arrears.",Pakistan

"Why India should repeal its colonial-era sedition law
","June 5, 2021","Yesterday the Supreme Court of India, after quashing a sedition case registered by the Himachal Police against veteran journalist Vinod Dua, ruled that no journalist could be arrested on sedition charges merely for harshly criticising the government.  
The sedition case against Dua was filed after he put up a YouTube video in March 2020 criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government for the 
 during last year's lockdown.  
Quashing the case, Justices U. U. Lalit and Vineet Saran upheld the right of every journalist to criticise, even brutally, the measures of the government with a view to improving or altering them through legal means. The judgment stated that the right to utter honest and reasonable criticism is a source of strength to a community rather than a weakness. Upholding the Kedar Nath Singh case verdict of 1962, it said a citizen has the right to criticise the government without inciting people to violence. 
The pro-free speech judgment brings much hope. It makes one hark back to the poet Rabindranath Tagore’s ""Heaven of Freedom”, which says freedom from fear is the real freedom for any country. To be free and fair, journalism has to be fearless.
The sedition law, Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, is much feared. Free speech crusaders have long been demanding its repeal, citing wanton use of the law. The fear of sedition law has impeded the freedom of speech and media freedom. 
Governments have been in the habit of defending the use of the sedition law saying it is required to “tackle” terrorists, insurgents and secessionists. But there are other laws to deal with these problems. The journalism fraternity has often suggested that at least the courts issue guidelines for making arrests and filing cases under sedition law and other harsh laws such as the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act.
, verbal and physical assaults on them, framing them with criminal cases and denial of advertisements to “hostile” media houses that question the powers that be, are common in India. Journalists themselves generally view these as  “occupational hazards”. But the growing number of journalists booked under the sedition law is alarming. The law can muzzle the voices of dissent and harm democracy.
 
On January 17, 2021, editor-in-chief Dhiren Sadokpam and executive editor Paojel Chaoba of an online newspaper in the northeastern state of Manipur were arrested under the sedition law and the UAPA. Their offence was the publication of an article, “Revolutionary journey in a mess”. The author of the article,  M. Joy Luwang, was also arrested under the same laws. It was an opinion piece.
On January 28, 2021, 
 on several nationally known journalists, such as Rajdeep Sardesai of 
, Mrinal Pande of the 
, Zafar Agha of 
, and Paresh Nath and Vinod K. Jose of 
 magazine, for reporting that a farmer had died in police firing in Delhi on Republic Day. Farmers have been on a massive agitation in the national capital against recent legislation on sale of their produce and had laid siege to the Red Fort. Shashi Tharoor, MP, was also booked for sedition as he had tweeted that a farmer had died in police firing. The journalists and the MP had gone by early reports of a farmer’s death in police firing, but later the police declared that the death was due to a tractor accident, and not to any bullet.
The cases were registered under Indian Penal Code sections 124A (sedition); 295A (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs); 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace); 506 (criminal intimidation); 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention); and 120B (criminal conspiracy). The journalists were also booked under the Information Technology Act. All the journalists have been granted protection from arrest in the case.
The Editors Guild of India condemned the “intimidating” manner in which the cases were filed across five states ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party. Journalists condemned the “liberal use” of the sedition law at a joint press meeting organised by the Press Club of India (PCI), the Editors’ Guild of India, the Press Association, the Indian Women’s Press Corps (IWPC), the Delhi Union of Journalists and the Indian Journalists Union. “Often, the punishment for criticism of the government has been the long and exhausting legal process itself, as the sedition charge does not stand the scrutiny of law,” they lamented.
“This is a pathetic excuse on the part of the state governments concerned. In a moving story, things change on a regular basis. Accordingly, the reporting reflects the circumstances. When large crowds are involved and the air is thick with suppositions, suspicions and hypotheses, there can sometimes be a divergence between earlier and later reports. It is criminal to ascribe this to motivated reporting, as is sought to have been done,” stated the Press Club of India.
Seema Mustafa, the president of the Editor’s Guild, said, “What kind of journalism can be practised in times like these?”  She said, “These charges are meant not only to intimidate and harass the journalists but to also terrorise professionals, to make you afraid to do your job.”
The list of journalists booked under the sedition law is growing. In May 2020, Dhaval Patel, editor and owner of a Gujarati news portal, 
, was charged with sedition and detained by the police for publishing a report that suggested that the political leadership in the state would change. He was accused of spreading panic and charged under Section 54 of the Disaster Management Act (DMA). Four months later, the Gujarat High Court quashed the charges — Patel had tendered an unconditional apology.
On October 5, 2020, Siddique Kappan, a Delhi-based journalist working for a Malayalam news portal, 
, was arrested in Mathura when he tried to visit the family of a 19-year-old girl who was raped in the Hathras district of Uttar Pradesh. The police accused him of sedition saying he was part of a globally funded conspiracy to foment caste riots in Uttar Pradesh. Kappan continues to be in the Mathura jail, and the journalist fraternity calls it “arbitrary detention”.
In October 2020, Manipur-based journalist Kishore Chandra Wangkhem was arrested on charges of sedition for responding to a social media post by the wife of a BJP politician. He had been arrested in 2018 under the National Security Act and charged with sedition in another case. That was for criticising the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Chief Minister N. Biren Singh and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The High Court had quashed the charges then.
In May 2018 Kamal Shukla, editor of 
 of Chhattisgarh, was booked for sedition after he shared a cartoon on Facebook. The cartoon was about the Supreme Court’s observations on the death of a judge in 2014.
“There seems to be a common prism through which various state governments are seeing journalists,” Anand K. Sahay, president of the Press Council of India, said after sedition cases were filed against six journalists who reported the farmer’s death in police firing.
 
Besides journalists, a number of writers, activists and celebrities have been arrested under sedition laws in the past two decades. Some of the well-known cases are the ones filed against politician Praveen Togadia (2003), doctor Binayak Sen (2007), writer Arundhati Roy (2010), cartoonist Aseem Trivedi (2012), politician Hardik Patel (2015), actor Kangana Ranaut (2020). Each arrest sparked debate over the misuse of the “archaic” law, but to no effect.
The Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) sedition case (2016) was a turning point in the student movement in India. Three student leaders — Kanhaiya Kumar, Umar Khalid and Anirban Bhattacharya — were accused of allegedly chanting “anti-national” slogans during a demonstration in the university to mark the third anniversary of the execution of Afzal Guru, a medical student from Kashmir who was convicted of masterminding an attack on the Indian parliament in 2001. The three students spent several weeks in Tihar Jail in Delhi before they were granted bail, and they continue to attend hearings in the five-year-old case.
What has come as a shock is the fact that cases of sedition have been filed against ordinary people for what appear to be innocuous actions.
In January 2020, a play staged by students of the Shaheen Primary School in Bidar in the southern state of Karnataka 
 against the headmistress and the management of the school. The play was on the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which allegedly discriminates against Muslims. A ten-year-old girl from class six who appeared in the play allegedly mouthed “derogatory words” against the prime minister. The police arrested the girl’s mother, Najbunnisa, 35, and the headmistress, Fareeda Begum (52).
I met Najbunnisa inside the Bidar jail. The widow told me that she had moved to Bidar city from Hallikhed village (Humnabad district) to provide a good education for her daughter. “I don't know why I was arrested. How can an uneducated person like me teach my daughter about CAA or NRC (National Register of Citizens)?” she asked. Her tired eyes lit up only at the mention of her daughter. “My child is all alone at home.  I want to be released soon,” said Najbunnisa. She was granted bail more than a month after her arrest.
			
In February 2021, a tweet by the young climate activist Greta Thunberg in support of the ongoing farmer agitation in Delhi landed a 22-year-old climate activist in India, Disha Ravi, in the police net. The Delhi Police 
 from her Bengaluru residence on February 13 suspecting her role in creating and sharing a “toolkit” (a Google document with campaign information) for supporting the agitation. The cyber cell of the Delhi Police filed a case of sedition, criminal conspiracy and promoting hatred against the ""creators"" of the toolkit.
The police said it exposed a “conspiracy” by an organised overseas network to ""instigate"" the farmer protests, especially the Republic Day violence in Delhi. It was created by a Canada-based pro-Khalistani organisation called Poetic Justice Foundation and had a proper ""action plan"" for a digital strike and it called for physical protests before Indian embassies and local government offices, said the police. Two other activists, Shantanu Muluk and lawyer Nikita Jacob, they said, were part of the conspiracy. Disha was released on bail after 10 days.
A graduate in business administration from Mount Carmel College, Disha had launched, along with two friends, the Bengaluru chapter of the climate group, Fridays for Future, on March 15, 2019. A year before her arrest, she talked to me in January 2020 about her passion for environment. Practising sustainability, veganism and minimalism, she said, was the first lesson for a climate activist. How ironical that Disha, who cared for the planet, was charged with sedition, for “waging a proxy war” against the country!
Once out on bail, Disha took to Twitter to talk about her climate activism and her support to the farmer agitation. “It is about being radically inclusive of all groups of people, so that everyone has access to clean air, food and water,” she wrote.
			
Activist lawyer Prashant Bhushan had tweeted: ""When one sees how young, selfless public-spirited activists like #DishaRavi & #NodeepKaur are being arrested in India today, I am reminded of the story of Sophie Scholl who was beheaded by guillotine in Nazi Germany for resisting the Nazis.”
			
In February 2020, Amulya Leona, a 20-year-old journalism student in Bengaluru, who chanted “Pakistan Zindabad” during her speech at a protest against CAA and NRC, was charged with sedition. Leona was sharing the dais with the politician Asaduddin Owaisi, president of the All India Majlis — Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen. Her action came as a shock to the organisers of the event, and they rushed to the mike and cut her short. Leona said she believed the whole world was one and that she had intended to salute all countries to make her point, but could not do so because the organisers had intervened. She spent three months in jail before she got bail.
The sedition law in India was drafted by Thomas Babington Macaulay and was included in the Indian Penal Code in 1870, as the Section 124A. The section seeks to prosecute persons for sedition if their “words, either spoken or written, or by any signs, or by visible representation, or otherwise, brings or attempts to bring into hatred or contempt, or excites or attempts to excite disaffection towards the Government established by law”. The punishment for sedition is three years jail time which can extend to jail for life, along with the fine.
In pre-independent India, nationalist leaders like Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Mahatma Gandhi were charged with sedition by the British for writing against the government. In 1897, Tilak became the first political personality to be persecuted under the sedition law thrice. He spent six years in jail for his “seditious” speeches and writings in his newspaper, ""
”,  which allegedly incited hatred against the British government.
On March 10, 1922, Gandhi was arrested for sedition in three of his articles that appeared in his weekly, “
”. These articles were titled ‘Tampering with Loyalty’, ‘The Puzzle and its Solution’, and ‘Shaking the Manes’ and allegedly promoted “disaffection” towards the government. The Bombay High Court sentenced Gandhi to six years of imprisonment, but he was released after two years in view of his poor health.
“Section 124A under which I am happily charged is perhaps the prince among the political sections of the IPC. Affection cannot be manufactured or regulated by law,” Gandhi had said.
When Jawaharlal Nehru was the prime minister, Parliament amended Article 19(2) substantially. It broadened its scope by including “public order"" among the permissible grounds for restriction of free speech and narrowed its operation by adding the word “reasonable"" before “restrictions"".
Before the amendment to Article 19(2), the Punjab High Court had already held that sedition was incompatible with free speech in a democratic republic, and had struck it down as unconstitutional.
The constitutional validity of Section 124A was challenged in the Allahabad High Court when one Ram Nandan challenged his conviction for an inflammatory speech. The court overturned his conviction and declared Section 124A to be ""unconstitutional"".
In a landmark judgment by the Supreme Court in the Kedar Nath Singh versus State of Bihar case in 1962, the court held that the sedition law was ""constitutional"" and observed that ""the feeling of disloyalty to the government established by law or enmity to it imports the idea of tendency to public disorder"".
Subsequent regimes in free India have failed to repeal the sedition law, though sedition and seditious libel have been abolished even in Britain under Section 73 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009.
The freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Article19(1)(a) to the press covers the right to criticise the government, as well as the right to hold unpopular or unconventional views. But the liberal interpretation and use of sedition law, where criticism of the government is being construed as disaffection towards the state, has created a grey area. That is perhaps the reason why many sedition cases do not stand the scrutiny of law.
The Law Commission headed by a former Supreme Court judge, B. S. Chauhan, had recommended that it was time to rethink or even repeal the provision of sedition from the Indian Penal Code. It had also stated that an “expression of frustration over the state of affairs cannot be treated as sedition”.
In post-independence India, an ""error"" in judgment while reporting news, a hasty tweet or a Facebook post or an ""unverified"" scroll in a television channel (in the mad race to be the first to report) can land a journalist in deep trouble, attracting charges of sedition too.
According to the National Crime Records Bureau, 47 cases of sedition were booked in 2014. The number of cases dropped to 30 in 2015, rose steadily to 35 in 2016 and to 51 in 2017, and jumped to 70 in 2018.
In a reply in the Rajya Sabha in March this year, Union minister of state for home G. Kishan Reddy said 93 cases of sedition had been registered in 2019. He said 96 people had been arrested, and charge-sheets were filed against 76 people and the courts acquitted 29 persons.
The media site 
 keeps tabs on failures of justice and deficiencies in the legal system. According to it, there have been 816 cases of sedition registered since 2010. Of these, 65 per cent were charged after May 2014.
As many as 279 cases were booked and 3,762 individuals charged with sedition during the Manmohan Singh government (2010-2014). But 519 sedition cases against 7,136 individuals were booked during the Modi government (2014-2020). The highest numbers of cases were in Bihar (168), Tamil Nadu (139), Uttar Pradesh (115), Jharkhand (62) and Karnataka (50). A majority of cases were booked during the agitation against the Kudankulam nuclear power plant, farmer agitations, anti-CAA protests, Patidar and Jat agitations, and protests relating to Covid, the rape-murder in Hathras and the terrorist attack in Pulwama in which 40 paramilitary personnel were killed in February 2019.
Legal experts say that the sedition law has no place in a democracy as the Indian Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and expression. Dissent and criticism are what make the democracy robust.
Says Harish Narasappa, lawyer and founder of the civil society organisation DAKSH: “The sedition law has always been misused. But over the last few years, there has been an increase in the cases filed. There is hardly any party which has not misused this law to crush dissent. But a government with heavy majority gets emboldened to use this law more frequently. The judiciary not being responsive enough to protect the citizen rights is also a worrying development. Such laws have no place in a democracy as the people have the right to protest against an elected government.”
It is a fact all the previous regimes too have used the sedition law indiscriminately against writers, activists and students. But some political parties like the Congress and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) are now in favour of repealing the “redundant” law.
The Congress election manifesto 2019 promised repeal of the sedition law. Rajeev Gowda, MP and convener of the Congress manifesto committee, had defended the party’s stand saying, “Sedition law has been misused a lot against journalists, university students and environmental activists and it is crushing the right to dissent. We are concerned about the national security and anti-terrorism issues. But there are other laws like Defence of India Act, the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act to tackle them with safeguards. Sedition law has become redundant because of subsequent laws.”
Prime Minister Modi was quick to ridicule the Congress manifesto. He said during an election rally in Arunachal Pradesh: “The Congress wants to encourage those who burn the Tricolour or chant 
 (we will break up India), or those who play into foreign hands, those who disrespect our Constitution, break the statue of Babasaheb Ambedkar (leader of the Constitution drafting committee). Tell us, should we not have a sedition law to deal with those who work against the country?”
“There is no merit in a majority of cases filed under Section 124A, but the ruling party achieves what it intended to — crushing dissent. Despite the Supreme Court’s guidelines, the police continue to file cases under Section 124A and the lower courts admit them. The cases do not stand the scrutiny of law. But here, the legal process is the punishment,” says Harish Narsappa.  Speedy trial, as guaranteed under Article 21, is the only hope as of now, he says.
The courts admit sedition cases as they are booked under the existing laws, and it is the prerogative of the legislature (Parliament) to push for its repeal. While, many elected representatives admit in private that the law should be repealed, there has been no wider consensus in Parliament, as it suits those in power.
""The Congress party promising to scrap the sedition law in their manifesto is a welcome move and it needs wider consensus in Parliament. But the Congress is as guilty as other parties, as it had the opportunity to repeal it when in power,"" says Harish.
The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) joined forces with the International Press Institute (IPI) and gave a joint call for the Indian authorities to take urgent action to prevent the increasing use of sedition laws and other legal sanctions to threaten and silence independent journalists.
“Charges of sedition against journalists and activists for reporting or commenting on the protests, and attempts to curb freedom of expression on social media, are disturbing departures from essential human rights principles,"" said Michelle Bachelet, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, during the 46th session of the Human Rights Council while referring to the farmers' protest in India.
India is ranked 142 among 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index 2020. In its annual Freedom in the World report released on March 3, US-based NGO Freedom House 
 from the “free” to the “partially free” category.
Sweden-based V-Dem Institute said India was no longer an “electoral democracy” and classified the country as an “electoral autocracy”. It said much of the decline in democratic freedoms occurred after the BJP’s victory in 2014. The independent research institute, based at the University of Gothenburg, has been publishing data-based worldwide democracy reports since 2017.
External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar slammed them for their “hypocrisy” and called them “self-appointed custodians of the world who find it very difficult to stomach that somebody in India is not looking for their approval”. Citing the supply of Covid vaccines to more than 70 countries by India’s “nationalist” government, he wondered about the contribution of “internationalist countries”.
The free speech debate, it appears, can never be conclusive.

"Ex-BISP chief Farzana Raja declared proclaimed offender
","June 8, 2021","ISLAMABAD: The Accountability Court of Islamabad on Monday declared former chairperson of the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) Farzana Raja a proclaimed offender.
Judge Syed Asghar Ali issued non-bailable warrants for Ms Raja’s arrest and asked the interior ministry to block her computerised national identity card (CNIC) besides placing her name on the exit control list (ECL).
The court separated her case and fixed June 14 for indictment of the rest of the accused persons. The judge also summoned the investigation officer of the reference on the next date of hearing.
According to the 32-page reference against the Pakis­tan Peoples Party leader and others, a complaint was received in the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) alleging that the BISP had awarded contracts to advertising agencies in 2009-10 and 2010-11 in violation of the Public Procurement Rules (PPR), 2004.
It was further alleged that Rs1.657 billion was awarded to one advertising agency, Midas (Private) Limited.
The Executive Board Meeting of NAB authorised an inquiry on May 23, 2014 which was subsequently upgraded into investigation.
It further said that the evidence collected during the investigation had established that Ms Raja and others being public office holders pre-qualified advertising agencies in 2009 and awarded the media campaign of the BISP in violation of the PPR, 2004 as well as PID guidelines and released media payments against the alleged exaggerated fake bills submitted by the suspects and committed the offence of corruption and corrupt practices.
It may be mentioned that in January this year, co-accused Salman Khalid has turned approver against the BISP chief. In his application he expressed willingness to testify as witness in this case.",Pakistan
"PM inaugurates polio vaccination campaign
","June 8, 2021","			
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Monday expressed the hope that Pakistan would soon become a “polio-free” country as only one case of the paralysing disease was reported in the country during the current year.
The prime minister kicked off the polio eradication campaign by administering vaccination drops to some children. He expressed satisfaction over sharp decline in new polio cases.
			
“With well-coordinated efforts of the federal and provincial governments, Pakistan can become a polio-free country,” the prime minister said while chairing a meeting of the National Task Force on Polio Eradication which was attended by Governor of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Shah Farman, Punjab Chief Minister Sardar Usman Buzdar, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, KP Chief Minister Mahmood Khan, Gilgit-Baltistan Chief Minister Mohammad Khalid Khursheed, PM’s Special Assistant Dr Shahbaz Gill, Engineer-in-Chief Pakistan Army Lieutenant General Moazzam Ijaz, provincial chief secretaries and representatives of the Ministry of Health and global partners.
Congratulating the provincial governments and the partners for the polio eradication campaign, he said surfacing of a single case across the country this year was a great success. “However, their mission is to make Pakistan a complete polio-free country,” he added.
The meeting was apprised that due to effective strategy of the federal and provincial governments, only one polio case had been reported from Balochistan this year. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the polio immunization campaign had been slow.
Prime Minister Khan said during the pandemic, the government saved human lives along with securing livelihood of the people, which was acknowledged by the world. “With such spirit, they (all stakeholders) would have to defeat polio,” he added.
It was informed in the meeting that in different districts of Punjab, Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces, traces of poliovirus were found. Due to issues of access, security and non-cooperation of parents, every year, a large number of children were deprived from being administered polio drops.
The meeting was told that information and technology was being utilised along with geographical information system and tracking in this regard.
Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Global Development president Dr Chris Elias lauded the prime minister and the government for achieving a significant milestone in the polio eradication campaign.
The chief ministers apprised the meeting about the measures taken in their respective provinces with regard to polio eradication drive.
The prime minister also expressed his gratitude to global partners, including World Health Organisation, Rotary International and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, for extending technical and financial support to the country.
Earlier, the prime minister administered anti-polio drops to children while inaugurating fresh countrywide polio campaign at Prime Minister House.
Prime Minister Khan also launched a mobile service of National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) to provide loans to the people who wanted to have their dream house under the PM’s Mera Ghar Programme.
The NBP service called “Mera Pakistan Mera Ghar” was launched under which mobile vans of the bank will move to remote and far-flung areas where proper banking facility is not available and will provide one-window facility to process house loan cases.
It is believed that some commercial banks will follow suit and launch their own mobile services to make PM’s housing programme successful.",Pakistan
"NZ won’t be haunted by World Cup agony: Williamson
","June 8, 2021","LONDON: New Zealand captain Kane Williamson said his team will carry no scars from their agonising loss to England in the 2019 World Cup decider when they take on India in the final of the World Test Championship (WTC) in Southampton on June 18. 
England were crowned 50-overs world champions in 2019 via a controversial boundary-count rule, which has since been scrapped, after the final ended in a tie even after a Super Over. 
Williamson is back in England chasing Test cricket’s biggest honour and the 30-year-old said the New Zealand team was not haunted by the heartbreak of two years ago. 
“No, I do not think so, certainly not something that the guys have spoken about,” Williamson told the International Cricket Council (ICC), pointing out ‘a different side’ would be playing a ‘different format’ at the Ageas Bowl. “The focus is definitely on the transition from not playing much cricket or from where the guys who have played white-ball cricket to just change into that Test format.”    
“The match ... was a very memorable one and obviously it had some controversy and it had everything, and people loved watching it at the end of the day. That is why people got a lot out of it,” he said of the 2019 encounter. 
New Zealand won their home series against India last year but Williamson would not underestimate an opponent who overcame a litany of injuries to triumph in Australia this year. 
“Throughout we have seen the depth they have as well, certainly saw that in Australia as well,” Williamson said of the India team under Virat Kohli. “A lot of strengths in their fast bowling and spin department ... a brilliant side, ranked right up the top, which is fair enough and an exciting opportunity for us to be involved in the final taking on the best.”",Newspaper

"Jahangir’s Tomb needs Rs100m for complete conservation
","June 8, 2021","LAHORE: Mughal Emperor Jahangir’s Tomb at Shahdara needs urgent and comprehensive conservation costing around Rs100m to save the monument from further decay. 
The conservation would include decorative work at red sandstone facade, lawn development, beautification, fresco work and paintings, sources in the Directorate General of Archeology and Tourism Department told 
.  
They said the Jahangir’s Tomb could be declared a monument on World Heritage List but that requires the mandatory 200 foot buffer zone. The zone could not be ensured right now owing to massive encroachments around the monument. 
The sources said earlier funds worth Rs10m were released for the fiscal year 2020-2021 and with these funds walkways, red sandstone minarets and eroded boundary wall on eastern side of the tomb got conserved.  
“For comprehensive conservation of the monument Rs100m are required,” said Muhammad Naeem Iqbal, the project director of Shahdara Complex of Monuments. He hoped that in the upcoming budget sufficient allocations would be made through which monuments of great significance could be conserved comprehensively.  
The causes of the constant decay of the monument include water, humidity, temperature, growth of plants in the immediate vicinity of the monument, woodworms, fungi, white ants and termites, floods, water pours inundation and other disorderly water flow, fire and earthquakes. 
The mausoleum over his grave was erected by Jahangir’s son and successor Shah Jahan. It took 10 years (1627-37) to complete at the cost of Rs1m. The marble cenotaph with the delicate and colourful pietra dura work engraved with the 99 attributes of God, the late emperor’s name and the date of his death all in calligraphy is also a fine example of workmanship in marble. 
The Shahdara Complex of Monuments, situated on the right bank of the river Ravi, comprises of the most important Mughal edifices in Pakistan. The main monument within the complex is the tomb Jahangir.  
Emperor Jahangir was born in 1569AD and ascended the throne in 1605AD at the ripe age of 36. After reign of 22 years, he died on Oct 28, 1627 at Rajouri in Kashmir on his way back to Lahore.  
According to his last wish, he was buried at Lahore in a significant royal garden known as ‘Dilkusha,’ owned by his favourite wife Nur Jahan.",Pakistan
"NEC approves 40pc hike in development spending for FY22
","June 8, 2021","ISLAMABAD: Amid dissent by Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, the National Economic Council (NEC) on Monday set next year’s economic growth rate target at 4.8 per cent to be supported by Rs2.135 trillion consolidated development outlay — about 40pc higher than current year’s revised budget of Rs1.527tr.
The meeting of the NEC — the highest economic decision-making body in the country — was presided over by Prime Minister Imran Khan. Chief ministers of all the provinces and other members of the NEC participated in the meeting.
The Prime Minister Office said the meeting also approved Macroeconomic Framework for Annual Plan 2021-22 envisaging growth target of 4.8pc, with sectoral growth targets of 3.5pc for agriculture, 6.5pc for industrial sector, and 4.7pc for services sector.
The meeting was informed by the Planning Commission that revised estimate for the total development outlay of the ongoing year was Rs1.527tr. For next year, it approved consolidated national development programme of Rs2.135tr, including Rs1.235tr worth of annual development plans (ADPs) of the four federating units.
The federal Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) for 2021-22 was approved at Rs900bn compared to Rs650bn allocation for the current year, showing an increase of 38.5pc. The PSDP 2021-22 also included Rs101bn foreign funding in the shape of loans and grants.
On the other hand, the cumulative ADPs of the four provinces was set at Rs1.235tr which is almost 41pc higher than current year’s revised estimates of Rs877bn. The provincial ADPs of Rs1.235tr also involve foreign exchange component of about Rs192bn. As such, the overall national development portfolio for next year is estimated at Rs2.135tr including a total foreign exchange component of Rs293bn.
Soon after the meeting, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah said he and his colleague Nisar Khoro protested during the meeting over step-motherly treatment being meted out to Sindh in allocation of development funds. “We recorded our strong protest over this severe injustice. The provinces had not been consulted before inclusion of a few schemes in the PSDP. We fear this will result in corruption,” he said outside the Sindh House.
He said without the consent of the Sindh government, this development budget could not be approved by the parliament and he told this to prime minister to record his protest and dissent. He said the prime minister was also asked to make part of the NEC proceedings a formal dissenting letter he would be sending in a day or two. He said the prime minister conceded that consultation had not been done with provinces in the finalisation of the development programme and yet he took no step to address the situation.
He said the development funds which used to be given to the province had been drastically reduced. Mr Shah said they did not have very good relations with the previous PML-N government either but the PSDP allocations for Sindh in their last year stood at Rs27bn which were reduced to Rs14bn, followed by Rs9bn and Rs8bn since then. For 2021-22, this has been slashed further to Rs5.1bn.
In comparison, Mr Shah said other smaller provinces had been given Rs20bn each and Rs44bn for Punjab. He said he was happy that allocations for other provinces had been increased but this was unfair to allocate a meagre amount for Sindh’s development projects.
He alleged that funds had been allocated for union council Halepoto while ignoring the rest of the people of the province. He said the federal government had once said Sindh did not belong to them and this time they had proved it with their actions. He said the prime minister did not let him speak freely in the meeting.
The Prime Minister Office said total PSDP of Rs900bn included Rs244bn for Transport & Communications, Rs118bn for energy, Rs91bn for water resources, Rs113bn for social sector, Rs100bn for regional equalisation, Rs31bn for science and technology & IT sector, Rs68bn for SDGs and Rs17bn for production sector.
The council was informed that the focus of PSDP will be on infrastructure improvement, water resources development, social sector improvement, regional equalisation, skill development, promotion of science and technology, and IT, as well as climate change mitigation measures.
The meeting was informed that the PSDP would cater to the government’s plans to increase focus on lagging areas and regions.
The NEC was also informed that with the operationalisation of the Public Private Partnership Authority (P3A), a number of PPP projects are also being expeditiously processed for implementation. These include Sukur-Hyderabad Motorway and Sialkot-Kharian Motorway, which are at an advanced stage
while other major projects such as Karachi Circular Railway (KCR), KPT-Pipri Freight Corridor, Kharian-Rawalpindi Motorway, Balkasar-Mianwali Road, Quetta-Karachi-Chaman Highway were also likely to be launched during the year.",Newspaper
"US recovers $2.3m in bitcoin paid to hackers
","June 8, 2021","WASHINGTON: The US Justice Department on Monday said it recovered some $2.3 million worth of cryptocurrency ransomware paid by Colonial Pipeline Co, in a crackdown on hackers who launched the most disruptive US cyber attack on record.
Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said investigators had seized 63.7 bitcoins, now valued at about $2.3 million, paid by Colonial after last month’s hack of its systems that led to massive shortages at US east coast gas stations.
The Justice Department has “found and recaptured the majority” of the ransom paid by Colonial, Monaco said.
Colonial Pipeline had said it paid the hackers nearly $5 million to regain access. Bitcoin’s value has dropped in recent weeks, trading at around $36,000 on Monday after hitting $63,000 in April.
“Today, we’ve turned the tables on DarkSide,” said Monaco, referring to a ransomware group widely believed to have been behind the crippling fuel pipeline attack.
The hack caused a shutdown lasting several days, leading to a spike in gas prices, panic buying and localized fuel shortages. It posed a major political headache for President Joe Biden as the U.S. economy was starting to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The White House urged corporate executives and business leaders last week to step up security measures to protect against ransomware attacks after the Colonial hack and later intrusions that disrupted operations at a major meatpacking company.
Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said on Sunday the Biden administration was looking at all options to defend against ransomware attacks and that the topic would be on the agenda when President Joe Biden meets Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva on June 16.",Newspaper
"Suu Kyi to go on trial next week
","June 8, 2021","NAYPYIDAW: Ousted Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi will go on trial next week, her lawyer said on Monday, with the Nobel laureate facing an eclectic raft of charges, from possessing unlicensed walkie-talkies to flouting coronavirus restrictions during elections last year.
Myanmar has been in uproar since Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy (NLD) government were ousted in a Feb 1 coup, with near-daily protests and a nationwide civil disobedience movement.
Almost 850 people have been killed by the military, according to a local monitoring group.
Suu Kyi, 75, will go on trial on Monday in Naypyidaw, where she is charged with violating restrictions during last year’s election campaign and possessing unlicensed walkie-talkies.
Proceedings will start on June 14 and are expected to wrap up by July 26, according to her legal team.
Suu Kyi’s lawyers have been allowed to meet with her just twice since she was placed under house arrest, with weeks of delays to her legal case.
“We will get testimonies from plaintiffs and witnesses starting from next hearing,” on Monday, lawyer Min Min Soe said after meeting her in the capital Naypyidaw.
Suu Kyi will also appear in a separate trial slated to begin on June 15, where she is charged with sedition alongside ousted president Win Myint and senior NLD leader Dr Myo Aung, the lawyer said.
There was a heavy police presence around the Naypyidaw council compound, close to where the court is located, with roadblocks along streets leading to the area, an 
 reporter said.
Suu Kyi “asked all (people) to stay in good health,” Min Min Soe added.
The ousted leader faces a separate charge of violating a colonial-era secrecy law — a case that is pending in a court in the commercial hub Yangon.
“Groundhog day again,” Myanmar analyst David Mathieson said, adding that proceedings in the junta-backed court would be little more than “a show trial.” “It’s all about an illegal regime discrediting a democratically elected leader on trumped up charges that would embarrass a tin pot dictatorship anywhere else.”
Suu Kyi spent more than 15 years under house arrest during the previous military rule before her 2010 release.
Her international stature diminished following a wave of military violence targeting Buddhist-majority Myanmar’s marginalised Muslim Rohingya community that displaced more than a million people, but the coup has returned Suu Kyi to the role of cloistered democracy icon.
Junta leader Min Aung Hlaing has justified his power grab by citing alleged electoral fraud in the November poll, which Suu Kyi’s NLD won in a landslide.
The junta has previously said it would hold fresh elections within two years, but has also threatened to dissolve the NLD.
The continuing violence in Myanmar has pushed some in the anti-junta movement to form a so-called “People’s Defence Force” (PDF) in their townships — made up of civilians who fight back against security forces with homemade weapons.
But they are often outnumbered and outgunned in clashes with Myanmar’s military — one of Southeast Asia’s most battle-hardened and brutal.
Around 70 protesters marched in a flashmob demonstration in the commercial capital Yangon Monday, images showed.
Flashing the three-fingered salute — a symbol of pro-democracy protests from Thailand to Hong Kong — they chanted “We want Democracy” as they passed down a city street, before quickly dispersing.",Newspaper
"WHO urges Covid jab makers to give Covax 50pc of doses

World Health Organisation Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said manufacturers should turn their attention to the Covax facility, which has struggled to get donation-funded doses to poorer countries. Tedros voiced his frustration that several poor countries have been unable to immunise their health workers, the elderly and other populations most vulnerable to severe Covid-19 disease.
Some rich countries meanwhile, having bought up vaccine supply, are drawing up preparations to start vaccinating children, he said.
Tedros has called for a massive global effort to vaccinate at least 10 percent of the population of all countries by September, and at least 30 percent by the end of the year.

"Death toll from Ghotki train tragedy rises to 65
","June 8, 2021","The death toll from the 
 rose to 65 on Tuesday after rescuers pulled more bodies from a mangled bogie found crushed underneath an engine a day after the crash, according to Ghotki SSP Umer Tufail. 
He said around 10 to 12 of the bodies retrieved on Tuesday were of persons who were travelling with a wedding party.
However, persons in-charge of the Edhi Centre in Sukkur, Mohammad Urs Magsi and Gul Mahar, told 
 that the death toll had risen to 62. 
They said over 100 persons injured in the accident were under treatment at different hospitals and many of them were in critical condition, fearing that the death toll may rise. 
The accident had taken place between the Raiti and Daharki railway stations where eight carriages of the Millat Express derailed just before the Sir Syed Express rammed into them in the early hours of Monday.
The collision resulted in the suspension of train service, with authorities offering refund for seats booked in advance.
Magsi and Mahar said a free ambulance service had been started on the directives of Edhi Foundation head Faisal Edhi to transport the bodies to the victims' hometowns and more than 35 bodies had already been sent. 
Meanwhile, some bodies had been shifted to a morgue at a hospital in Rahim Yar Khan, they added. 
According to them, most of the deceased were residents of Karachi, Lodhran, Rawalpindi and Vehari.
Meanwhile, Sukkur DSP Tariq Latif said the relief operation at the site of the accident was completed on Tuesday after the removal of the wreckage of a train engine and 17 coaches. 
He said instructions had been issued for the restoration of train service on the affected tracks after the completion of the relief operation. 
According to the DSP, the train service on the track had remained suspended for around 30 hours after the accident. The service  was restored on the upcountry track at 10am and on the down track at 12:40pm. 
""While the train service has been restored, locomotives are chugging at a slower speed [than the usual] on the affected track,"" he said. ""Trains are moving at a speed of 10 kilometres per hour on the [upcountry] track.""
			
Meanwhile, the departure of multiple Lahore-bound and Rawalpindi-bound trains — namely Allama Iqbal Express, Pakistan Express, Jinnah Express, Karakoram Express, Pak Business Express, Millat Express, Karachi Express, Tezgam,  Zakariya Express and Sir Syed Express — from Karachi was cancelled. 
According to a statement issued by the office of the Pakistan Railways divisional superintendent in Karachi, the departures were cancelled just for Tuesday on ""technical"" grounds and passengers who had confirmed tickets would be given refunds.  
The pre-dawn crash on Monday came as a grim reminder of the 2005 horrific accident on the same track in Sukkur railway division when three passenger trains had collided with each other, leaving at least 130 passengers dead and 170 others injured.
As per Pakistan Railways policy, according to a railways spokesperson, the authorities will be giving Rs1500,000 to the heirs of each deceased and between Rs50,000 and Rs300,000 to the injured as compensation.
According to early reports, the Millat Express was heading from Karachi to Sargodha when it derailed between Raiti and Daharki stations in Ghotki district at around 3.30am, spilling eight carriages onto the parallel track. A few minutes later, the Sir Syed Express from Rawalpindi, which was coming from the opposite direction, collided with those carriages.
Around 1,200 passengers were travelling on the two trains.
 
 
Local farmers and villagers were the first to arrive at the site in large numbers, some clambering on top of the overturned carriages in an attempt to reach survivors. They managed to pull out several bodies and trapped passengers before shifting them to hospitals, while some drove tractors close to the scene in an attempt to move the wreckage or to shift the injured.
Police and Rangers personnel, district administration officials and army troops, too, later arrived at the scene to take part in the rescue work.
More than 150 passengers, including 15 members of a marriage party going to Punjab from Sanghar, were injured. They were shifted to hospitals in Ghotki, Ubauro, Mirpur Mathelo and Shaikh Zayed Hospital in Rahim Yar Khan, where a state of emergency was declared while local people appealed for blood donations.
“We tumbled upon each other, but that was not so fatal,” Akhtar Rajput, a passenger on the train that derailed, told 
. “Then another train hit us from nowhere, and that hit us harder. When I regained my senses, I saw passengers lying around me, some trying to get out of the coach.”
Shahid, another passenger, said: “I was disoriented and trying to figure out what happened to us when the other train hit.”
Rescue work was earlier hindered due to darkness and unavailability of required heavy machinery. Also, around three hours were required to bring machinery there from the National Highway, which was 21km from the accident scene but the connecting track was rough and bumpy.
A total of 703 and 505 passengers were travelling in Millat Express and Sir Syed Express, respectively, according to the Pakistan Railways administration.
After the horrific collision, federal Minister for Railways Senator Azam Khan Swati arrived, reviewed rescue work and visited the hospitals where he inquired after the condition of the injured passengers.
Talking to journalists on the occasion, Senator Swati said he had not come for any photo session but he was actually ""saddened"" by the casualties. He said those found guilty in this railway incident would not be spared from strict disciplinary action.",Pakistan
"Cabinet rejects proposal to liaise with Indian company for live telecast of Pak-Eng cricket series
","June 8, 2021","The federal cabinet on Tuesday rejected a proposal of the Pakistan Television Corporation to liaise with an Indian company for live telecast of the upcoming Pakistan-England cricket series.
Addressing a press conference after the cabinet meeting, Federal Minister for Information Fawad Chaudhry said that the cabinet was requested to approve the partnership with an Indian company, which would enable the PTV to telecast the cricket series between Pakistan and England, scheduled to start from July 8, 2021. 
“However, the proposal has been rejected. Pakistan cannot undertake a partnership with any Indian company and our ties with the neighbouring country are subject to India reverting its Aug 5, 2019 decision [to restore Kashmir’s previous status].
He said that Pakistan would try to explore different options, including approaching the England Cricket Board and other foreign companies to secure broadcasting rights, but [regrettably] the rights have been reserved by Indian companies in South Asia. The minister underscored that the PTV and Pakistan Cricket Board would bear financial losses due to this decision.
Speaking about other decisions taken during the meeting, Chaudhry said the cabinet had also approved handing over the Pakistan Telephone Industries Haripur to National Radio Telecommunication Corporation for revamp and restructure. He said the decision in this regard was pending since 2006.
With regards to the train accident that occurred yesterday (June 7), the minister said, ""It is true that our railways system needs upgradation and it cannot be fixed in one or two years. This revamp requires long-term planning,"" he said, adding that instead of fixing the railways system, the previous government(s) had ‘frittered away’ Rs300 billion to launch the Orange Line train. ""Likewise, all state institutions were ruined through ill-planning and incompetence of the past governments.""
The federal minister said that the ML-1 project would help upgrade the entire railway network in the country.
In response to a question, he said the Federal Minister for Railways Azam Khan Swati had assured of immediate action against anyone responsible once the inquiry report was furnished.
The minister further said that Justice (retd) Zia Pervez had been appointed as member of the Commission Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances, while Amir Mohiuddin (BPS-20 officer) had been made chief executive officer of the Pakistan Housing Authority Foundation, he added.
The information minister told the press conference that the government was planning to introduce internet voting facility for overseas Pakistanis, adding that “it is part of the Act currently tabled in the parliament and we want the opposition to agree to it.”
Commenting on the current political situation, Fawad Chaudhry said, “Currently, PML-N and PPP are bickering with each other like kids. We want to talk with the opposition on national matters like electoral reforms, and the way Pakistan Peoples Party opposed the government's proposal for granting voting rights to overseas Pakistanis is their viewpoint, but we are not going to accept it.”
He believed that the opposition's politics was fading away, adding that the PPP never indulged in anti-Punjab politics as Bhutto rose through the same province, “but to their disappointment, they are even losing Sindh because of their bad governance.”
He said the PML-N's narrative on PTI's alleged failure on inflation control and economy mismanagement had also failed. Still, he said, we are ready for talks with the opposition, but there would be no compromise on accountability. “This [accountability] will be looked after by courts and relevant institutions.”
With regards to the Ehsaas Programme, Chaudhru said that the government had decided to make it more effective, and digitise its data for smooth operations. 
The minister said that Tariq Malik had been appointed as the Nadra Chairman after approval from the cabinet. Shedding light on other appointments, he said Umar Habib Lodhi had been reappointed as Director Utility Stores, adding the USC was now making Rs100bn sale and it had now stepped out of the financial crisis.
Similarly, he said the cabinet had approved the appointments of the Board of Directors and Chairperson First Woman Bank. Najeeb Agrawala will be new chairperson of the bank, while Bushra Ehsan, Sabiha Sultan, Akbar Ali, Wajahat Rasool Khan and Naghmana Alamgir Hashmi will serve as its board members. He said that Naveed Ismail had also been appointed as member of the K-Electric's board.
Responding to a question about presence of US military or air bases in Pakistan, Chaudhry said Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi had explained the government's policy on the Senate floor in this regard and there was no possibility of the existence of American bases in Pakistan. “In fact, there is no drone surveillance either and no such discussion is afoot to give Americans space on our land.”",Pakistan
"'Increase your profits, but avoid profiteering,' PM Imran tells industrialists
","June 8, 2021","Prime Minister Imran Khan on Tuesday reiterated his government’s commitment to support the agriculture sector for economic uplift, but at the same time asked industrialists to avoid profiteering and cartelisation that embroils public in inflation.
Addressing a delegation of farmers who called on him at the Prime Minister House today to discuss their issues, PM Imran said he firmly believed that the country would rise through the agriculture sector, and stressed upon the industrialists to “make profits, but avoid profiteering”. He asked them to not make cartels that ultimately burden the public with inflation. 
“I assure you the government will not let farmers be exploited and my team and I will keep in contact with you,” he told the farmers.
He said his government’s efforts had resulted in the timely payment for sugarcane crops to farmers during the crushing seasons, which was not the case previously.
He said he had asked his team to meet farmers and explore new innovations being employed by the world in the agriculture sector. “Until we modernise and upgrade our industries, we can’t move forward,” he remarked.
He said he grew up watching Pakistan’s rapid rise and also saw its quick decline due to ‘injustices’ in the country. “It is the law of the Almighty Allah that any nation that does justice to its people will rise and progress.”
The prime minister regretted that farmers were not getting their due share. “There was a mafia ruling in this sector and it was making the most of our corrupt system.”
He said corruption by rulers at the helm ultimately ruins the country. “And same is the story of all third world countries.”
He reiterated when corrupt leaders rule the roost, they make money and destroy the governance system, thus halting country’s progress.
PM Imran said his government had confronted the sugar mafia, which had also threatened the FIA of triggering a sugar shortage in the country if the investigation against them continued.
He insisted that the country would move upwards from that point on, adding that China had always extended its support for upgrading Pakistan’s agriculture sector.",Pakistan
"Opposition alarmed over disappearance of key human rights bills in black hole
","June 19, 2021","• Sherry claims countless progressive bills vanished from parliamentary agendas

• PTI lawmaker slams former rulers for extravagance 
 The opposition in the Senate on Friday expressed alarm over its key human rights (HR) bills disappearing in a black hole to emerge in the form of government bills. 
“A wrong practice is going on for quite some time which is a disincentive for members of the Senate who work hard on the bills with the civil society and their colleagues,” Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) parliamentary leader Senator Sherry Rehman said while raising the issue in the house. 
She regretted that instead of using parliamentary committees for scrutinising and reviewing bills, countless progressive bills had just vanished from parliamentary agendas under the PTI government. 
“It is shocking how my Bill, ‘Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Bill, 2020’, has been silently omitted from the agenda. ‘The Torture and Custodial Death (Prevention and Punishment) Act 2019’ has been cleared by the Senate committee but has not been placed for voting in the Senate whereas the ‘Child Marriage Restraint Bill 2019’ has also disappeared from the National Assembly despite being passed in the Senate,” the senator added. 
“When questions are asked in both the houses of the parliament, no one informs us of the progress. Why are the bills being omitted even after the smooth passage in one house of the parliament,” questioned Sherry Rehman. 
Highlighting the importance of the human rights bills, the senator said: “Instead of prioritising these bills, they have been silently omitted from the committee rooms. The relevant minister must supervise the smooth passage of the bills, and not put them on the back burner.” 
“What is more alarming is that our bills suddenly appear as the federal government’s bills in the end. The way bills have been tabled in the parliament is unprecedented. The government must inform the parliament regarding the current status of the disappearing bills. This is not how a parliamentary system works,” concluded PPP vice president Senator Sherry Rehman. 
PML-N’s Azam Nazir Tarar also touched upon the issue of ‘missing bills’. 
The issue was raised after the opposition blocked the attempt to bring two government bills in the house for passage through supplementary agenda. 
Standing Committee on Human Rights chairman Walid Iqbal had presented reports of the committee on the bills to establish an effective system of protection, relief and rehabilitation of women, children, elders and any vulnerable person against domestic violence [The Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Bill, 2021] and the bill to provide for the well-being, comfort and dignity of senior citizens residing in the Islamabad Capital Territory [The Islamabad Capital Territory Senior Citizens Bill, 2021] passed by the panel with amendments introduced by the opposition, but senators from the opposition insisted they wanted to go through the proposed changes. 
The matter was deferred till Monday. 
Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani said the upper house was not bound to comply with any agreement made by the National Assembly and it would move forward under the rules to take up any of those 21 bills that were earlier passed by the lower house. 
Taking part in the budget debate, PTI Senator Ejaz Ahmad Chaudhry criticised the previous governments for their extravagance. 
He said Prime Minister Imran Khan had moved forward with his agenda of cutting down government expense.  
Mr Chaudhry said that before 2018, the PM House’s expense was Rs590 million per annum but PM Khan spent Rs339 million in 2019 and Rs280 million in 2020. 
Similarly, before 2018, the PM Office was spending Rs514 million annually but the prime minister brought the expense down to Rs305 million in 2019 and Rs334 million in 2020, he added.  
Making a comparison between PM Khan’s foreign visits with his predecessors, Senator Chaudhry said the then president, Asif Ali Zardari, spent $11.73 million on 134 foreign visits, former PM Gilani spent $7.02 million on 47 tours, ex-PM Sharif’s 92 visits cost $17.7 million while PM Imran Khan spent only $1.3 million on 28 visits. 
“This is how public money was wasted on excursion tours,” the senator said.",Pakistan
"Safety should be top priority in production of quality vehicles, says Shibli
","June 19, 2021","KARACHI: The federal government is keen to set international standards for quality production of vehicles in the country with priority to their safety and in this regard it has given a special task to the Pakistan Standards and Quality Control Authority (PSQCA).
Federal Minister for Science and Technology Shibli Faraz while talking to reporters after visiting the PSQCA headquarters here said that the authority was bringing reforms in its functioning and soon its results would be seen on the ground.
“We have devised a special strategy for quality production of vehicles and [keeping] safety as our first priority,” he said.
“The PSQCA is already working on these lines and would further focus on this area. The authority keeps an eye on quality of some 166 products and all these are directly linked with common man’s life. We would bring more reforms and excellence in its working for better quality of all these products,” he said.
He said the government was focussing on technological support to bring transparency and enhance standards in key areas of daily life and PSQCA had an important role in this regard.
Earlier, Mr Faraz visited the office of Leader of the Opposition in the Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh and said that he was pleased to see the assembly which had played a crucial role in the creation of Pakistan. 
He thanked Mr Sheikh for inviting him. 
Speaking to media, the federal minister said that Prime Minister Imran Khan was the man who always treated all the federating units alike and dispelled the impression created by the Pakistan Peoples Party leadership that he and the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government were least interested towards issues of Sindh. 
He said that it was a matter of deep concern that the PPP government in Sindh, despite getting enough funds from the federal government, had done nothing to provide relief to the people, who according to him, were facing hardships even in getting drinking water. 
Mr Faraz said that it was the responsibility of the provincial government to provide basic amenities of life.
He lamented that the PPP despite ruling Sindh for the past 13 years had miserably failed to provide modern facilities to the people of the province.
“It is a matter of concern that Sindh is lagging far behind in development as compared to other provinces” he added, holding PPP rulers responsible for the poor state of affairs in Sindh. 
He said that the PTI government had earmarked huge funds for various districts of the province. He added that they would also bring change in the damaged infrastructure of Karachi.
“The people of Karachi gave us huge mandate during the previous general elections so it is our responsibility to launch projects in the city so that people could benefit,” he said and added it was a matter of deep concern that various localities of Karachi were facing water crisis. 
He said that he was shocked to learn that the supply of water of the constituency of Mr Sheikh was stopped on the orders of the Sindh chief minister.
He asked the PPP to refrain from such vindictive policies towards its political opponents. 
Mr Faraz said that by carrying out more schemes and projects in Karachi and other districts of Sindh they would not win more seats from Karachi but from other districts since the people of Sindh had already become sick of the corrupt and incompetent rulers. 
He said that the tigers of PM Imran Khan were fighting against the rampant corruption and those involved in such ugly practices. 
He said that it was a misconception and propaganda that Sindh’s water was being stolen by other provinces and asked the PPP to mend their ways and ensure availability of water to farmers of the province in a fair manner. 
He said that PTI leaders and workers had always raised their voice for the real issues of Sindh. ",Pakistan
"Murad seeks WB help for oxygen plant, procuring Covid-19 material
","June 19, 2021","KARACHI: Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Friday urged the World Bank to allow the provincial government to utilise $11 million saved from different projects for installation of an oxygen plant and procurement of other Covid-19 related equipment. 
This he said in his meeting with a Bank delegation led by country director Najy Benhassine.
The chief minister said the coronavirus pandemic had become a serious issue. 
“We have established a separate hospital, Institute of Infectious Diseases in Karachi and decided to establish similar facilities at all divisional headquarters,” he said. 
Mr Shah said that there was a dire need to establish an oxygen plant in Sindh to ensure uninterrupted supply of oxygen. 
“Requirement of oxygen has increased many times, and we plan to install an oxygen plant to cater to the needs of Covid patients,” he said. 
“The provincial government has also planned to procure 500 more ventilators for Covid-19 related hospitals,” he said. 
The provincial government has saved around $11m in different World Bank-funded projects. 
The World Bank country chief said that the Bank supported Covid-19 emergency and the request of the Sindh government was legitimate and would be considered.
 
The chief minister said that Sindh Barrages Improvement Project to rehabilitate and modernise Sukkur Barrage had been launched with the assistance of the Bank. 
He said that there were five components of the project, replacement of six gates of the barrage and associated works for which work was awarded to M/s Karachi Shipyard & Engineering Works Ltd in 2019 for Rs16.7 billion. 
He added that 66 per cent physical and 64pc financial progress had been achieved. 
He said that two gates of the main barrage and hoisting system had been installed and commissioned. 
He said that installation of one gate was under process and the remaining three gates would be installed by September. 
“The scope of the project includes repair of structures, embankment and surface protection, foundation inspection and repairs, building works, instrumentation and monitoring, electrical and mechanical works, CCTV and installation of communication systems,” he added. 
The CM said that the second component ‘Restoration of Sukkur Barrage’ would cost around Rs15,675 million.

He said that under the project animal production was increased up to 28.6pc. 
“Of the 153 MPGs, 149 have been helped with constructed chiller rooms and installation of milk chillers with allied equipment where the dairy business is being carried out at village level,” he added. 
As far as the market linkage of these collection points is concerned, Mr Shah said that it had developed with sale points of nearby towns. “Additionally, 40 milk sell points/outlets were opened by MPG farmers at nearby towns at their own expenses where they are selling their MPGs collected milk and milk by-products at optimum costs,” he said and added in these rural areas, the farmers were now receiving 60.6pc more cost of milk as compared to earlier (before project). 
The meeting was told that first-ever Artificial Insemination (AI) Training Centre was established under the project at Agriculture University Tandojam where 762 AI technicians were produced against the target of 760. 
It was further informed that 550 AI technicians were equipped with AI kits and liquid nitrogen gas containers to carry out AI services throughout the province. 
Besides, two Semen Production Units (SPUs), at Karachi and Rohri, have been renovated and strengthened for production of semen doses, which has reduced the need for purchase of semen doses from other provinces and import of exotic semen doses.",Pakistan

“There are 170 households of the Kolhi community settled on seven to eight acres of land in Bhave Jo Tar village. They all are landless peasants and farmers. Their fields are now owned by various coalmining companies and pasture lands are occupied by Shanghai Plant and Sino Sindh Resources Private Limited.

"Workers struggle to douse fire in Swabi mountain
","June 19, 2021","SWABI: Firefighters on Friday failed to control the fire that broke out in the famous Karamar Mountain here on Thursday as a lack of water supply and strong winds hampered their efforts.

"Ministers discuss steps to remove hurdle in vaccine procurement
","June 19, 2021","KARACHI: Just a few days after rejecting claims about shortage of Covid-19 vaccine, the federal government admitted on Friday that it was facing challenge in procurement of fresh consignments of the jabs citing “pressure to make immediate payments” from the international suppliers.   
The situation has slowed down the crucial vaccination programme across the country with Sindh alone cutting down its daily target almost by 50 per cent, according to officials and sources.  
Only on Wednesday, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Health Dr Faisal Sultan had 
 that people were unable to get their second shots on time amid severe shortage of Covid-19 vaccine and said around two million doses were available in the country. But his meeting with federal Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin along with Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Asad Umar and Minister for Economic Affairs Division (EAD) Omar Ayub told a different story.  
A statement issued after the meeting suggested immediate measures being taken by the government amid growing demand of vaccine with a decision to start the process of availing the credit lines with the country’s development partners to ensure timely payments to the vendors to maintain supply chain of the vaccines.  
“Federal Minister for Finance and Revenue, Mr Shaukat Tarin, held a special meeting with the Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Asad Umar and Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Division Omar Ayub Khan along with Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination Dr Faisal Sultan to review the COVID-19 Vaccine availability situation in the country,” the statement said.  
“Minister Planning, in his position as Chairman NCOC [National Command and Operation Centre], briefed the meeting that the NCOC forum reviews the situation on weekly basis and makes all possible efforts in collaboration with the relevant stake holders that the vaccine supply chain is not disrupted. He said that almost every country is securing its supplies in advance, which built pressure to make immediate payments.  
The finance minister, the statement said, was also briefed by Omar Ayub on the availability of credit lines with Pakistan’s development partners for vaccine procurement.  
The situation has pushed the authorities to review all possible options and finally to go for the most effective and result-oriented option.  
“The Finance Minister said that providing safety to our citizens through the timely vaccine procurement is foremost priority of the government,” the statement said. “He directed EAD [minister] to start the process of availing the credit lines with our development partners for ensuring timely payments to the vendors as no compromise will be made on the health of the Pakistanis. The Finance Minister also directed Finance Division to ensure timely disbursement of funds as per supplies schedules.”  
On the other hand, the shortage of supplies has already started showing results on grounds. Reports are emerging from the four provinces, federal capital and Gilgit-Baltistan about the slowing down of the pace of vaccination programme. The most significant impact is seen in Sindh which has been leading the programme by vaccinating more people than any other part of the country. The province, however, for the last three to four days has cut down the number of people to be vaccinated and also contained the scope of its programme by suspending inoculation at several centres and shifting focus to major urban centres.  
After touching the mark of administration of 130,000 doses in a day earlier this week, the vaccine centres across the country on Thursday inoculated only 55,728 people, including 46,113 who received their second shots. As such only 9,615 people received their first jab.   
 
The provincial administration of Sindh confirms that “there’s a crisis.”  
“We have set up about 400 vaccination centres across the province,” said Qasim Soomro, a PPP MPA and a members of the Provincial Vaccine Administration Cell headed by the Sindh health secretary. “But after this crisis emerged, we have suspended programme at several stations and are focusing more on major urban centres. We have even moved our stocks from the rural areas to the urban clusters. But through this arrangement, we can only manage for next couple of days. The federal government has assured us of restoring supplies in a day or two. Let’s see.”  
He said apart from running the vaccination progamme at 400 centres, the Sindh government was also providing the facility at several other places through special arrangements, inoculating people at their workplaces, educational institutes, trade associations, trust hospitals and major industrial units.  
“But all these programmes have been suspended after the fresh situation [shortage of vaccines],” said Mr. Soomro. “Similarly, we have prepared special 30 mobile vans which were moving to different places, including congested places like mass parking areas and remote areas of the province, to facilitate people to get vaccinated without disturbing their daily life. But that programme has also been suspended for a while.”",Pakistan
"Samina Baig, others begin journey for K2 expedition
","June 19, 2021","GILGIT: Two expedition teams including foreign climbers and renowned Pakistani mountaineer Samina Baig on Friday started their adventure to scale K2.
They started their trek to the K2 base camp from Shigar.
Talking to mediapersons in Shigar before starting the trek, Ms Baig, whose expedition has been sponsored by Special Communication Organisation (SCO), said she along with five local high altitude guides had started the expedition themed ‘K2 dream expedition 2021’.
She said they would spend two months at K2 to complete the mission, adding the objective of the summit was raising awareness about women empowerment and climate change, and provide opportunities to local climbers to scale high peaks.
Born in Gilgit-Baltistan, Samina Baig became the first Pakistani woman to climb Mount Everest (8,849), the world’s highest peak, at the age 21.
Ms Baig said K2 summit was her dream, and asked for prayers for the successful summit. 
She will be first Pakistani if she is able to climb K2.
Remembering Ali Sadpara, she said: “He [Sadpara] was one of the most amazing climbers in Pakistan and a great human being,” she recalled.
Meanwhile, another Joint Pakistan-International Broad Peak and K2 Expedition also departed for the K2 base camp from Shigar.

"Covid infections in Afghanistan getting out of control
","June 18, 2021","KABUL: The Covid-19 pandemic is spiralling out of control in Afghanistan, with cases rising 2,400 percent in the past month, hospitals filling up and medical resources quickly running out, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said on Thursday.
More than a third of tests last week came back positive, the IFRC said.
“Afghanistan is at a crisis point in the battle to contain Covid-19 as hospital beds are full to capacity in the capital Kabul and in many areas,” said Nilab Mobarez, acting President of the Afghan Red Crescent Society, in a statement released by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.
The surge was putting intense strain on a country where millions already live in poverty and health resources are scarce.
Health authorities on Thursday registered 2,313 positive cases and a record 101 deaths from Covid-19 in the last 24 hours. Officials and experts have said low testing means those official figures are probably a dramatic undercount.
Afghanistan’s fragile health system has been damaged by decades of war. Violence has risen in recent months, with US-led foreign forces withdrawing by September and peace negotiations between the Afghan government and insurgent Taliban largely stalled.
Major hospitals have closed their doors this week to new Covid-19 patients after an influx of cases left them with a lack of beds and oxygen shortages.
The IFRC warned that lack of vaccine access and hesitancy were exacerbating the situation. Less than 0.5pc of Afghans have been fully vaccinated.
Around 700,000 doses of China’s Sinopharm vaccine arrived in the country last week, allowing authorities to start the next round of its vaccination campaign.

"Balochistan Bank to be set up, says minister
","June 18, 2021","QUETTA: Finance Mini­ster Mir Zahoor Ahmed Buledi has said that the coalition government has deci­ded to establish the province’s own bank with the name of ‘Balochistan Bank’. 
The decision to open the bank will be included in the upcoming provincial budget to be presented in the Balochistan Assembly on June 18 (today). 
Speaking at a press conference along with provincial Minister for Revenue Mir Saleem Ahmed Khosa here on Wednesday, Mr Buledi said the government was making efforts to increase provincial resources to provide more funds for development of Balochistan.
“We are introducing legislation to increase our revenues,” Revenue Minister Saleem Khosa said, adding that work is under way to digitise land revenue in Quetta, Jaffarabad, Nasir­abad, Pishin and Gwadar, and after a month tax would be received through banks, instead of submission of the tax amount with Patwari. 
Giving some details of the next financial year’s budget, Finance Minister Buledi said that the size of the budget is expected to be Rs500 billion which would be more than the previous year’s budget.
He said the provincial government had managed to reduce the deficit in the previous budget by 50 per cent and bridged the gap by collecting provincial revenues of Rs30 billion while the target was Rs40bn.
The finance minister said that in the outgoing financial year, an amount of Rs108bn was allocated for the provincial Public Sector Development Programme and out of this amount Rs75bn had been spent on various development projects in the province.",Pakistan
"Angry opposition blocks roads over Balochistan budget proposals
","June 18, 2021","QUETTA: National highways passing through many cities and towns of Balochistan, including Quetta, Chagai, Washuk, Kharan and Nushki, were blocked on Thursday by supporters of opposition parties in protest against what they called the government’s act of ignoring their proposed development projects in the provincial budget scheduled to be presented on Friday (today). 
Leaders of the opposition parties in the provincial assembly announced that they would also siege the assembly building on Friday and would not allow any MPA to enter the building and present the budget for 2021-22 if their proposed development projects were not included in the provincial Annual Development Programme (ADP). 
The opposition leaders continued their sit-in outside the Balochistan As­s­embly for the last three days. “Our sit-in is round the clock,” Advo­cate Malik Sikander said. Mr Sikan­der was leading the protest against the government for not giving impor­t­ance to the opposition’s development schemes in the upcoming budget. 
Meanwhile, Maulana Abdul Wasey, provincial emir of the JUI-F and member of the National Assembly, while speaking at a press conference in the protest camp of the opposition parties asked the opposition parties’ supporters, members of civil society, traders and other people to gather outside of Balochistan Assembly on Friday to block entry of ministers and government MPAs in its building. 
He said, “We will not allow the government to present the budget which is prepared without consultation of the main opposition parties,” adding that their proposed development schemes were ignored in the coming ADP. 
Maulana Wasey asked the coalition government to postpone budget for at least five days to make it a consensus budget.  
Malik Naseer Shahwani, Prince Musa Jan, Nasarullah Zerey, Haji Nawaz Kakar, Mir Zabid Reki, Syed Azizullah Agha, Akbar Mengal, Akhtar Hussain Langove, Nawaz Baloch and other leaders were also present on the occasion. 
Meanwhile, workers of opposition parties, including Balochistan Natio­nal Party (BNP-Mengal), Pakhtun­khwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) on the call of their parties blocked Quetta-Karachi national highway at industrial town Hub, Khuzdar, Kalat and Mastung and other highways at Pishin, Qila Abdullah, Loralai, Zhob, Nushki, Sibi, Dera Murad Jamali and Dera Allah Yar. 
The Quetta-Taftan highway, Coastal Highway, Gwadar-Turbat-Pan­jgur, Zhob-Dera Ismail Khan, Loralai-Dera Ghazi Khan and other highways also remained closed for several hours causing suspension of traffic. 
All kinds of traffic, including passenger coaches, trucks carrying Afg­han transit goods and Nato supplies remained suspended for at least sev­en hours. Hundreds of trucks, coac­hes, buses and other vehicles were str­anded at various entry and exit points of Balochistan causing great difficulties to the people, including women, children and aged people tra­veling in coaches in very hot weather. 
Heavy contingents of security forces were deployed at various places on the highways by the administration of different districts to avert any untoward situation.  
Traffic was suspended on RCD Highway in Dalbandin, main highway in Basima, Quetta-Taftan highway in Nushki and Quetta-Kharan highway in Kharan by the protesters who also staged sit-ins on these highways. 
The protesters chanted slogans against the provincial government and alleged that non-elected politicians were being granted funds and the member of provincial assemblies from the opposition were being ignored just because they did not belong to the ruling party. They demanded equal funds for all districts of Balochistan.

"Japan announces easing of virus emergency ahead of Olympics
","June 18, 2021","TOKYO: Japan said on Thursday it would ease emergency coronavirus curbs in nine prefectures including Tokyo while keeping some measures, including limiting spectator numbers at big events, amid fears that next month’s Olympics could trigger a surge in infections.
Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga called on the Japanese public to watch the Olympics on TV to avoid spreading the virus, saying it was crucial to avoid any rebound in Covid-19 cases at the Games, due to start on July 23 after being postponed last year.
“The important thing is to continue with our policies with a sense of urgency to prevent the spread of infections. At the same time we must keep up our vaccination efforts to prevent the collapse of the medical system,” he told a news conference.
Earlier, Suga said authorities were lifting the state of emergency for nine areas but would maintain “quasi-emergency” measures in seven of them, including Tokyo, until July 11. The state of emergency had been set to expire on Sunday.
Under the “quasi emergency” measures, bars and restaurants, which are now barred from serving alcohol, will be allowed to do so until 7 p.m. provided they maintain Covid precautions. But local authorities can choose to keep the ban if they think it is necessary. Restaurants will still be asked to shut by 8 p.m. 
“It’s important to hold safe and secure Tokyo Games, curb the spread of infections during the period and prevent the spread of infections after the Games,” said Suga. “I would like to ask everyone to support the athletes at home, such as by watching television,” Suga said. 
Limits for the number of fans at sporting events will remain in place, and the upper limits for the Tokyo Olympics will be decided in line with these rules, Suga said, suggesting that some fans will be allowed in Olympic venues.
The current state of emergency allows only 5,000 people or 50 percent of venue capacity, whichever is smaller. And on Wednesday, the government approved an upper limit of 10,000 spectators, but only for areas not under any restrictions.
The organisers are due to decide as early as Monday on whether to allow domestic spectators at the Games and look likely to keep some restrictions on crowd numbers.",Newspaper
"Students blame Islamia University Bahawalpur for wasting two years
","June 18, 2021","RAHIM YAR KHAN: Scores of students of Khwaja Fareed Government Postgraduate College (KFGPC) on Thursday organised a protest rally against what they said incompetence of the Islamia University Bahawalpur (IUB) vice chancellor. The college was affiliated with the IUB until recent past.  
Traffic remained suspended at city’s main Deputy Commissioner Office Chowk for a few hours when the boys and girls of various disciplines of the KFGPC reached there from their college. They chanted slogans against the IUB vice chancellor who, they said, had wasted their two academic years.  
The protesters said they got admission to the KFGPC in November 2019 but the IUB held examinations in May 2020. The IUB held the examinations of its own students online and ignored them.  
The institute after one year sent the date sheet for their first semester examinations in December 2020 but again, it did not take their exams and promoted their own students in the third semester. Later, the IUB administration decided to hold their exams online but due to the negligence of its examination branch, the whole system collapsed and online papers could not be held.  
The students said the account number for giving papers sent by the IUB was not logged in which wasted their time. All these complaints were registered with the IUB administration but to no avail. As a result 90pc of the students were declared fail and dropped out by the IUB.  
Ibrahim, Usama, Kamran, Zeeshan and other students alleged that the IUB VC had grudge with the KFGPC because the college administration had IUB RYK sub campus building at Liaquat Hostel vacated two years ago. Second, they said, the KFGPC had got new affiliation with the Khwaja Fareed University of Engineering and Information Technology (KFUEIT) due to non-issuance of NOC to the college by the IUB. 
Meanwhile, District Bar Association General Secretary Mirza Muhammad Amin joined the protest in solidarity with students. Amin criticised the IUB VC whose incompetence spoiled the career of the students. The DBA, he said, would fight for these students.  
Later, Assistant Commissioner Riayasat Ali negotiated with the protesters and a three-member delegation of students met DC Dr Khuram Shahzad who assured them of solving their issues.

"Merger of two power agencies approved
","June 18, 2021","ISLAMABAD: Amid institutional disagreement over reasons behind the recent power shortfalls despite surplus capacity, the Cabinet Committee on Energy (CCoE) on Thursday once again approved the merger of two power sector agencies — Alternative Energy Development Board (AEDB) and Private Power & Infrastructure Board (PPIB).
The CCoE meeting was presided over by Minister for Planning and Development Asad Umar.
Informed sources said the reasons explained by Power Secretary Ali Reza Bhutta were challenged by Railways Minister Azam Khan Swati and National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) Chairman Tauseef H Farooqui.
The Power Division briefed the committee on the causes of electricity shortages faced in recent days. Electricity shortage and resultant load shedding was caused by a combination of factors including a drop in electricity generation at Tarbela and fuel supply disruption faced by Coal Power Plant at Sahiwal due to train accident as well as localised transmission constraints, the CCoE was informed. The Power Division said the concurrent rise in industrial sector demand and higher than usual temperatures also led to sudden shortages.
The Nepra chairman, the source said, contested the explanations and maintained that the closure of some power plants against the advice of the regulator was also a factor on top of non-availability of liquefied natural gas (LNG) when it was required the most.
The Railway minister also denied any disruption in coal transportation and said that this was an “outright misstatement”. Mr Swati said the rail track was repaired at the earliest and he personally ensured that first coach carrying coal was cleared within 24 hours of the accident.
The Secretary Power, however, did not agree to the Nepra chairman’s view. A power ministry official said the Nepra chairman was always part of the CCoE and closure of plants was decided by the committee. Also, the regulator appeared to be pushing for some projects already in the pipeline including renewable energy projects for which open bidding was required. The Power Division demanded that there should be at least a two-year cap on approval of projects including renewable projects which were not in implementation phase because about 23,000MW of projects were in various stages and would be commissioned by 2030.
The CCoE agreed to a summary submitted by Power Division proposing merger of the AEDB and PPIB and recommended its submission to the federal cabinet for formal approval. The merger was also approved about five-years ago by the then federal cabinet but the decision could not be implemented due to change of government.
The CCoE considered another summary of the Power Division proposing revision in the approved plan for closure of power plants. The committee further directed that the matter relating to assets of decommissioned power plants may be submitted to the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation.",Newspaper
"Senate body rejects many budgetary proposals
","June 18, 2021","ISLAMABAD: The Senate Standing Committee on Finance on Thursday rejected the government proposals to tax markup on Provident Fund (PF), lowering of benchmark for charging withholding tax on electricity bills and declaration of business account.
The committee, led by its chairman Senator Talha Mehmood, approved the tax machinery’s proposal to abolish tax exemption on pensions and allowances of government employees.
Continuing discussion on the Finance Bill 2021 for the third-day, committee members rejected the proposal of withholding tax on non-filers’ electricity bills exceeding Rs25,000 per month.
Similarly, the recommendation of tax on markup of more than Rs500,000 for PF was also rejected.
Senator Mehmood said the declaration of business bank account will create problems. Senator Farooq Naik said that punishment and fine should be imposed for intentional concealment of business bank. The committee did not approve this proposal of the government. The minimum fine will be Rs0.1 million and imprisonment.
The committee summoned officials of the Ministry of Industries and Production and Engineering Development Board on reduction of taxes on vehicles up to 850cc.
Senator Saleem Mandiwalla said Pakistan was a country that produced the most expensive cars and a poor man could not even think of buying a car.
“There is no mechanism for car prices here. Even today, there is no complete production of vehicles at the local level,” he said.
Senator Mohsin Aziz commented that car manufacturers have been playing with this country for 20 years.
Senator Naik and other members expressed their displeasure when representatives of various businesses approached the committee seeking tax exemptions. He said the salaried class and common people were contributing maximum taxes.
On the occasion, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) briefed the committee that exemptions on corporate sector were withdrawn in line with the recommendations of the International Monetary Fund. It was further said that the government will abolish tax on import of point-of-sale machines and these accessible to retailers for duty-free import.
Similarly, duty will be exempted on the import of card reader machine (used for credit/debit cards) and banks will be allowed duty-free imports.
The committee decided to summon the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan on the issue of medicines prices to get an assurance that reduction in duty on raw materials would result in decrease of pharmaceutical rates.
On the issue of the 2019 tax amnesty scheme and people who were unable to pay the fourth installment, Senator Naik suggested to make an amendment in the Act to provide the facility.
The committee unanimously approved proposals to reduce duties on chemicals for food processing and change the duty structure to promote Euro-V vehicles in the country.
The committee approved capital gains tax on property, tax on gifts to blood relatives and tax exemption on transfer of inherited property.
It further okayed tax rebate on turnover of Rs400 million, to investigate income and assets for non-resident Pakistanis, option of electronic appeals, to issue tax exemption to companies within 15 days, 1pc tax on export of services, to maintain 4pc super tax on banks and tax on cars’ on-money.",Newspaper
"Banks given time to develop model for housing loans
","June 18, 2021","KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan has directed banks to come up with their informal income proxy models operational for low-cost housing within four weeks as the process of lending for housing is still much below than the expectations of the government.
“In order to facilitate low-cost housing finance applicants with informal income, the State Bank has asked banks to develop and deploy income estimation model for extension of low-cost housing finance to such applicants,” said the SBP on Thursday.
Bankers were of the view that basic problem was the lease of land as they can’t extend loan for construction of houses on unleased lands. The lease itself is highly complicated and time-taking process in the country. People usually buy unleased lands and build houses since getting lease means spending time and money.
Due to lease problem banks find it impossible to extend loans which could not help out the government’s support to boost low-cost housing with subsidised loans.
As of June 15, 2021, banks have received applications of around Rs90 billion against which an amount of around Rs30bn has already been approved whereas banks are processing rest of the applications.
“Banks are required to confirm within four weeks that they have made their informal income proxy models operational,” said the SBP. The State Bank said this estimation model is expected to ease difficulties being faced by general public in availing housing finance under Government’s Markup Subsidy Scheme (G-MSS), commonly known as Mera Pakistan Mera Ghar.
Recently, the Pakistan Banks’ Association (PBA), through a consultative process, has developed and circulated among banks a baseline income estimation model. The purpose of this model is to assess income and repayment capacity on the basis of routine expenditures like house rents, utility bills and educational expenses etc of a potential borrower who earns from informal sources.
The SBP has advised banks to use PBA’s baseline model, customise the same, or develop their own income estimation model. The availability of these models is expected to greatly enhance prospects of informal income applicants to secure housing finance from the banks, it said.",Newspaper

"British Prime Minister Boris Johnson suffers embarrassing by-election defeat
","June 18, 2021","British Prime Minister Boris Johnson suffered an embarrassing defeat when his Conservative Party lost a parliamentary by-election on the outskirts of London, just a few miles from his own seat.
Since its creation in 1974, the Conservatives had comfortably held the leafy, affluent Chesham and Amersham constituency, capturing more than 50 per cent of the vote on every occasion.
However, in an astonishing turnaround, the candidate for the Liberal Democrats — a centrist, pro-European Union party — won a majority of 8,028 votes over the Conservative candidate in results announced on Friday morning.
Asked about the huge swing, junior interior minister Kit Malthouse said: ""It's tough and disappointing"".
""We would have hoped for a better result,"" he told 
.
The Conservative Party last month won a stronghold of Britain’s opposition Labour Party in Hartlepool in northeast England, which Johnson credited in part to delivering Brexit.
But some have said the approach that is attracting traditional Labour voters in northern England has also alienated some of Johnson's base in the Conservatives' own strongholds.
Johnson's parliamentary seat is just ten miles away, in West London.
""(Voters) have been taken for granted, they feel that the Conservative Party isn't listening to them. Many of them are very unhappy with Boris Johnson,"" Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said, referring to Labour and Conservative party colours.
""Everyone's talking about the red wall in the north, they should think about the blue wall in the south""
Plans to build the new High Speed 2 rail link between London and northern England which cuts through the area had provoked much local hostility in Chesham and Amersham, while government proposals to reform planning laws, which critics fear could lead to more development in southern England, had also riled locals.
The election in the Chesham and Amersham constituency was called after the death in April of Cheryl Gillan, who had represented it for Johnson’s Conservatives since 1992. At the last poll in 2019, Gillan won by a majority of 16,223 votes.",World

A series of far more violent clashes at the site in April and May helped ignite last month’s 
. The site is the third holiest in Islam and the holiest for Jews, who refer to it as the Temple Mount because it was the location of the biblical temples.
It has frequently been the scene of Israeli-Palestinian violence. This time, the police refrained from entering the compound and appeared to act with more restraint, possibly on the orders of Israel’s newly sworn-in government.
The Red Crescent emergency service said two Palestinians were wounded by rubber bullets and a third by a stone that was thrown.
Young Palestinians could be seen throwing stones at police stationed at an entrance to the compound, who fired stun grenades and rubber-coated bullets.
Hundreds demonstrated after Friday prayers in response to a rally held by Jewish ultranationalists on June 15 (Tuesday) in which dozens had chanted “Death to Arabs” and “May your village burn.” The Palestinians protested against insulting Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), after online videos showed some of the participants in the Tuesday march denigrating him.

"Tarin for providing relief to ghee, oil buyers
","June 22, 2021","ISLAMABAD: Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin on Monday directed the Ministry of Industries and Production (MoIP) to hold a meeting with ghee and edible oil manufacturers and help transmit the declining trend of international oil prices to end consumers.
The direction came from the minister at a meeting of the National Price Monitoring Committee (NPMC) while reviewing prices of essential food items. Currently, per kilogram and per litre price of branded ghee and cooking oil respectively are between Rs320 and 330, while that of unbranded category range from Rs270 and Rs320.
Mr Tarin highlighted that prices of palm oil and soybean are on declining trend in the international market but its impact on the domestic market so far has not been observed. The government will take strict action if any obstacle is observed anywhere in the country, the minister said.
Pakistan Vanaspati Manu­facturer Association statistics shows that the average monthly consumption of ghee and oils in Pakistan is around 400,000 tonnes. The production capacity of the organised sector was up to 350,000 tonnes whereas the remaining demand is filled by locally-grown oil seeds and the unorganised sector.
An official announcement said the meeting was briefed that as per international commodities’ prices comparison published by the World Bank, the international price of sugar has increased by 58.3 per cent year-on-year (YoY). Similarly, the international price of soybean oil increased to whopping 119.20pc YoY in comparison whereas increased by 23.5pc during April and May.
The Covid-19 pandemic has played havoc with the international supply-chain scenario and fueled food inflation all over the globe. Furthermore, the international price trend in palm oil indicates an increase of 102.6pc YoY and 7.9pc during the last month.
Going by the aforesaid international trend, the domestic price hike could not be avoided as Pakistan is the net importer of staple food commodities like wheat, sugar, edible oil, pulses etc. The government has taken all possible measures to provide maximum relief to the masses during pandemic-induced global food inflation crisis, the meeting was briefed.
The Ministry of National Food Security and Research gave a detailed presentation regarding the production cycle of perishable items including tomatoes, potatoes and onions. The meeting was informed that two-thirds of the pulses demand is being fulfilled through imports thus there is need to build strategic reserves to ensure smooth supply, achieve price stability and reduce international dependence.
The food ministry was directed to prepare an emergency plan for establishing cold storages and warehouses in key areas where perishable food items are produced and also explore feasible options of collaboration including the Public-Private Partnership model in this regard.
Chief Secretary Khyber Pakhtunkhwa briefed the meeting about the value-chain analysis of essential items. Mr Tarin noted that there is a huge margin of profit being earned by the wholesalers who purchased from the farmers. He directed provincial governments of Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan to present the value-chain analysis of essential items in the upcoming NPMC and corrective measures to ease out price hike.
Mr Tarin further directed working out modalities to maintain strategic reserves of sugar and wheat to ensure smooth supply at affordable prices during the upcoming financial year. He directed to initiate international procurement drive of wheat and sugar through public, private and government-to-government   arrangements.
The Utility Stores Corporation MD informed the forum that work was being done on a nati­onal plan of extending number of USC outlets. Mr Tarin directed the USC MD, in consultation with the government of Balochistan, to work out detailed plan for establishing stores acro­ss the province at spots where maxi­mum consumers may benefit by the essential items at subsidised rates.

"Multan Sultans stun Islamabad United to punch ticket to PSL 6 final
","June 22, 2021","KARACHI: Islamabad United finally hit the roadblock in the HBL Pakistan Super League 6 on Monday as the runaway leaders during the league stage as they suffered a stunning 31-run defeat in their Qualifier to Multan Sultans who punched a direct ticket for their first-ever PSL final.
The turnaround was quite unexpected given Islamabad’s red-hot form which saw them win five matches on trot to top the standings with an unprecedented eight victories. But the two-time winners of the title in 2016 and 2018 will get another opportunity to make Thursday’s decider provided they overcome either Peshawar Zalmi or holders Karachi Kings — who were playing in Eliminator 1 at the time of filing this report — in the Eliminator 2 on Tuesday.
Faced with a tough 181-run target on a sluggish pitch as the game wore on, Islamabad were never able to recover the shock of losing in-form opener Colin Munro to the second ball of the innings as the New Zealander was cleaned up by a wily Sohail Tanvir.
The former Pakistan left-armer, adjudged player-of-the-match, bowled intelligently to return excellent figures of 3-17 while varying his pace. Barring a valiant 70 (40 balls, nine fours and one six) from Usman Khawaja, Islamabad simply disintegrated in their chase and could hardly build momentum before being bowled out for 149 in 19 overs.
Apart from scalping Munro, the 36-year-old Sohail sent back Islamabad captain Shadab Khan and Khawaja. Leg-spinner Imran Tahir and giant pace bowler Blessing Muzarabani were also amongst the wickets, while ex-Test seamer Imran Khan produced a magical moment in the field when he ran out Mohammad Akhlaq on his follow through by hitting the bull’s eye at the non-striker end when Akhlaq took one risk too many.
Earlier in the evening Multan’s innings was a sort of mixed bag, and the fact they posted a competitive 180-5 was chiefly through the heroics of Khushdil Shah when all seemed lost. The left-hander, who clubbed 42 off only 22 deliveries with five sixes as his main scoring strokes, went on rampage in the penultimate over and took left-arm seamer Akif Javed to the cleaners by hoisting four consecutive sixes — two off the leading edge, the first of which landed over the third man fence — as the shell-shocked left-armer went for 29 runs, easily the most expensive over delivered by Islamabad.
Mohammad Wasim, the other youngster, redeemed himself superbly by giving just six singles in the final over being clattered for 37 from his first three overs, mainly by Johnson Charles, who teed off twice in successive overs as the ball sailed in direction of the grass bank over midwicket.
Taking into account Multan’s potent bowling resources, Mohammad Rizwan decided that batting first would offer them better chance of attacking the formidable Islamabad batting in the chase and he was eventually proven spot on. But the captain was left crestfallen when he was gone in the second over for a duck, adjudged gloving a catch down the leg side to wicket-keeper Akhlaq after umpire Ahsan Raza had turned down the appeal. Islamabad went for the DRS which nullified the original decision.
Shan Masood (25 off 22 balls, four boundaries) and Sohaib Maqsood resurrected Multan after that early reversal by putting on 53 in 29 balls when Shadab Khan struck twice in the space of three deliveries of the eighth over by trapping left-handers Shan and Rilee Rossouw to give Islamabad ascendency.
Sohaib interspersed a well-constructed 41-ball knock of 59 with powerful strikes that fetched the Pakistan discard three sixes and a touch of deft strokes, which caught the eye as the right-hander hit seven fours and helped Charles take charge during their 40-ball partnership of 62 before the West Indian was well taken inside the mid-wicket boundary by Iftikhar off Faheem Ashraf for 41 (21 balls, three sixes and three fours).
While Khushdil and Sohail provided the much-needed flourish at the death by adding a priceless 43 runs from 20 balls, Islamabad definitely erred by opting for a predominantly seam attack after leaving out Australian leg-spinner Fawad Ahmed as Shadab extracted generous spin during a tidy spell of 2-25.

"Tokyo Olympics to allow up to 10,000 fans at events
","June 22, 2021","TOKYO: Up to 10,000 domestic spectators will be allowed in Tokyo 2020 venues, Olympics organisers said on Monday, a decision that cuts against the recommendation of medical experts who said holding the event without fans was the least risky option.
The announcement ends months of speculation and highlights Japan’s determination to push on with the Games and salvage the multi-billion-dollar extravaganza amid public opposition and deep concern about a resurgence in infections.
The decision was widely expected after some recent comments by organisers and as the government’s own medical experts last week appeared resigned to the event going ahead with fans.
Japan has largely avoided the kind of explosive coronavirus outbreaks that have devastated other countries, but the vaccine roll-out was initially slow and the medical system pushed to the brink in some places. 
The limit for the Games, scheduled to begin on July 23, “will be set at 50% of venue capacity, up to a maximum of 10,000 people”, organisers said in a statement.
But the cheering — for a victory or a plucky underdog — will likely be quelled as shouting will be prohibited. Organisers also said masks would be required and spectators be requested to travel directly to venues and go straight home.
Numbers could be further reduced after July 12, depending on whether “quasi emergency” Covid-19 measures, due to expire the day before, are extended or due to any other anti-infection measures in force at the time, according to organisers.
Spectators from overseas have already been banned. The national stadium, built for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics and due to host athletics and soccer this time, would have held 68,000 fans but now will be at a sliver of that. 
Seiko Hashimoto, the president of the Tokyo Olympic organising committee, called the decision the “last piece” for the Olympics to proceed on July 23.
But as with everything about these Olympics the first postponed in the history of the Modern Games dating from 1896, though previous ones were cancelled during both World Wars the decision raised many questions.
For one, it is not quite what it seems. There will be some wiggle room on the cap, with sponsors and others dubbed “stakeholders” to attend above the 10,000 limit, according to organising committee CEO Toshiro Muto. 
Japanese media, for instance, reported that up to 20,000 people might attend the opening ceremony, over and above athletes, though Muto said he thought it would be less than that.
The decision on local fans was announced after so-called Five Party talks online with local organisers, the International Olympic Committee, the International Paralympic Committee, the Japanese government and the government of metropolitan Tokyo. A decision on the Paralympics comes on July 16.
And officials left open the possibility of a reversal if the virus rebounds. 
“If there should be major dramatic change in the infection situation, we may need to revisit this matter amongst ourselves and we may need to consider the option of having no spectators in the venues,” Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike said. 
Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has said he would not rule out holding the Olympics without spectators if the capital was under a state of emergency for Covid-19. 
“In the event a state of emergency was declared then we can’t rule out not having spectators,” he told reporters during a tour of vaccination sites in Tokyo on Monday.",Newspaper
"Crowds gather at Stonehenge for solstice despite advice
","June 22, 2021","LONDON: Dozens of people have ignored advice not to travel to Stonehenge for the annual summer solstice celebrations, which were cancelled on Monday due to coronavirus concerns.
English Heritage, which looks after the Neolithic monument, had planned a live feed of the sunrise at Stonehenge for the second year in a row. 
But the organisation said that programme had to be interrupted because of safety concerns after a number of people have chosen to disregard our request to not travel to the stones this morning.
Thousands of people who tuned in to watch the sunrise at the stones online ended up watching pre-recorded footage before the live feed returned around 5am.
Video from Britain’s 
 news agency and elsewhere showed dozens of people gathering inside the stone circle, with some scaling a low fence to climb inside the restricted area to reach the stones. Some were seen dancing and others held a banner that read Standing for Stonehenge.
English Heritage said it was disappointing to see people act in a way that put themselves, our staff and the police at risk during a pandemic.
The summer solstice typically draws tens of thousands of people to the stone circle in southern England to celebrate the longest day of the year.
Wiltshire Police said despite a minor incursion into the stone circle early on Monday, the solstice weekend was peaceful. One woman in her 50s was arrested in the area on suspicion of drunk and disorderly behavior, the force said.",Newspaper
"War of words between PPP, PTI lawmakers mars budget debate in Sindh Assembly
","June 22, 2021","KARACHI: The Sindh Assembly on Monday echoed with extremely unparliamentary words against the leadership of Pakistan Peoples Party and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf as members belonging to both parties again traded barbs during the post-budget discussion that was actually meant for forwarding suggestions and proposals by the lawmakers for their respective constituencies.
While the PPP members in their speeches vehemently condemned the PTI-led federal government for “neglecting” Sindh in the federal budget, the PTI and Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) members came down heavily on the provincial government for lack of civic and municipal facilities in the province, accusing it of ‘mistreating’ their constituencies.
The proceedings took an ugly turn when Speaker Agha Siraj Durrani turned off the microphone of GDA’s Nusrat Sehar Abbasi for continuously naming the PPP leadership in her speech.
A visibly irked speaker reminded the GDA member that it had been decided in a meeting attended by all parties that no one from the treasury and opposition would name each other’s leadership in their respective speeches.
“You have spoken for fixed 10 minutes and you are repeating the same things and I won’t allow this,” the chair snapped before muting Ms Abbasi’s mic that made the opposition members’ blood boil.
 
The members of GDA, PTI and Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan stood from their seats and gathered in front of the speaker’s rostrum for not letting the GDA member complete the speech before the GDA staged a token walkout.
Ms Abbasi was critical of Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, who also holds the finance portfolio, for presenting the budget in “English”. 
“In all other assemblies, the budgets were presented in the national language but our chief minister delivered his speech in English to woo the elements known to him,” she added.
She said that the provincial government could not achieve its tax collection targets for the past four years, adding that there was billions of rupees’ deficit in the provincial budget.
She also alleged that the provincial government was selling jobs in the Sindh Public Service Commission.
PTI’s Jamal Siddiqui said that the pre-budget session was held to seek proposals of the lawmakers for their respective constituencies, but no avail.
“We gave our proposals in the pre-budget session but none of them is incorporated in the budget,” he deplored.
He said that 50 schemes of different sectors had been pending for the past 10 years.
Like other PTI members, Mr Siddiqui also hailed the federal government for federal budget saying the country’s economy witnessed ‘growth’ even during the pandemic due to the ‘dynamic’ leadership of Prime Minister Imran Khan.
“More than Rs66 billion was disbursed amongst the needy people of Sindh under Ehsaas Programme,” he added.
PPP’s Sharmila Farooqi criticised the federal government for ‘ignoring’ Sindh in the federal budget, saying only two schemes were incorporated for the province in the central budget.
She recalled that the prime minister during his initial visits to Karachi had announced a Rs162bn package for the city but “not a single penny” was spent for the betterment of the people.
The PPP member also asked the federal government to answer where it had spent the amount received under international aid to tackle Covid-19. 
“Around Rs1.5 trillion was received from international donors for Covid-19 related relief measures and we should be given answer where the money was spent,” she added. 
The PPP MPA said that the provincial government allocated Rs1.5bn for purchase of Covid-19 vaccines.
PPP’s Faqeer Sher Mohammad, Pir Mujeeb-ul-Haq, Lal Chand Ukrani, Sadia Javed, Munawwar Wassan, Kulsoom Chandio, Raja Razzaq, Zia Abbas and Syed Sarfaraz Shah; PTI’s Adeeba Hassan, Dua Bhutto, Shahnawaz Jadoon, Rabistan Khan and Riaz Haider also participated in the post-budget discussion.
Later, the house was adjourned to Tuesday (today).",Pakistan
"Irsa warns of worsening water shortage
","June 22, 2021","LAHORE: As the national water supplies dropped by more than 50 per cent last week, the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) on Monday rang alarm bells: shortage will plummet to 30 to 35pc if the situation persists for over a week.  
According to Irsa’s data, the national river flows on Monday dropped to 223,000 cusecs from 456,000 cusecs on June 13 – a drop of over 50pc. The biggest plunge was recorded in River Indus, from 225,000 cusecs to 97,800 cusecs.  
“Irsa has started drawing additional water from both Tarbela and Mangla dams, compromising their filling prospects, but has not started passing on the shortage to the provinces,” said Irsa spokesman Khalid Idrees Rana. But it can only hold this additional supply for the next 10 days. If the situation does not improve by then, the entire country would feel the pinch.  
Against these inflows, Irsa is supplying 273,100 cusecs nationally (107,000 cusecs to Punjab, 149,000 to Sindh, 14,000 to Balochistan and 3,100 to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) without slashing the provincial share. For this purpose, it is maintaining 155,000 cusecs release from Tarbela and has increased Mangla release from 25,000 cusecs to 55,000 cusecs.  
However, it has informed Punjab that supply to the Chashma-Jhelum link canal, currently at 12,000 cusecs, would be reduced to 2,000 cusecs for the Greater Thal Canal – for drinking purposes only. It should get additional supplies from Mangla Dam for which releases were more than doubled on Monday from the lake.  
“There is an overall drop. Not only Indus, but River Kabul also dropped from 80,000 cusecs to 42,000 cusecs, Chenab from 60,000 to 34,000 cusecs during the last week and Jhelum from 78,400 to 48,400 cusecs,” laments an official of the irrigation department.  
He further said the Mangla drawdown meant that the trouble for Punjab would extend to the entire next year. “The situation is already bad at the dam because of earlier additional releases. Against a planned level of 1,208.65 feet (4.895 million acre feet [MAF]), the lake is standing at 1,153.5 feet (1.922 MAF) – a difference 55.15 feet. With additional drawdown at the end of June, when the lake should have been filled by 80pc, its level would fall by that amount – a real disaster for provincial agriculture,” he says.  
“Trouble is that Tarbela lake cannot be emptied more than four feet a day (or 155,000 cusecs) without risking its banks caving in, so naturally additional water has to come from Mangla Dam,” explains Rana. 
However, Irsa is constrained to do so, and hopes the situation improves in the next week or so.  
“On Monday, the temperature in the catchment areas dropped to 25 degree Celsius from 32 degrees last Sunday, which produced 456,000 cusecs. 
Trouble is that all meteorological predictions warn that low temperature trends will hold for next week, which means meagre flows. However, if this trend extends by even a few days beyond the current forecast, the country will be in for trouble: by July 2, Tarbela may hit dead level and national shortages range between 30 to 35pc – a nightmarish scenario for everyone,” Khalid Rana concludes.",Pakistan
"PMC vows to ensure quality medical education
","June 22, 2021","ISLAMABAD: In response to allegations by private medical and dental colleges that Pakistan Medical Commission (PMC) has been handed over to inexperienced persons, the PMC on Monday claimed that it will ensure students got quality education.
Moreover, the commission warned that any college not recognising PMC or its regulations or standards would in essence seek disaffiliation of its recognition.
On June 19, Pakistan Association of Private Medical and Dental Institutions (Pami) in a statement claimed that it will issue a whitepaper against PMC on Tuesday (today).
Pami President Dr Chaudhary Abdul Rehman demanded that the admission regulations 2021 should be suspended and irrelevant persons removed from the PMC.
He alleged that the PMC was handed over to inexperienced persons and announced a boycott of its meeting scheduled to be held on June 26. The statement claimed that the National Licensing Exam (NLE) was not acceptable to colleges and students.
NLE is an exam which every medical student has to pass before starting practice.
However, PMC on Monday showed astonishment that Pami did not bother to share its concerns with the commission.  
“Commission wishes to clarify that no direct written communication has been received from any private medical or dental college registered with PMC regarding their intent not to abide by the regulations, their refusal to undertake admissions or their refusal to accept the accreditation standards which are currently under consideration with the Academic Board, which has vice chancellors, deans, senior faculty of both public and private medical and dental colleges, HEC and CPSP as its members,” said the PMC in a statement. 
“PMC recognises individual medical and dental colleges which it has inspected and accredited and shall only be communicating with colleges individually.”  
Though PMC’s doors are always open for any of its registered and accredited colleges to share their individual views that will always be responded to as part of a standard dialogue between a regulator and its registered entities, any college which does not wish to recognise PMC or its regulations or standards would in essence seek disaffiliation of its recognition with PMC and that is the right of any private business, it added.“PMC is determined to continue its work towards improving the educational standards of medical and dental programmes in Pakistan with the singular objective of educating and licensing competent and properly qualified doctors and dentists. These steps are necessary to ensure that only the highest standards of healthcare are made available to all the citizens which are in line with global best practices. While PMC will work with existing colleges to improve their standards, if any college fails to proactively improve its standards and deliver the quality of education required, PMC will not hesitate to take necessary action,” it said.
The statement claimed that thousands of students pay millions of rupees to private colleges in consideration of receiving promised quality education and it was PMC’s responsibility to ensure these students and their right to quality education is protected and delivered.

"PPP lawmaker submits journalist protection bill
","June 22, 2021","PESHAWAR: Member of the opposition Pakistan Peoples Party Nighat Yasmin Orakzai on Monday submitted the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Protection of Journalists and Media Practitioners Bill, 2021, to the provincial assembly’s secretariat to ‘promote, protect and effectively ensure independence, impartiality, safety and freedom of expression of journalists and other media practitioners’.
Earlier, she had submitted the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child Marriage Restraint Bill, 2021.
The journalist protection bill says the government will take effective steps to ensure that the right of every journalist and media practitioner to life, safety and security as provided under Article 9 of the Constitution is safeguarded. 
Also, the government will take steps to ensure that the counter-terrorism or security laws are not utilised arbitrarily to hinder the work of journalists.
According to Section 4 of the bill, every journalist and other media practitioner shall have protection against the disclosure of professional sources of information communication and correspondence.
The bill suggests the establishment of Commission for the Protection of Journalists and Media Practitioners to look into the complaints to be filed with it in respect of acts of harassment, sexual harassment, violence and threat of violence committed against journalists or media practitioners whether by any person, groups of persons or public or private institutions or authority.
It empowers the commission to take suo moto notice of any attack on a journalist or media practitioner.
“The commission shall be deemed to be a civil court to the extent that is described in sections 175, 179, 180 and 228 of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860,” it said.

"Govt doesn’t see Nawaz, Fazl, Maryam as stakeholders in the current political setup: Fawad Chaudhry
","June 22, 2021","Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry, taking exception to the opposition’s plan to hold an ""all party conference"" on electoral reforms, said on Tuesday that the government didn’t see Nawaz Sharif, Maulana Fazlur Rehman and Maryam Nawaz as stakeholders in the current political setup.
Speaking to the media after a meeting of the federal Cabinet, the minister said the opposition leaders were making all-out attempts to derail the existing system, adding that the opposition’s decision to hold an “APC” on electoral reforms was actually aimed an weakening the parliament.
Chaudhry said, however, that the government was open to discuss the proposed electoral reforms with parliamentary leaders.
He said the 
 (EVMs) were being used in 20 countries and Estonia was the most digitised country as it had now switched to internet voting from the EVM. He added that Pakistan was looking to introduce the EVMs for transparent holding of the polls.
He also stressed that deciding a mechanism for holding elections was the job of the country's political leadership and the ECP and bureaucrats had nothing to do with it. The minister added that anyone intending to write a letter to the ECP should bear in mind that the parliament's sanctity should not be violated in its wake.
Chaudhry maintained that the election commission was not entitled to raise questions on laws passed by parliament. “The ECP has to implement all laws passed by Parliament while matters related to laws contradicting the Constitution will be dealt by the Supreme Court,” he clarified.
During the presser, the minister said that the cabinet had approved the introduction of Public Properties Removal of Encroachment Bill 2021 to pave way for reclamation of 
 encroached by certain elements.
“Under the law, an officer will be appointed by the federal government empowered to issue show-cause notice to an encroacher and, in case of an unsatisfactory answer, he can proceed to take necessary action which includes punishment and imposition of fine.”
He said that if the encroacher refused to surrender the property, then a rent will keep accruing upon him that he will have to pay later when leaving the property.
Chaudhry said an appellate tribunal will also be formed with the authority to take a decision in such cases  within 30 days. “There are federal properties which have been encroached upon and several properties of the National Press Trust have been forcefully occupied by encroachers. Similarly, Pakistan Railways and Evacuee Trust will also be able to get their lands retrieved.”
Regarding conditions imposed by some countries on 
 of certain vaccines, the minister said countries refusing to accept certain vaccines were also in negotiations with the World Health Organisation. “This is a global issue … and we expect this issue to be resolved soon,” he added.
He said the government had witnessed tendency among the public to get jabs, which was encouraging, “and this particular interest was seen especially when we opened vaccinations for all people aged above 18. Now on average, daily 0.4 million people are getting themselves vaccinated and our target is to vaccinate 70m people by the year's end,” he added.
Shedding light on other decisions taken by the cabinet, the minister said a cabinet committee had been formed to review policies related to NGOs and after examination, the committee will report back to the cabinet.
He also informed that the cabinet had approved the appointment of five independent directors in the Diamer-Bhasha Company.
The minister said a three-month extension to Asim Rauf as Chief Executive Authority of Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) had also been approved by the cabinet. “His extension is only valid until appointment of the next CEO,” he added.
""A request was earlier floated to the government regarding establishment of the Supreme Court Staff Colony. Now a cabinet committee has been formed with Shireen Mazari as its head to oversee modalities of the formation of such a colony,"" he added.
He also announced that the Cabinet had permitted Pakistanis residing in Luxembourg to hold dual nationality. “They have been permitted to hold Luxembourg nationality while being Pakistani nationals,” he added.",Pakistan
"PM orders action against FIA officials for ignoring woman’s complaints against harassment
","June 22, 2021","Expressing annoyance over reported “inaction” by the Federal Investigation Agency on a harassment complaint filed by a woman at the Pakistan Citizens’ Portal, Prime Minister Imran Khan has ordered the FIA  director-general to investigate the matter and initiate “disciplinary action” against the officials responsible for the neglect.
A letter, whose copy is available with the 
, issued by the Prime Minister House to the FIA said the woman had filed a harassment complaint on the citizens’ portal at least five times between December 2019 and June 2021, but it remained unaddressed.
The woman, after reportedly getting no response from the FIA, approached the PM House on June 15, 2021, with her husband against the FIA officials who, according to her, didn’t pay heed to her complaints, which as a result galvanized the premier into action.
The woman also left her job at a university due to the alleged harassment and lodged a complaint with the FIA, but to no avail. She also reportedly tried to commit suicide due to the lackadaisical attitude of the FIA officials in resolving her complaint.
Taking notice of the lingering yet unattended complaint, the prime minister has now ordered a “high-level” inquiry into the matter and asked the FIA to ensure retribution to the officials found responsible in the probe.
He said negligence in responding to a complaint filed by any citizen will not be tolerated.
The premier also hinted at strict action against officials turning a blind eye to complaints filed on the citizens’ portal.
The inquiry report of the case will be submitted to the prime minister on July 20, 2021.",Pakistan
"Regional efforts on to resolve Afghan issue: PM
","July 6, 2021","• Says civil war in neighbourhood can affect Pakistan’s trade link with Central Asia

• First phase of Gwadar free port zone inaugurated

• MoUs signed with China for desalination, solar energy projects

• Seven countries express interest in Balochistan’s port city 
GWADAR / QUETTA: Prime Minister Imran Khan has said that Pakistan and its neighbouring countries want peace and a political settlement in Afghanistan to avoid possible civil war, which would affect the entire region. 
Speaking at the launch of development projects and the signing of two Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) with China for different projects in Gwadar during his daylong visit to the port city on Monday, Prime Minister Khan said: “Pakistan is trying to talk to all the neighbouring countries and the Taliban to work out a political settlement with consensus.” 
“I have recently talked to the newly elected president of Iran and discussed the Afghan situation,” he said, adding that all neighbouring countries should work for a political settlement between Kabul authorities and Afghan Taliban so that Afghanistan should not fall to yet another civil war. 
While expressing concern over the emerging situation in Afghanistan along with the withdrawal of US and Nato forces, the prime minister said Pakistan was making all-out efforts for a political solution of Afghan issue.  
“Afghanistan will suffer most if civil war breaks out and neighbouring countries will also be affected apart from the Afghan refugees,” Mr Khan reiterated, pointing out that Pakistan’s trade link with Central Asia could also be affected. Pakistan made good contracts with Tajikistan and soon he would be visiting Uzbekistan, he said. “They all are interested in using Gwadar deep sea port for trade since they are landlocked,” he explained. 
About development of Balochistan, the prime minister said the future belonged to Gwadar as it would emerge as the focal point of development, ensuring prosperity of the entire country. 
It would open up new avenues of opportunities for regional trade, Mr Khan said, mentioning that Gwadar International Airport would encourage regional trade and boost economic activity and the port of Gwadar would connect directly with other countries. 
One-window operation was in progress to facilitate investment, he said, asking the Balochistan government to ensure proper servicing of investors as the subject moved to the provinces after the passage of 18th Amendment to the Constitution. 
He thanked the government of China for launching water and solar projects in Balochistan, particularly in Gwadar. One of the MoUs signed was regarding the setting up of a desalination plant with a capacity of 1.2 million gallon a day to resolve water shortage in Gwadar, while the other was related to the Chinese grant for solar generators for south Balochistan.  
Mr Khan appreciated the provision of technical education to the youth of Gwadar by China and said it would prove greatly helpful in future as foreign investment grew. “Pakistan can benefit from its strategic location and also from the expertise of its friend China,” he observed. 
According to Pakistan’s official news agency APP, seven regional countries — Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Kenya and Qatar — have expressed their commitment for cooperation on Gwadar’s development.  
The prime minister mentioned several initiatives for Gwadar uplift including establishment of a university, employment under Kamyab Jawan Programme and upgrade of equipment of local fishermen to ensure value addition of their catch. To fully protect the fishermen and improve their conditions, Rs10 billion was allocated under Kamyab Jawan programme and out of which Rs 5bn had been spent so far. 
Mr Khan vowed that PM Office would monitor on a monthly basis progress on the development plans in Gwadar. 
The prime minister said his vision of an emerging Pakistan was that of a steadfast nation committed to country’s prosperity. The government was focused on ensuring provision of basic amenities in Gwadar and Balochistan, particularly clean water and electricity to encourage industrialization. 
Terming the recently announced Rs730bn development budget for Balochistan by the federal government ‘historic’, the prime minister expressed the hope that it would mitigate the longstanding deprivation of the people of the province. “No country can progress unless it mainstreams all its areas and ensures development across the board,” he said, adding that ‘connectivity’ was one of the major components of the Balochistan package. 
Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani, federal ministers Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Asad Umar, Ali Zaidi, Fawad Chaudhry, Zubaida Jalal, Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan, Balochistan Chief Minister Jam Kamal Khan, China Pakistan Economic Corridor Authority Chairman Asim Saleem Bajwa, Chief Secretary Mathar Niaz Rana and provincial minister were present on the occasion. 
 
On the occasion, the prime minister inaugurated the first phase of Gwadar Free Port Zone besides performing the groundbreaking of its second phase spread over 2,200 acres.  
The factories inaugurated on the occasion included a chemical fertilizer factory, Gwadar animal vaccine factory and lubricant factory, besides the opening of Gwadar Tissue Plant Laboratory, adds APP.  
Also attending the programme from Shanghai through a video link were the Chinese investors who expressed commitment for investment in Gwadar and other parts of Balochistan. Those who pledged to invest in Balochistan’s different sectors included Huang Weiguo (textile), Huang Daoyuan (prefabricated technology), Fang Hongyan (agriculture), Shen Jian (wool spinning), David Dia and Chen Yi (dairy processing) and Bao Dequan (textile). 
Earlier, Gwadar Port Authority Chairman Naseer Khan Kashani briefed the ambassadors on the model of free port zone and the facilities being provided at the seaport. 
Meanwhile, the prime minister assured a gathering of elders that the federal government would enhance its contribution for the development of the Balochistan every year. 
He decried the past rulers for putting Balochistan progress on the backburner. They did not pay attention to the province and focused solely to become the prime minister of the country, he said, adding that they preferred to live in London and spent summers there. Nawaz Sharif had 24 visits to the UK out of which 23 were his private trips, he said, adding that the ex-premier did not visit Balochistan. If they had paid attention to the whole country, they might have continued as country rulers, he observed. 
Mr Khan said one who thought of Pakistan would always focus on its less developed areas first. He reiterated that the country could progress only when there was simultaneous and uniform development in all its parts. Residents of Balochistan had a sense of deprivation due to continuous neglect in the past, he added. 
Moreover, neither the Center nor the political leadership of the province, in the past, paid due attention to the plight of people, leading to widespread sense of deprivation, he said. He said his government was focusing on Gwadar uplift with string of development projects, including setting up of the desalination plant and the construction of a 300-bed teaching hospital. 
About the construction of low-cost housing units, the prime minister said, the government had received a total of 4,000 applications from the area and had identified 200 acres of land over which initially 2,500 houses would be built. He announced that Ehsaas scholarships would be given to 4,698 young people of the province. 
He made it clear there was complete ban on illegal fishing through big trawlers.

"SNGPL profit surges 69pc in 1QFY21
","July 6, 2021","LAHORE: Sui Northern Gas Company Ltd (SNGPL) on Monday announced that the profit-after-tax (PAT) for the first quarter (July-September) of FY21 jumped by 69.20 per cent to Rs3.181 billion compared to Rs1.880bn in the same period the preceding year.
The earnings per share (EPS) rose to Rs5.01 in for 1QFY21 as against Rs2.96 in the corresponding quarter of 2019-20.
A spokesman while sharing the company’s latest financial numbers said that owing to decrease in finance cost by Rs1.176bn and decrease in unaccounted-for-gas (UFG) disallowance by Rs648 million, the company despite all the economic, financial, circular debt challenges and prevailing lockdown situation due to Covid-19 has witnessed increase in profit during the first quarter of 2020-21.
Unveiling the audited report for the year 2019-20, the spokesman said due the increase in the UFG percentage and other issues had reduced profitability ratio of the SNGPL during the year.
He said the SNGPL’s PAT fell by over 15pc to Rs5.998bn (EPS Rs9.46) in FY20 from Rs7.076bn (EPS Rs11.16) in 2018-19. The company has proposed a final cash dividend of 40pc for FY20.
“The reduction in profitability is due to increase in UFG (line losses/gas theft, technical losses etc) percentage from 11.86pc to 12.32pc and accordingly increase in UFG disallowance from Rs10.528bn to Rs11.742bn. Even though UFG volumes decreased from 52.5 BCF in previous year to 48.3 BCF during 
the current year, the increase in UFG percentage is mainly due to decrease in availability of indigenous gas volumes during the year.",Newspaper
"Djokovic joined by parade of newcomers in quarters
","July 6, 2021","LONDON: Novak Djokovic marched effortlessly into his 50th Grand Slam quarter-final as Ons Jabeur became the first Tunisian player to make the last-eight at the All England Club, leading a host of first timers to reach the landmark on ‘Manic Monday’.
World number one Djokovic, chasing a sixth Wimbledon and record-equalling 20th major, eased into the last-eight at the tournament for the 12th time with a 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 win over Chile’s Cristian Garin.
He will next face Hungary’s Marton Fucsovics, one of a host of players booking last-eight spots at the tournament for the first time.
The list included women’s top seed Ashleigh Barty, second seed Aryna Sabalenka, Karolina Pliskova, Viktorija Golubic as well as Matteo Berrettini, Denis Shapovalov and Karen Khachanov in the men’s draw. 
Djokovic is halfway to a calendar Grand Slam. Only two men have swept all four majors in the same year with Rod Laver the most recent back in 1969. 
“Confidence levels are very high after winning the French Open,” said Djokovic. “It was one of my biggest wins in the circumstances — two five-setters, two four-setters in the second week. They took a lot out of me but they also gave me wings.” 
Barty reached the quarter-finals for the first time, beating French Open champion Barbora Krejcikova of the Czech Republic 7-5, 6-3. 
The 25-year-old Australian will play the winner of the match between unseeded compatriot Ajla Tomljanovic and British teenager Emma Raducanu for a place in the semi-finals. 
“It was an incredibly tough match,” said Barty. “Barbora has had an unbelievable year and am happy to come through in the end. I found some good stuff when it was important.” 
Jabeur’s historic campaign saw her reach the quarter-finals for the first time, beating Poland’s 2020 French Open champion Iga Swiatek 5-7, 6-1, 6-1.
The 26-year-old is the first Tunisian woman to reach the last eight and will face Belarus second seed Aryna Sabalenka who defeated Elena Rybakina 6-3, 4-6, 6-3.
“It was a great match and I had to stay calm rather than get angry when I failed to close out the first set as getting angry would not have helped my cause,” said Jabeur. 
Former world number one Pliskova reached her first Wimbledon quarter-final with a 6-2, 6-3 win over Russian wildcard Liudmila Samsonova. 
Viktorija Golubic, ranked 66, defeated Madison Keys 7-6 (7-3), 6-3 as she also broke through to the last eight for the first time where she’ll face Pliskova.
Karolina Muchova made Wimbledon’s quarters for the second year in a row by beating Paula Badosa 7-6 (8-6), 6-4. 
Men’s seventh seed Berrettini became only the fifth Italian man to make the last eight with a quickfire 6-4, 6-3, 6-1 win over Ilya Ivashka of Belarus.
The Queen’s Club champion, the first Italian man in the quarter-finals since 1998, will face either Felix Auger-Aliassime of Canada or German fourth seed Alexander Zverev for a semi-final spot.
Khachanov also reached a maiden quarter-final with a five-set win over Sebastian Korda who was celebrating his 21st birthday.
Russian 25th seed Khachanov triumphed over his American rival 3-6, 6-4, 6-3, 5-7, 10-8 and will face Canadian 10th seed Denis Shapovalov. 
A marathon 81-minute final set on Court 18 featured 13 breaks of serve before Khachanov steadied himself to take the victory. 
Shapovalov, who knocked out two-time champion Andy Murray in the last round, dismissed Spain’s 2019 semi-finalist and eighth seed Roberto Bautista Agut 6-1, 6-3, 7-5. 
The unseeded, 29-year-old Fucsovics became the first Hungarian to reach the Wimbledon men’s quarterfinals since 1948 by upsetting fifth seed Andrey Rublev 6-3, 4-6, 4-6, 6-0, 6-3.

"Spain, Italy take unbeaten runs into semi-final laced with history
","July 6, 2021","LONDON: Luis Enrique thought for a couple of seconds, looked straight back at the questioner, and gave the curtest of replies. 
“No,” said the Spain coach, with the blankest of looks on his face, after being asked if he had seen a better team than his at Euro 2020.  
An answer out of blind loyalty? Perhaps. 
Or was it the fact that Spain were the leading scorers at Euro 2020? Maybe.  
Or the fact that La Roja are on an unbeaten streak stretching back to October, a run of 13 games? Quite possibly.  
Spain’s opponents in the semi-finals on Tuesday might have something to say about all that.  
Italy, another of the continents traditional powers, bring an even better run of form to Wembley Stadium a national-record 32 matches unbeaten, going all the way back to September 2018.  
From the moment tenor Andrea Bocelli cleared the field at Stadio Olimpico after his stirring rendition of Nessun Dorma at the opening ceremony, making way for the start of the tournament, the Italians have been right on the money.  
Three impressive wins in the group stage, without conceding. A gutsy victory over a better-than-expected Austria in the round of 16. The elimination of top-ranked Belgium in the quarter-finals.  
Maybe Luis Enrique isnt aware, but Italy are rolling at the moment.  
This might be a match between teams who have almost forgotten what it feels like to lose. Spain have only one defeat in their last 29 games but Italy look to have the edge, at both ends of the field.  
Much has changed since Roberto Mancini took charge in May 2018, with the team having evolved into a high-energy unit that presses hard and attacks at pace. But the Azzurri’s defense needs little introduction.  
Formidable centre-backs Leonardo Bonucci and Giorgio Chiellini are still holding the fort, like they have been for more than a decade, and Italy have conceded only two goals so far.  
Spains defence, on the other hand, is a work in progress while centre-back Aymeric Laporte integrates following his switch of nationality from France.  
In attack, striker Alvaro Morata continues to frustrate for Spain and Luis Enrique has seemingly yet to settle on his preferred wingers. Italy, though, have had strong and reliable performances from striker Ciro Immobile and wide forward Lorenzo Insigne, the scorer of the decisive second goal against Belgium.  
It’s in midfield where Spain can seriously challenge Italy, potentially making it the department where the match could be won or lost. Jorginho, Nicola Barella and probably Marco Verratti for Italy versus Sergio Busquets, Pedri Gonzalez and Koke for Spain is a must-watch duel all by itself.  
This is a fixture laced with history, not least for Luis Enrique, who was left with a broken nose by opponent Mauro Tassotti which went unpunished in a 1994 World Cup quarter-final defeat and to this day sparks feelings of injustice in Spain.  
Spaniards have happier memories of their Euro 2008 quarter-final, when they prevailed on penalties after a goalless draw in their toughest game on their path to their first international trophy in 44 years.  
They met again in the Euro 2012 final in arguably Spain’s best display in that glorious four-year cycle, winning 4-0 in a performance so dominant captain Iker Casillas pleaded with the referee to blow his whistle and put Italy out of their misery.  
But the Italians would have their revenge four years later in the last 16 when a team fired up by Antonio Conte deservedly won 2-0 at the Stade de France to end Spain’s long period of continental hegemony.  
But that win did not spark the revival Italy hoped and a 3-0 defeat to Spain in qualifying for the 2018 World Cup led to them missing out on international football’s biggest event for the first time since 1958.  
It also provoked a deep identity crisis which led them to appoint Mancini.  
Mancini has got the country falling back in love with the national team by overseeing some sparkling football and creating a real sense of unity demonstrated in the way they have celebrated every victory as if they had won a trophy. 
“We are thriving on this occasion, we have made it this far and we are going to give absolutely everything in our power to make the Italian people proud of this Azzurri side,” Bonucci said on the eve of the game. 
Spain’s path to the semi-finals has been less smooth, getting off to a croaky start with dull draws against Sweden and Poland before coming to life with a 5-0 win over Slovakia and a 5-3 win against Croatia after extra time.  
Their quarter-final success over Switzerland on penalties was far less exciting but had the hallmarks of the shootout win over Italy 13 years ago and showcased the team spirit players and Luis Enrique have talked up throughout the tournament.  
A win for Spain, with the youngest squad at the tournament, sets up the prospect of a third European Championship title in four editions and potentially the start of new period of success for a nation that dominated world football from 2008-12.  
A win for Italy surely means Mancini’s team would enter the final as the favourites, no matter who wins the second semi-final match between England and Denmark.",Newspaper
"PMA calls for ‘extraordinary measures’ to ensure  SOPs’ compliance
","July 6, 2021","KARACHI: Expressing concern over the increase in coronavirus cases following significant relaxation in Covid-19 related restrictions across the country, the Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) warned on Monday that the situation could get serious if respective provincial governments didn’t take “extraordinary measures” to ensure compliance with the standard operating procedures (SOPs).
“A worrisome situation is emerging as Covid-19 cases are rising again while the general public has stopped following SOPs, wrongly believing that cases are going down. On the other hand, the government has allowed all kinds of business, commercial, academic and social activities,” said Dr Qaiser Sajjad representing PMA on Monday.
He feared that the rising Covid-19 cases might develop into a “fourth coronavirus wave” putting pressure on the fragile health infrastructure.
“We need to understand that it’s a new disease and that the virus has the ability to mutate. The country has already reported four Covid-19 variants and we don’t know the efficacy of the vaccines being used against a specific variant. The developing situation can get serious by the end of this month or beginning of August.”
Of the reported four Covid-19 variants, he pointed out, the most dangerous one was the delta variant which had played havoc in India this year. “Also, we must realize that our health system is fragile, we need to be very careful, else negligence and carelessness might cost us.”
He urged people to be cautious and ensure compliance with SOPs at public places including wearing of masks, frequent hand-washing and ensuring social distancing, especially on Eid.
“If you have got a vaccine jab, it’s your responsibility to motivate and help people around you to get vaccinated, too. If we don’t act fast, the government might have to close down everything before Eid.”
Dr Sajjad called upon the government to ensure availability of vaccine supplies at all its units and address complaints pertaining to getting a Covid-19 vaccination certificate.
It might be recalled that the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) in recent weeks has been lifting curbs on Covid-19 related restrictions after seeing an overall improvement in the Covid-19 situation in the country. This included withdrawing 50 per cent work-from-home policy and ensuring 100pc office attendance and gradually normalising inbound international air travel.
Home quarantine requirement for negative rapid antigen test cases was abolished and those who tested positive at airports were allowed to undergo quarantine at their homes instead of government facilities.
According to the NCOC website, the number of daily Covid-19 cases dropped from four digits to three digits on June 25. It remained at around 900 till June 27 and further fell to 735 on June 28.
Then, the number of cases gradually started increasing and doubled in just one week. The positivity rate was less than 2pc in June but it has now reached near 3pc.
The NCOC data showed that 29 deaths and 1,228 cases were reported in a single day and the number of active cases was 32,621 as of July 4. There were 2,126 patients admitted to hospitals across the country.",Pakistan

"KP health dept acquiring latest machine to detect Covid variants
","July 6, 2021","PESHAWAR: The health department has decided to install the latest machine to retest Covid-19 positive samples and detect Indian and other variants, which are most infective and severe than the locally prevalent virus.
A health department report said that three persons died of Covid-19 and 83 new cases were reported on Monday in the province. It said that provincial tally of deaths and cases was 4,343 and 138,616 respectively.
The report said that of the infected people, 132,683 patients (95 per cent) including 65 recorded during the last 24 hours had recovered. It said that two persons died in Peshawar and one in Abbottabad due to the virus. A total of 7,184 tests were conducted, it added.
Officials said that two persons tested positive for South African and one for Indian variant of the virus in Peshawar last month. They said that health department initiated the process to get its own machine and conduct more tests of positive patients as those viruses had also higher mortality.
The people, who had travel history to Middle East, were sent to quarantine by district administration and they were allowed to leave it when their PCR tests came negative after 14 days in Public Health Reference Laboratory (PHRL) at Khyber Medical University.
Officials said that the Pakistan-Afghanistan border could be transmitter of the Indian virus to the province as people from that country travelled to India frequently. The health department had also received recommendations from experts to close the border with Afghanistan after the Indian virus was found, they said.
They said that samples were dispatched to National Institute of Health (NIH), Islamabad from where the arrival of results was slow. NIH received samples from the whole country as part of strategy devised by National Command and Operation Centre to diagnose all infective viruses including Indian, Brazilian, UK and South African among Covid-19 patients and take measures accordingly to control their transmission. These variants have more hospitalisations.
Officials said that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had been witnessing downtrend in Covid-19 patients and mortalities for the last one month but any of those variants could prove disastrous.
Dr Asif Ali, the director of institute of pathology and diagnostic medicine at KMU, said that the process of acquiring latest equipment continued to detect the lethal variants of the virus and safeguard the people accordingly.
After a month, the machine would become operational and would start getting five samples from each of the 20 laboratories, including 13 public and seven private ones in the province, which would be analysed by medical scientists at PHRL, he said.
Dr Asif said that the machine to cost Rs20 million would be used only for detection of variants. He added that currently they sent samples on fortnightly basis but NIH was overburdened with work.
He said that the UK, US and European qualified faculty members were only involved in academic and research work before advent of Covid-19 but after the outbreak of the pandemic they started service delivery through pioneering coronavirus tests from less than 50 per day. The number of swabs processed at PHRL had reached 8,000 per day, he added.
“Our experts remain in touch with other laboratories to scale up their capacity regarding use of PCR machines, which would be used by health department in other epidemics such as dengue, etc,” said Dr Asif.
Dr Yasar Mahmood Yousafzai, director of PHRL, said that health department’s role during Covid-19 led to development of diagnostic services, which were also meant to be used in other outbreaks. “We organised training for the staff of other Covid-19 labs which has improved quality of work,” he added.",Pakistan

"Iran angry over presence of US, European politicians at opposition rally
","July 12, 2021","BERLIN: The Iranian government has expressed anger over the appearance of senior European and US politicians at a rally in support of an opposition group that has long sought to overthrow Iran’s rulers and which was once considered a terror organisation by the West.
Iran’s official 
 news agency reported that the country’s foreign ministry on Sunday summoned Slovenia’s envoy in Tehran over a video message by the EU nations prime minister at the event hosted by the National Council of Resistance of Iran.
The NRCI is the political wing of the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq, which is considered a terror organization by Iran and was once designated as such by the United States until it was delisted in 2012. The EU removed the group from its terrorism list in 2009.
Hundreds of people rallied Saturday in front of Berlins iconic Brandenburg Gate, while speakers including former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Democratic strategist Donna Brazile and numerous serving US senators from across the aisle lauded the NRCI and its aims.
Pompeo, who defended the Trump administration’s hard-line stance against Iran over its nuclear program, claimed in his video address that the Iranian government was at its most precarious state since the 1979 Islamic Revolution and called for sustained pressure on Tehran.
The former top US diplomat also compared Iran’s newly elected president, Ebrahim Raisi, to a mass murderer for his role in the execution of thousands of Iranian political prisoners in 1988.
“The United States should take the lead to hold him accountable for the crimes against humanity that he committed,” said Pompeo, adding that the US government should tell allies in Europe and Asia if they deal with Raisi,  “the United States will hold them accountable as well.
Pompeo praised the NRCI, whose funding is unclear and which has in the past paid foreign politicians to appear at its rallies, urging the group to keep up the fight.” May your mission be blessed and protected, may the Iranian people be blessed, said the Republican, who has refused to rule out running in the 2024 US presidential election.
Pompeo’s support for the group was echoed by Brazile, who praised the remarkable courage and leadership of the NRCIs president, Maryam Rajavi.
Also speaking during the event were Democratic Sens. Bob Menendez and Cory Booker, and Republican Sens. Roy Blunt and Ted Cruz, the former U.K. House of Commons Speaker John Bercow, former Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini, former Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and others.
Iran slammed Western politicians taking part in the event, with Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh accusing them of (selling) themselves cheap for a Europe-hosted circus arranged by a once Saddam-backed terrorist cult with Iranian blood on its hands.
The ministry also condemned the speech by Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jansa, calling it unacceptable, against diplomatic norms and spirit of bilateral relations, the 
 news agency reported.
Jansa, whose country holds the rotating European Council presidency, had said he backed calls for an independent investigation into Raisi’s role in the 1988 executions.
The Iranian regime must be held accountable for human rights violations and the international community must be more firm on this, he said.",Newspaper

The budget announced by Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah in the Sindh Assembly last month finally took a shape to get executed with the beginning of several new financial targets that appeared to be an uphill task for the authorities to complete them within a year. However, his Adviser on Law, Environment, Climate Change and Coastal Development, Barrister Murtaza Wahab, sounded confident saying the budget allocations were made considering all deliberations and it was his ministry that had designed the ambitious plans in view of the growing climate and environment challenges.
“Last year [2020-21] our budget was Rs145 million,” he told 
 while explaining reasons behind such a  jump in the allocations and targets set for the new fiscal. “This year we have allocated Rs1.2 billion, which is multiple times higher than it was last year. But there is a reason for this major shift. We have a lot more work to do this [financial] year. We have already finalised our climate change-related policy and considering challenges of urban infrastructure and major change in the weather trend.”
He then referred to a few projects which would get key focus of the provincial government in the current financial year and Karachi, being a major urban centre of the province, would remain under serious consideration of the authorities. He said the government was going to make three sewage treatment plants in Karachi functional to safely discharge wastewater of the city into the sea.
“These three plants, one each in Mahmoodabad, Lyari and Clifton, will greatly help reduce the load of water pollution on our marine environment,” he said about the expected outcome of the plants which were officially called TP-I, TP-II and TP-3 with a combined capacity of 150 million gallons per day. However the gradual decline in their functions finally made them non-functional, leaving more than 15 million Karachiites to discharge 100 per cent of their raw sewage into the nearest coastal waters.
The budget document suggests that the environment came at the seventh most prioritised area of the Sindh government in the budget 2021-22 after education, health, agriculture, infrastructure development, local government and irrigation.
The CM adviser said that apart from focus on the environment, the Sindh government had set half of its allocations for the coastal development. In his budget speech, the Sindh CM had announced Ten Billion Tree Tsunami Programme (TBTTP/GPP) with 50pc from the federal government and as much share by the province.
“Similarly, a water treatment plant in Tando Adam is being planned that will be a major development in the area of environment,” said Mr Wahab. “Apart from this, we have been planning Rs100 million urban foresting. I personally believe that every concerned citizen has to play his or her due part in this regard by planting a sapling for increasing the green cover at their homes, streets, and neighbourhoods. For that we are soon launching a comprehensive campaign.”
According to the budget document, the Sindh government for this year had targeted regeneration and forest development in Riverine Forests on 25,000 acres besides development of irrigated plantations on 6,500 acres. Similarly, it has planned mangrove forest that would be planted and protected over 35,000 acres. A huge target of 35 million container plants will also be developed in the network of departmental and youth nurseries for supply of plants to interested stakeholders at subsidised rates.",Pakistan
"ECP notices to MNA, others over code breach
","July 12, 2021","LAHORE: The district monitoring office of the Election Commission of Pakistan has issued notices to various candidates in the run for Punjab Assembly’s constituency PP-38, Sialkot, and some officers of various departments on violations of the code of conduct for the polls.
The ECP officer directed the Sialkot assistant commissioner to remove all the banners and panaflexes hoisted in the area pertaining to election campaigns of various candidates.
He also issued notices to PML-N MNA Armaghan Subhani for running the election campaign of his cousin Tariq Subhani and directed them both to appear before him on Tuesday (July 13) to explain their violations of the code of conduct.
On the other hand, Najamul Hassan, another candidate, has submitted a complaint against Ali Abbas, deputy secretary to the chief minister for Gujranwala division, for misusing his office to harass Mr Hassan’s voters.
The monitoring officer directed the complainant to appear before him along with the evidence against the deputy secretary.

"CDA challenges DC’s decision in built-up property review cases
","July 12, 2021","ISLAMABAD: The Capital Development Authority (CDA) has challenged the built-up property (BuP) review cases of I-12 in Islamabad High Court (IHC).
The land directorate through the law wing of the CDA filed petitions in the IHC, challenging the recent decision of the deputy commissioner Islamabad against the CDA in the review cases.
Officials said the CDA had announced the BuP award of the sector in 2009 but nine years later, in 2018, the DC CDA passed dozens of review cases making more people eligible for 51 plots.
However, the then management of the civic agency had termed the review cases a violation of the CDA ordinance and challenged them before the DC Islamabad, who is competent to hear appeals against the decisions made by the DC CDA.
The officials said in May this year the DC Islamabad decided against the CDA, saying the civic agency had not filed the review cases before his court within the stipulated time.
“We have challenged the decision of the DC Islamabad court regarding review cases of I-12
in the IHC. The IHC is yet to issue a date for hearing of the petition,” said Director Land Shafi Marwat.
“Our management is very clear. We are here to protect CDA’s rights as well as genuine rights of the citizens. In this case, we don’t agree with the reviews made by former CDA DC. That’s why we had filed an appeal before the DC Islamabad who rejected our plea only because of the matter being time-barred,” the director said.
On the other hand, the CDA officials said the worth of one plot in I-12 was around seven million rupees and in this case CDA’s 51 plots were at stake.
During the last few years, the land and security directorates unearthed a number of fraud cases, some of which were referred to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA).
The CDA DC court a few years ago announced several dubious review cases of C-15 and 1-12. In 2019, the then director land also took notice of the review cases announced by the DC CDA and issued a show-cause notice to officials who had given favourable statement before the DC CDA to help the applicants get favourable decisions.
A senior official of the CDA said a review can be made on solid grounds that too within five years after the announcement of an award.
“It is very easy even for citizens to check through Google image if a house in question existed when the BuP award was announced or not,” he said, adding CDA Chairman Amer Ali Ahmed had already ordered an inquiry against officers who did not file an appeal against the review cases on time before the DC Islamabad.
The sources said the CDA management had challenged review cases of both the sectors before the DC Islamabad who recently referred most of the cases related to C-15 back to the CDA.",Pakistan
"Karachiites full of dread as city sees first spell of monsoon rain
","July 12, 2021","The first day of the week brought a brief reprieve from the heat for Karachiites as the city woke up to the year's first spell of monsoon rainfall. However, for many it brought back painful memories of last year's disastrous rains.
: 
The rain claimed the life of a young boy in Alfalah society. SHO Rashid Din said that Hammad was riding his bicycle when he encountered rainwater that had accumulated on the street. During this, he touched an electricity pole and was electrocuted, the official said.
The unexpected rainfall became the talk of the town as 
 and 
 started trending on Twitter.
""Thank you #KarachiRain. I think we have had enough for the season already. Please take it easy now,"" said one citizen.
			
Another prayed for everyone to stay safe.
			
Federal Minister for Shipping and Maritime Affairs Ali Haider Zaidi took the opportunity to criticise the Sindh government.
""The federal government has done and is doing all it can to help the useless and corrupt provincial Sindh government, who for years failed to clean the storm drains and pick up trash. Hope we don’t drown in our own garbage once again,"" he said.
			
Data from the meteorological department showed that during the last 24 hours, Gulshan-i-Hadeed received the highest amount of rainfall (17mm), followed by PAF Faisal Base (5.0mm), University Road Met Complex (4.3mm), North Karachi (4.2mm), Landhi (4.0mm), Sadi Town (3.6mm), Jinnah Terminal (3.2mm), MOS - Old Area Airport (3.0mm), Surjani (2.8mm), PAF Masroor Base (1.0mm) and Nazimabad (1.0mm).
			
People's anxiety over the rainfall was compounded by power outages across the city. The city's power utility company, K-Electric, said it had received reports of outages from multiple parts of Karachi, adding that it was ""monitoring the situation"".
""Power supply to city remains intact. A few parts of Baldia, Surjani, Clifton and DHA are currently facing outage with Gadap being most affected. Currently supply from approximately 500 feeders remains affected whereas 1,400 feeders are operational. Supply to Dhabeji was restored on priority,"" the company said in an update shared at 8:30am.
			
Meanwhile, the rainfall also affected traffic in the city, Traffic police urged people to drive carefully, adding that officials were monitoring the situation in order to keep citizens informed. The statement added that citizens could call the 1915 helpline for queries and concerns.
In a video statement, Pakistan Meteorological Department's Karachi head Sardar Sarfaraz said that the department had earlier predicted that the monsoon season would begin from July 15.
""However, there was a chance of [rainfall] happening before that,"" he said, adding that chances of light rain and drizzle had been predicted. He said most areas had received light rain, save for a few including Gulshan-i-Hadeed.
Commenting on the weather outlook for the next 24 hours, the official said it would remain cloudy in most areas with intermittent light rainfall. He said light to moderate rainfall could be expected at night as well.
Sarfaraz said this weather system, comprising light to moderate rainfall, would prevail for the next three to four days with intermittent spells.
""As per the latest weather situation, monsoon currents of moderate intensity are penetrating lower Sindh from north Arabian Sea and under its influence intermittent light/moderate rain is likely to continue till July 16 in Karachi,"" the official added.
Sindh government spokesperson Murtaza Wahab directed the authorities concerned to ensure that water does not accumulate in low-lying areas.
""Water is being drained from busy highways,"" he said in a statement, adding that water had not accumulated around Wazir Mansion in Kharadar. Wahab said that efforts were under way to ensure citizens don't face any difficulties during the rainfall, adding that the local administration was on ground to assist citizens.
Taking to Twitter, Wahab said that the municipal and administrative staff was doing its best to clear rainwater. ""I have travelled around the city and the situation appears to be under control and traffic is also normal so far,"" he said.
			
Sindh Minister for Local Government, Housing, Town Planning and Information Syed Nasir Hussain Shah said that the Met department had not predicted any rainfall for Monday. ""Traditionally, the Met department informs the provincial government and the relevant departments,"" he lamented.
The minister also urged all local bodies across the province to mobilise resources and to ensure water is drained from low-lying areas.
Last year, record-breaking torrential rainfall had paralysed life in the metropolis and claimed more than 20 lives across the province. The monsoon spell had laid bare the poor state of Karachi's infrastructure as several areas remained submerged under rainwater for days. The flooding also damaged vehicles and property.
Angered by the lack of preparedness and response by the Defence Housing Authority (DHA) and the Cantonment Board Clifton (CBC), residents had 
 a petition in the Sindh High Court against both bodies for their ""abject failure to perform basic duties"".
In September 2020, Prime Minister Imran Khan had also 
 a ""historic"" financial package worth Rs1.1 trillion for Karachi's transformation to address the chronic municipal and infrastructure issues of the country's financial hub.
Other parts of the country, including part of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, were also left scrambling for an umbrella due to monsoon showers.
In Punjab, the highest amount of rainfall was reported by Sialkot city (193mm), followed by Sialkot cantt (107mm), Jhelum (98mm), Gujrat (66mm), Mandi Bahauddin (50mm), Gujranwala (49mm), Lahore airport (32.6mm), Sargodha city (27.6mm), Murree (21mm), Sargodha airport (20mm), Lahore city (18.4mm), Narowal (3.8mm) and Mangla (7mm).
In KP, the provincial Met department predicted mostly hot, humid and partly cloudy weather in the province over the next 24 hours.
However, rain with thunderstorm (isolated heavy rainfall) and strong gusty winds are expected in Haripur, Abbottabad, Mansehra, Battagram, Torghar, Buner, Swat, Shangla, Lower and Upper Dir, Malakand, Bajaur, Swabi, Mardan, Nowshera, Peshawar, Charsadda, Mohmand, Khyber, Kohat, Hangu, Karak, Kurram, Orakzai, Bannu, Lakki Marwat, North and South Waziristan, Tank and Dera Ismail Khan districts, the department said.
Heavy rain may generate flash flooding and may trigger landsliding in the vulnerable areas of the province, the department warned.
The highest amount of rainfall was recorded in Saidu Sharif (110mm), Malam Jabba (50mm), Balakot (39mm), Buner (33mm), Timergara (20mm), Kakul (18mm), Parachinar (8mm), Dir (6mm), Mirkhani (6mm), Besham (5mm) and Pattan (1mm).
According to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority, two children were killed while another was injured in rain-related incidents. A house was also partially damaged in Lower Dir.",Pakistan

"Delayed JCC meeting on Friday: CPEC authority chief
","July 11, 2021","ISLAMABAD: The much-awaited meeting of the Joint Coordination Committee (JCC) on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) will be held on Friday, July 16, with the aim of further expanding the scope of cooperation between the two countries and expediting its projects.  
The JCC meeting, which is being held after a gap of over one-and-a-half years, will be attended by ministers and officials of Pakistan and China through video link.  
“The much-awaited JCC meeting will open new vistas for the CPEC and expedite work on the under-construction projects,” said CPEC chairman retired Lt Gen Asim Saleem Bajwa on Saturday.  
He said the meeting would help enhance cooperation between the two countries in the fields of science and technology, agriculture, industries and the Gwadar Port. “More infrastructure-related projects will also be pledged in the JCC meeting,” he said.  
The construction of Railway Main Line-1 (ML-1) project would likely be put on fast track after the meeting as Pakistani officials would underline the need to expedite work on the project during the meeting, said Mr Bajwa.  
The construction of ML-1 project in three phases was approved by the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council in its meeting held in August last year. Initially the cost of the project was $9 billion, including equity amount from the government of Pakistan. But later on the cost was reduced to $6.8bn.  
Parliamentary Secretary for Planning, Development and Reform Kanwal Shauzab informed the National Assembly a few months ago that the total cost of the CPEC projects, including ML-1, was approximately $50bn.  
Mr Bajwa expressed the hope that the meeting would be positive and decisions on many pending road projects would likely be taken in it.  
He said decisions were taken in principle at the meetings of the JCC while the details were decided at the meetings of Joint Working Groups. “The JCC is the highest decision-making forum in the CPEC which reviews progress made on the mega project. The forum also decides on future projects,” he said.  
The last JCC meeting was held in November of 2019 when Khusro Bakhtiar was the minister for planning.  
When the JCC was formed in 2015, its meetings were held after every six months.  
Mr Bajwa said the 10th meeting of the JCC would be held via video link and it would be co-chaired by Planning Minister Asad Umar and Vice Chairman of China’s National Development and Reforms Commission Ning Jizhe.  
In response to a question, he agreed that normally the JCC meet at least once a year but its 10th meeting was being held after considerable delay because of the Covid-19 pandemic.",Pakistan
"Govt’s appeal terms Justice Isa case verdict erroneous, unjust
","July 11, 2021","ISLAMABAD: The federal government has pleaded before the Supreme Court that its 
 in the Justice Qazi Faez Isa review case should not be left in the field for being manifestly and patently unjust and against the public interest and public good which defeats the judicial accountability.  
The July 8 appeal against the May 25 decision of the SC registrar office to 
 an unheard of legal remedy — curative review petition — in the Justice Qazi Faez Isa case, also refers to the contents of the curative review petition which contends that the majority judgement of the Supreme Court is erroneous, in breach of natural justice and a result of actual bias and otherwise unlawful, unconstitutional and without jurisdiction.  
On April 26, the Supreme Court by a majority of six to four had overturned its majority ruling of June 19 last year which had ordered an investigation by the tax authorities into three foreign properties in the name of the wife and children of Justice Isa.  
Consequently, the exercise conducted by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) was rendered null and void since the fresh order, which came on a set of review petitions, recalled and set aside the June 19 verdict.  
Through the appeal, the government has requested the apex court to set aside the registrar office’s objections to the curative review petition. The appeal has been filed on behalf of President Dr Arif Alvi, the federal government through the law secretary, Prime Minister Imran Khan, Law Minister Dr Farogh Naseem, Adviser to the PM on Accountability Shahzad Akbar and legal expert of the Assets Recovery Unit Zia-ul-Mustafa Nasim.  
The appeal states that the April 26 majority judgement has sufficiently closed the doors of the judicial accountability in general and the accountability of Justice Isa in respect of the allegations and information which has come on record besides it is also against the principles of judicial independence and the fundamental rights of the “judged” by the people at large with regard to access to justice and the right to life.  
The majority judgement has also diluted the standards of judicial accountability rather a shield has been provided to the judges of the superior courts to hide behind the doctrine of judicial independence only to evade judicial accountability, the appeal argues.  
The concept of judicial independence is not primarily meant for the benefit of individual judges but the doctrine of judicial independence is meant for the benefit of the judged and for securing the interests, rights and benefits of the entire society, it says.  
The majority judgement is also against the Islamic and modern jurisprudence and also against the high ethical and moral principles envisaged in the Code of Conduct for judges of the superior courts, the appeal says.  
The majority judgement also fails to emphasize that the duty of the officials, judges, Qazis and public servants to explain their finances and assets owes its genesis to our religion and glorious heritage, apart from being fully backed by modern jurisprudence and that the assets and finances of close relatives of public servants, officials, judges, Qazis etc. such as their spouses and dependent children are also required to be explained, the appeal emphasises.  
The majority judgement has exempted a judge’s wife, whether independent or not, and his dependent children from scrutiny of their assets and finances, the appeal argues, adding that it has also granted exemption to judges of the superior courts, particularly Justice Isa, from explaining the foreign assets in the names of his wife and children, who have not been able to give any justification with regard to the sources from which three London properties were acquired, it contends.  
The appeal alleges that Justice Isa was sufficiently connected with the foreign currency bank account of his wife through which the London properties were funded.  
The appeal also questions the SC registrar office’s objection that scandalous language was used in the curative review petition, saying no such language was used.",Pakistan
"Basic health services planned for people in Charsadda, Kohat
","July 11, 2021","PESHAWAR: The health department has decided to implement the Essential Package of Health Services (EPHS) in Charsadda and Kohat districts to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC) target set out in the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.
“The draft EPHS for UHC Universal Health Coverage has been finalised and will soon be placed before the steering committee headed by the health minister for approval to implement it in Charsadda and Kohat. It is a policy framework for service provision based on the scientific evidence of health interventions and will ensure that all people have access to essential health services particularly in the context of limited resources,” an official told 
.
According to officials, the health department in partnership with the Ministry of National Health Services and Regulations (NHSR) and development partners prioritised health interventions at community, primary healthcare, first level hospital, tertiary care and population levels for inclusion in the KP EPHS.
They said a total of 132 interventions (immediate level) at all five platforms had been included in the package with the annual unit cost of $29 per person.
The National Health Accounts, 2017-18, showed that the provincial government was spending $17 per capita on healthcare.
The officials said the national health services ministry began work on the development of the Essential Package of Health Services for UHC at national level in July 2019.
They said the Essential Package of Health Services was endorsed by the Inter-Ministerial Health and Population Council on Oct 22, 2020.
The officials said the UHC reforms were meant to improve universal access to affordable, quality essential health services, delivered through a resilient and responsive health system leading to an increase in the UHC Index from a baseline of 40 per cent in 2015 to more than 65 per cent by 2030.
“Once approved, the EPHS will be implemented in two districts in the first phase and will be extended to six more districts in the next phase. The package’s implementation will be funded through the World Bank after approval by the National Health Support Programme. Under this programme, support will be provided to the health department through the recurrent budget and health system under the disbursement linked indicators (DLIs) mechanism,” an official said.
He said a three-stage approach had been used for the province to localise the package.
According to officials, Stage I includes governance arrangement for localisation and technical and steering committees with composition and terms of reference have been formed for it, while Stage II is about sensitisation and situation analysis regarding the availability of benefit package interventions for UHC. Stage III is meant for the actual provincial localisation exercise.
They said in 2015, ensuring UHC became the foundation for SDGs to alleviate poverty and inequality by 2030, while healthcare had a central place in SDG 3, which was about ensuring healthy lives and promoting the well being of the people at all ages.
The officials said the EPHS defined services for every level of health facilities, including community, basic health units, rural health centre and secondary level hospitals.
They said every province had developed own health services package in light of the respective disease burden to reduce its quantum through universal health services.",Pakistan
"Call for overhauling entire education, examination system
","July 11, 2021","KARACHI: The Sindh government is denying children their fundamental right to education guaranteed in the Constitution by failing to provide quality education and that includes the responsibility to ensure holding exams in a fair and transparent manner. Rampant malpractices in the exam system and lack of action against corrupt officials suggest that there is no state willingness to bring improvement.
These points were raised by experts sharing their views with Dawn in the light of reports about the matriculation board exams marred by paper leaks and rampant cheating.
“Education doesn’t mean getting a professional degree or job alone. It’s a tool that helps a child realise his or her full potential in life and become a productive member of society. A defective examination system, among other factors, is a barrier to this agenda,” said Iqbal Ahmed Detho, member-Sindh of the National Commission on the Rights of Child.
The commission was established last year under the National Commission on the Rights of Child Act, 2017, with an aim to monitor situations and developments on child rights in the country and safeguard children from abuse, exploitation, violence and neglect.
 
The right to free and compulsory education, he recalled, was not a fundamental right under the Constitution till 18th Amendment was passed in 2010 by the National Assembly. 
“Before that, it fell in the category of Principle of Policy, which means that the state would fulfil its responsibility till it gets the resources. After 18th Amendment, people can seek court’s intervention, if they feel that the state is failing to provide quality education,” he said.
The fundamental right to education, he pointed out, had several dimensions and included the right to access a school and afford quality education. 
“Also, the right to an education which is culturally and religiously appropriate. To get to this level, the state has to establish a fair and transparent examination system and not doing so means the very aim of education is defeated,” he added.
Mr Detho also referred to the Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), which Pakistan ratified in 1990, as well various provincial laws including the Sindh Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act 2013 and Sindh School Education Standards and Curriculum Act 2015, regretting lack of implementation of the legal framework available to the government.
“Of the 22.8 million out-of-school children in the country, most are in Sindh and Balochistan. The Sindh government is yet to establish a seven-member council required to oversee the state of education under the 2013 Act,” he noted.
In his remarks, Prof Yaqub Chandio, a senior teacher who represented the Sindh Professors and Lecturers Association (SPLA) several times and currently is an elected member of the Sindh University’s Senate, criticised the government for its failure in taking action against officials found guilty in multiple inquiries.
“One of the reasons for the rotten school/college education systems is that chairmen of boards and vice chancellors of universities never get retired. They are appointed to another key post if charges were proven against them in one particular inquiry,” he said, citing various cases in which officials with tainted records were transferred to other educational institutions.
He was of the opinion that the government wanted to intentionally destroy and disable the system to justify its privatisation. 
“They are so many ways to check flaws and improve the system but the government doesn’t seem interested. Last but not least the government should make educationists secretary and minister of education rather than bureaucrats. Currently, the steering committee on education has no teacher or parent representation,” he said.
Karachi University’s dean, faculty of education, Prof Nasir Sulman called for overhauling the entire education and examination system. 
“The system should be concept-oriented, which will also minimise chances of cheating. Preparation of examination papers is a science which requires teachers’ training. If countries poorer than us can improve their education system, why can’t we?” he asked.",Pakistan
"Bangladesh factory owner held after fire kills 52
","July 11, 2021","DHAKA: The owner of a factory where 52 people died in a fire was arrested for murder on Saturday as it emerged that children as young as 11 had been working there.
Police said Abul Hashem and four of his sons were among eight people detained over the inferno, which broke out Thursday and raged for more than a day.
A separate inquiry has been launched into the use of child labour at the food factory.
Jayedul Alam, police chief for Narayanganj district where the factory is located, said the entrance had been padlocked along with multiple other breaches of safety regulations.
“It was a deliberate murder,” the police chief said.
Before his arrest, Hashem told the 
 newspaper the fire  “may have been a result of workers’ carelessness” and a discarded cigarette could have sparked the carnage.
Emergency services found 48 bodies on the third floor of the Hashem Food and Beverage factory in Rupganj, an industrial town outside Dhaka.
The fire department said the exit door to the main staircase had been padlocked and highly flammable chemicals and plastics had been stored in the building.
Monnujan Sufian, state minister for labour, said inquiries had begun into the use of child workers at the factory.
Laizu Begum, who spent hours waiting outside the factory for news of her 11-year-old nephew, said he had been working on the third floor.
“We heard the door of the floor where my nephew worked was padlocked. Then we realised after seeing how big the fire was that he is probably dead,” said the woman.
Outside the burned shell of the factory and at the hospital morgue, this news agency spoke to 30 survivors and relatives of the dead, who said child workers at the factory were paid just 20 taka (24 US cents) per hour.
Bilal Hossain, whose 14-year-old daughter was among the missing, went to the Dhaka Medical College Hospital morgue with a photo, begging police and doctors to find her remains.
“I sent my baby girl to die,” said Hossain, who added that the company owed the girl back wages.  “How will I tell her mother?” Chandu Mia held a photo of his 15-year-old daughter.  “I am not sure if she is alive,” he said, holding back tears. State minister Sufian said she had spoken to two survivors aged 14.
“I went to the hospital and I asked them how old they are. The youngest were 14,” she said.
Sufian said some children of 14 were allowed to work in non-hazardous jobs, but that the Hashem factory was considered hazardous.
“If child labour is proved, we will take action against the owner and the inspectors,” she said.
Bangladesh pledged safety reforms after the Rana Plaza disaster in 2013, when a nine-storey complex collapsed killing more than 1,100 people.
But there has been a series of fires and other disasters since then. At least 70 people died in February 2019 when fire tore through Dhaka apartments where chemicals were illegally stored.
Unions have said the latest disaster has again showed how labour and factory laws are poorly enforced.
The International Labour Organisation, a UN agency, said the blaze  “illustrates the urgent need” for Bangladesh authorities and building owners to ensure that factories meet national safety standards.
The ILO said the government must  “apply renewed vigour in addressing the safety deficits in workplaces across the country”.",Newspaper

Protests erupted this week in parts of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), Zuma’s home province, after the ex-leader handed himself over to police to serve a 15-month jail term for contempt of court.
On Friday, the high court dismissed Zuma’s application to have his arrest overturned in a case that has been seen as a test of the post-apartheid nation’s rule of law. An hour before the ruling, a photographer saw a group of protesters shouting  “Zuma!” burning tyres and blocking a road.
Zuma’s imprisonment has laid bare deep divisions in the governing African National Congress (ANC), as a party faction remains loyal to the former president and has been a potent source of opposition to his successor, Cyril Ramaphosa.
KZN police spokesman Jay Naicker said the 28 arrests had happened since Friday on charges including public violence, burglary, malicious damage to property, and contravention of COVID-19 lockdown regulations.
He said protesters had set alight some trucks near Mooi River, a town on the N3 highway that leads from Durban to Johannesburg, and shops had been looted in Mooi River and eThekwini, the municipality that includes Durban.
Law enforcement officers had been deployed to all districts in the province but there had been no deaths or injuries so far, he added. As of lunchtime, the N3 was closed at Mooi River.
Ramaphosa, whose allies engineered Zuma’s ouster in 2018, said in a statement that  “criminal elements must be met with the full might of the law”.
Asked about the protests by public broadcaster SABC, a spokesman for Zuma’s charitable foundation said:  “The righteous anger of the people is because of the injustices that they see being dispensed to President Zuma”.
Zuma was given the jail term for defying an order from the constitutional court to give evidence at an inquiry investigating high-level corruption during his nine years in power.
He denies there was widespread corruption under his leadership but has refused to cooperate with the inquiry that was set up in his final weeks in office.
Zuma has challenged his sentence in the constitutional court, partly on the grounds of his alleged frail health and the risk of catching Covid-19. That challenge will be heard on Monday.
KZN Premier Sihle Zikalala said in a video message the provincial government understood the  “extreme anger” of those protesting.
“We find ourselves in a ... unique situation wherein we are dealing with the arrest of the former president,” he said.  “Unfortunately violence and destruction often attack and affect even people who are not involved.”",Newspaper
"Opposition rises from within to Ashfaq-led PFF’s plan of holding franchise league
","July 11, 2021","KARACHI: Ashfaq Hussain Shah says he’s keeping his word. Sardar Naveed Haider Khan says the plan to give rights to a company to hold the Pakistan Football League is a ‘15-year sellout’. 
The court-elected Pakistan Football Federation president Ashfaq and his vice-president Naveed, who are not recognised by FIFA and whose takeover of the PFF headquarters in March saw Pakistan suspended by the global football body, seem to be at loggerheads regarding the latest plan for a franchise football league in the country. 
“I cannot be part of such a sellout,” Naveed told 
 on Saturday. “I will oppose the holding of this. There are serious concerns with this project.” 
Ashfaq, meanwhile, said he was only sealing a deal that was supposed to be completed back in 2019. 
Then, months after coming into power following an election held by the Supreme Court in December 2018, Ashfaq was about to enter an agreement with UK-based TouchSky Global to sponsor and market Pakistan’s domestic football tournaments which would in turn see the PFF partnering with them for a franchise league. 
That agreement never came to fruition as Ashfaq handed over the PFF headquarters to the PFF Normalisation Committee, appointed by FIFA in September 2019 to hold fresh elections of the country’s football governing body. TouchSky tried to hold talks with the PFF NC to seal the deal but were rebuffed. 
Two years on, Ashfaq is back, having taken over the PFF headquarters from the NC, citing a failure of the FIFA-appointed committee to hold elections in 18 months since it took over. TouchSky is no more but the company behind the PFL plan is Global Soccer Ventures Pvt Limited.  
Same people, different name? “I’ve been in talks with the group for several years,” added Ashfaq. “They were willing to spend money on Pakistan football then, they’re willing to spend money now.” 
Global Soccer Ventures was incorporated on March 29 this year, just two days after Ashfaq’s group of officials took over the PFF headquarters, and is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan. 
Its CEO is former K-Electric sports manager Zabe Khan, who has worked with TouchSky on football projects in the past.  
“It’s the same group but it’s now led by Zabe,” Ashfaq informed. “My aim for long was to hold a football league on similar lines to cricket’s Pakistan Super League and now we’re about to do it. 
“The PFL plan was given during our emergency committee meeting as well as the executive committee meeting, where we were all in agreement to hold this,” said Ashfaq, when asked about Naveed’s resentment. “We’re entering a 15-year deal but there will be an assessment after five years.” 
The model proposed by Global Soccer Ventures seems to be similar to the one in neighbouring India, where IMG-Reliance secured all commercial rights to tournaments organised by the All Indian Football Federation for 15 years in 2010 and oversaw to the launch of the Indian Super League four years later. 
The ISL has since taken over the I-League as India’s top league competition. 
 has learnt that the PFL will have six teams with PFF being offered Rs4,000,000 for each franchise, which will be sold by Global Soccer Ventures for US$2milllion. All commercial rights, including broadcasting and sponsorship, will be with Global Soccer Ventures with PFF receiving 12.5 per cent from the total revenue. 
“We’re underselling rights for Pakistan football,” said Naveed. “Also we haven’t even seen whether the company has the financials to back what they’re promising.” 
Ashfaq argued that the Pakistan Premier Football League will continue to be played with the PFL giving players an opportunity to play an international standard event. “It’s in the best interests of Pakistan football. This will help boost Pakistan football.” 
Over the last several years, the idea of holding a franchise league has been floated numerous times by different parties in Pakistan. PSL franchise Peshawar Zalmi owner Javed Afridi and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa football official Shahid Shinwari have all stated their intentions of doing so. 
Afridi, it has been reliably learnt, is aligned with Global Soccer Ventures in the PFL plan. 
However, it remains to be seen what standing the agreement between Ashfaq’s PFF and Global Sports Ventures will have considering the former isn’t recognised by FIFA. 
Interestingly, Haroon Malik — the PFF NC chief appointed by FIFA in January this year following the resignation of previous chairman Humza Khan — has designs on holding a football league himself.  
Z2C Limited, the company where Haroon is an executive director, has a sports monetization unit which “aims at managing and creating sports leagues for games that are played in Pakistan”. And football has long been on its agenda.",Newspaper
"Messi ends trophy drought as Argentina beat Brazil to win Copa America
","July 11, 2021","Superstar Lionel Messi won his first trophy with his national team as Angel Di Maria's goal gave Argentina a 1-0 win over hosts Brazil in the Copa America final on Saturday.
The victory at Rio de Janeiro's Maracana stadium ended Argentina's 28-year wait for a major trophy, and also ended Brazil's unbeaten home record that stretched back more than 2,500 days.
Argentina had last tasted success at a major tournament in 1993 when the great Gabriel Batistuta's brace gave them a 2-1 win over Mexico in the Copa final in Ecuador.
“It's a great title, especially for our people. The fans support the team unconditionally. I think they can identify with this team that never gives in,” said Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni.
It was the first time in six editions playing at home that Brazil had failed to lift the trophy.
And while 34-year-old Messi's odyssey has come to an end, Brazil's Neymar, five years his junior, is still without a major title at international level having missed the Selecao's win on home soil two years ago through injury.
Argentina edged a brutal and fractious affair thanks to Di Maria's goal on 22 minutes.
The 33-year-old winger ran onto Rodrigo De Paul's sumptuous through ball to lob Brazil goalkeeper Ederson with a first time finish.
“We fell short so many times, we dreamt so much about this, fought so hard,” said Di Maria, who was named man of the match.
“Many people said we wouldn't manage it, we were criticised a lot. But we kept knocking at the door and kept going until today we knocked it down and entered.” 
Messi could have wrapped up the win two minutes from time but slipped when clean through with only Ederson to beat.
“We have to be big enough to recognise (the defeat) regardless of how painful and difficult it is,” said Brazil coach Tite.
In a frantic start, Argentina's burly enforcer Nicolas Otamendi was quickly in with his first foul while Brazilian midfielder Fred picked up the first booking after just three minutes for a studs up lunge at Gonzalo Montiel.
Brazil were unchanged from their semi-final win over Peru while Scaloni made five alterations, notably bringing in Di Maria — who made an energetic and decisive entry off the bench against Colombia last time out.
			
The final was the first match of the tournament, which was originally due to take place last year, to allow in fans as 7,800 — a tenth of the Maracana capacity — took their seats after authorities partially lifted pandemic restrictions.
The first clear chance came on 13 minutes as Richarlison headed down Marquinhos's long ball into the path of Neymar but the Brazilian star was crowded out by a pair of defenders.
The brutal nature of the early challenges could be seen on the players' kits, with Neymar sporting ripped shorts and Lucas Paqueta being left with a hole in his sock following an intervention by Otamendi.
Argentina played with aggression and commitment, but no lack of quality with Di Maria tormenting Brazil's left back Renan Lodi, who probably should have cut out De Paul's pass for the winger's goal.
Di Maria had a shot from 20 yards blocked while Messi fired just wide following a 40 yard run.
Brazil struggled to create anything of note and even when they had a free-kick from shooting range, Neymar couldn't beat the wall.
When the hosts did finally maintain some pressure late in the first half, Everton's deflected strike bobbled though to goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez.
Tite was quick to act, bringing on forward Roberto Firmino for defensive midfielder Fred at half-time.
Richarlison had the ball in the net soon after but he was flagged offside.
And moments later Neymar teed up Richarlison but Martinez parried his near post effort.
Increasingly it descended into a fractious, niggly affair with little fluid play between fouls and a plethora of theatrics and petulant bickering.
It was playing into Argentina's hands as they looked to run down the clock and hold onto their slender lead.
“Only one team wanted to play. It's a trap we knew about. That's not an excuse,” complained Brazil captain Thiago Silva. “It's difficult to play such a stop-start match.” 
Brazil managed to up the pressure again at the end of the half but they lacked a killer touch against some full-blooded defending — Montiel even finished the game with his white sock soaked in blood.
When Brazil substitute Gabriel Barbosa fired a volley on target, Martinez was equal to it.
Messi slipped embarrassingly late on with a chance to clinch victory but it mattered little as moments later his teammates were tossing him in the air to celebrate their win.",Sport
"'Experience of a lifetime': Billionaire Richard Branson achieves space dream
","July 11, 2021","British billionaire Richard Branson flew into space on Sunday aboard a Virgin Galactic vessel, a voyage he described as the “experience of a lifetime” — and one he hopes will usher in an era of lucrative space tourism.
“Congratulations to all our wonderful team at Virgin Galactic for 17 years of hard, hard work to get us this far,” he said during a live feed as the VSS Unity spaceship glided back to Spaceport America in New Mexico.
It reached a peak altitude of around 53 miles (85 kilometres) — beyond the boundary of space, according to the United States — allowing the passengers to experience weightlessness and admire the Earth's curvature.
The trip proceeded without drama, and touchdown occurred at around 9:40am Mountain Time (1540 GMT), about an hour after take-off.
			
The mission's success means Branson has beaten fellow billionaire Jeff Bezos in the race to be the first tycoon to cross the final frontier in a ship built by a company he founded.
			
Earlier, a massive carrier plane took off and ascended to 50,000 feet before dropping VSS Unity to complete the rest of the flight using its rocket-powered engine.
The spaceplane carried two pilots and four passengers, including Branson.
The ship then re-entered the atmosphere, lowered its flexible wings and glided back to the runway.
A smiling Branson hugged loved ones after the trip.
Several tourists journeyed to the International Space Station in the 2000s, but on Russian rockets.
			
Branson's official role is to evaluate the private astronaut experience to enhance the journey for future clients.
Branson, who founded the Virgin Group that today has interests in everything from commercial aviation to fitness centres, is known for his appetite for adventure and has set world records in hot air ballooning and boating.
“As a child, I wanted to go to space,” the 70-year-old wrote a few days ahead of his trip.
He founded Virgin Galactic in 2004, but the dream almost came to an end in 2014 when an in-flight accident caused the death of a pilot, considerably delaying the program.
			
Since then, VSS Unity has successfully reached space three times, in 2018, 2019 — which included the first crew member who wasn't a pilot — and finally May this year.
Sunday's spaceflight took off from Spaceport America, a huge base built in the Jornada del Muerto desert, around 20 miles southeast of the nearest dwelling, Truth or Consequences.
Financed largely by the state of New Mexico, Virgin Galactic is the principal tenant.
After Sunday, Virgin Galactic plans two further flights, then the start of regular commercial operations from early 2022. The ultimate goal is to conduct 400 flights per year.
Some 600 tickets have already been sold to people from 60 different countries — including Hollywood celebrities — for prices ranging from $200,000 to $250,000.
And though, according to Branson, “space belongs to us all,” the opportunity for now remains the preserve of the privileged.
“When we return, I will announce something very exciting to give more people the chance to become an astronaut,” he promised.
			
The competition in the space tourism sector, whose imminent rise has been announced for years, has come to a head this month.
Bezos, the richest person in the world, is due to fly on July 20 on Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket.
Blue Origin posted an infographic Friday boasting the ways in which the experience it offers is superior.
The principal point: New Shepard climbs up to more than 60 miles in altitude, thus exceeding what is called the Karman line, the frontier of space according to international convention.
Bezos himself wished Branson “best of luck” in an Instagram post the following day.",World
"Govt won’t defend controversial clauses of poll reform bill: minister
","July 13, 2021","ISLAMABAD: The government on Monday showed its readiness to withdraw some of the clauses of the Elections (Amendment) Bill 2021 on which the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and the opposition parties had raised serious objections as Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Ali Muhammad Khan told a Senate body that the government would not defend and pursue anything unconstitutional in the proposed law.
“The minister has given us an undertaking that the government will not pursue anything which is against the constitution,” said Taj Haider, chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Parliamentary Affairs, after presiding over the committee’s meeting which reviewed the proposed bill which has already been passed by the National Assembly.
The official handout issued by the Senate Secretariat after the meeting quoted the minister to have stated: “We would not make any amendment to the bill that is unconstitutional.”
The minister said the bill had been drafted by Law Minister Farogh Naseem and former parliamentary affairs minister Azam Khan Swati.
Talking to 
, Mr Haider said they had started clause-by-clause discussion on the bill and the committee could only take up 25 per cent agenda. He said the committee members sought input on each clause from the minister and the secretary for the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs.
Responding to a question, Mr Haider said he intentionally did not raise the controversy regarding the Senate chairman’s act of cancelling the briefing of the representatives of the civil society, including Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen), as he had already written a letter to Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani protesting over this act.
Mr Haider, however, said that he had called an informal meeting with the Fafen representatives before start of the committee’s meeting. The meeting was attended only by Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Senator Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar.
Responding to a question, Mr Haider said he had invited all the members of the committee to the informal meeting, but perhaps they could not attend it because the meeting was held on a very short notice. He termed the Fafen briefing “very useful”.
Mr Haider said some of the members suggested him to wait for the outcome of the report of the committee constituted by the speaker to review the bills, including the two bills regarding the election laws, passed by the government in haste on June 8, but he refused.
Meanwhile, sources told 
 that during the meeting, the secretary of parliamentary affairs ministry faced a tough time from the members, especially from PPP’s Farooq Naek. Mr Naek criticised the government’s move to hand over the responsibility of voters’ registration to Nadra, instead of the ECP, terming it an unconstitutional act.",Pakistan
"Tarin orders procurement of 100,000 tonnes of sugar to build reserves
","July 13, 2021","ISLAMABAD: The National Price Monitoring Committee has express­­ed satisfaction over the recent declining trend in sugar price. 
Presiding over a meeting of the committee here on Monday, Minister for Finance and Revenue Shaukat Tarin ordered procurement of 100,000 tonnes of sugar to ensure strategic reserves of the sweetener. 
The finance secretary briefed the meeting about a slight increase of 0.07 per cent in the weekly Sensitive Price Index (SPI) indicating price stability as compared to previous weeks.  
The committee noted that year-on-year weekly inflation was coming down for the past two months from a high of 17.23pc on May 20, 2021 to 12.28pc on July 8, which is a significant decline in SPI. 
Similarly, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) released on July 1 showed an annual inflation at national level at 8.9pc which was down from 10.74pc a year ago. Urban and rural inflation stood at 8.15pc and 10.05pc as compared to 10.17pc and 11.63pc, respectively. “Clearly, the inflation is coming down across all measures,” an official statement said. 
While reviewing the year-on-year and week-on-week inflation trends, the finance minister asked the respective district administrations and departments to take stern measures to keep the prices of essential items, including vegetables, in check on Eidul Azha to eliminate profiteering. 
Mr Tarin constituted a working group under the NPMC comprising provincial chief secretaries, secretary finance division and representatives of the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), Ministry of National Food Security and Research and other relevant departments to work out measures for bringing price stability in basic commodities by using mystery shopping exercise and building strategic reserves of wheat, sugar, pulses, ghee, tomatoes, onions and potatoes to eliminate undue profit margins and ensure availability of these items at affordable prices. 
The finance minister directed the PBS to present a detailed variance analysis vis-a-vis weekly SPI highlighting food prices prevailing across mainstream cities and districts for real-time comparison. The data would be used by the respective provincial administrations and departments to ensure that notified rates are being followed across the board and help minimise price differential between farm gate and retail rates. 
The Ministry of Industries and Production secretary told the committee that after increase in prices of soya bean and palm oils, the international prices have registered a decline. 
Mr Tarin directed the Ministry of Industries and Production, the Competition Commission of Pakistan(CCP) and the Federal Board of Revenue to take requisite actions to ensure that current decline in the international prices of edible oil was passed on to the domestic consumers soon. 
The CCP chairperson said the commission had already undertaken an inquiry in the edible oil and ghee sector to ascertain information and crosscheck facts regarding alleged collective fixing of retail prices of various products of cooking oil and ghee for different market segments.",Newspaper
"Southgate says ‘too soon’ to decide on contract
","July 13, 2021","LONDON: England manager Gareth Southgate says he will pause before any decision over his future but that he currently intends to stay in charge of the team.
England lost the Euro 2020 final to Italy on penalties on Sunday after the game ended 1-1 after extra time.
Southgate is under contract until after next year’s World Cup in Qatar but the Football Assoc­iation had already expressed an intent to extend his deal. 
“I don’t think now is an appropriate time to be thinking about it. We have to qualify for Qatar. I need time to go away and reflect on Euro 2020. I need a rest,” Southgate told a news conference on Monday. 
“To lead your country in these tournaments takes its toll. I don’t want to commit to anything longer than I should. It’s not a financial thing. As I sit here today. I would be wanting to take the team to Qatar,” he added. 
The England manager, who led the team to the last four in the World Cup in Russia in 2018 said that a number of successful national teams had suffered the pain of being close to title before finally breaking through. 
“If you want sustained success as a team, you need to be constantly evolving, improving and constantly finishing in latter stages of tournaments,” he said. 
“It feels like my stomach has been ripped out this morning. But the fact we have had the first signs of some consistency — a World Cup semi-final and a Euro final — has to be a step in the right direction.” 
England, who had the advantage of playing all but one of their games in the tournament at their Wembley home, finished top of their group before beating Germany, Ukraine and Denmark in the knockout stage before falling short against Italy. 
Having infamously missed a crucial penalty in England’s Euro 96 semi-final shoot-out defeat against Germany, Southgate knows what it is like to endure taunts and jibes after such an agonising loss.  
Many past and present England players, including David Beckham and Raheem Sterling, have been vilified by Three Lions fans after major tournament failures. 
Southgate said ensuring his stars were supported after the pen­alty heartbreak was “top of his thinking”.  
“We’ve got to make sure that we’re there, and aligned with their club, and making sure that we look after those boys, absolutely,” he said.  
Southgate’s decision to send on Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho in the final moments of extra-time, specifically so they could take penalties, has drawn criticism after the gamble backfired.  
Southgate said it was emotionally very difficult to handle the loss. 
“When you’re in sport and you get to finals, those opportunities are so rare, so to be close, it’s very hard the day after. You have given everything — the emotions are drained,” he said. 
“We will go again. It’s too easy to say we can go to the World Cup in Qatar and win — but that’s a bit glib. We still have to qualify, we still have to win. You have to start the cycle again. 
“But to be able to work with these players every day has been fantastic, so when it comes to the end like it has now, it’s hard.”",Newspaper

","July 13, 2021","NASIRIYAH: At least 35 people died in a fire in the Covid isolation ward of a hospital in the southern Iraqi city of Nasiriyah on Monday.
“The death toll from the fire that ripped through the Covid isolation ward in Nasiriyah stands at 35, with five wounded, including two in critical condition,” Haydar al Zamili, a spokesman for the local health department, said. 
“The victims died of burns and the search is continuing,” he added, noting there were fears that many victims remained trapped inside the building.
Videos shared online showed thick clouds of smoke billowing from the Al Hussein hospital.
Earlier on Monday, a minor fire broke out at the health ministry’s headquarters in Baghdad, but it was quickly contained with no fatalities recorded.
The blaze at the hospital is the second such tragedy this year.
In April, a fire at a Baghdad Covid-19 hospital killed 82 and injured 110, sparked by the explosion of badly stored oxygen cylinders.

"Beijing ‘drives away’ US warship from S. China Sea
","July 13, 2021","BEIJING: China’s military said it  “drove away” a US warship that illegally entered Chinese waters near the Paracel Islands on Monday, the anniversary of an international court ruling that held Beijing had no claim over the South China Sea.
The USS Benfold entered the waters without China’s approval, seriously violating its sovereignty and undermining the stability of the South China Sea, the southern theatre command of the People’s Liberation Army said.
“We urge the United States to immediately stop such provocative actions,” it said in a statement.
On July 12, 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague ruled that China had no historic title over the South China Sea, a ruling that Beijing said it would ignore.
The Benfold asserted navigational rights and freedoms in the vicinity of the Paracel Islands consistent with international law, the US Navy said in a statement.
The islands are claimed by China, Taiwan and Vietnam, which require either permission or advance notification before a military vessel passes through.
“Under international law as reflected in the Law of the Sea Convention, the ships of all states, including their warships, enjoy the right of innocent passage through the territorial sea,” the US Navy added.
“By engaging in innocent passage without giving prior notification to or asking permission from any of the claimants, the United States challenged these unlawful restrictions imposed by China, Taiwan and Vietnam.”  Hundreds of other islands, reefs and atolls in the resource-rich waterway are contested by Brunei, China, Malaysia and the Philippines. China claims rights to resources within its so-called nine-dash line, or most of the region.
“By conducting this operation, the United States demonstrated that these waters are beyond what China can lawfully claim as its territorial sea, and that China’s claimed straight baselines around the Paracel Islands are inconsistent with international law,” the US Navy said.
In its 2016 ruling, the Hague court also said China had interfered with traditional Philippine fishing rights at Scarborough Shoal and breached the country’s sovereign rights by exploring for oil and gas near the Reed Bank.
Freedom of the seas was an  “enduring” interest of all nations, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Sunday.
“Nowhere is the rules-based maritime order under greater threat than in the South China Sea,” Blinken said in a statement.
“The People’s Republic of China continues to coerce and intimidate Southeast Asian coastal states, threatening freedom of navigation in this critical global throughway.”  China’s foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said on Monday at a regular briefing that the United States was harming peace and stability in the region.
In the Philippines, more than 100 activists gathered outside a building housing the Chinese consulate to press Beijing to respect the arbitral ruling and allow Filipinos to freely fish in the South China Sea.
The crowd marched with a Philippine flag and banners reading:  “China get out of the West Philippine Sea” and  “China out of our waters”.",Newspaper
"RSF hails Sindh law protecting journalists, calls for improvements
","July 13, 2021","KARACHI: Reporters Without Borders (RSF) and its partner, Freedom Network (FN), hail the adoption of a law protecting journalists by the Sindh Assembly, but they propose essential improvements that should be incorporated into the law during its initial implementation phase, says a press release.
The essence of the new law, passed unanimously by the Sindh Assembly on May 28, is summed up in this key article: “No person or institution, whether private or public, shall engage in any act that violates or threatens the right to life and security of any journalist or media practitioner.”
The law will help Pakistan to implement the United Nations Plan of Action on the Safety of Journalists and the Issue of Impunity, to which it signed up in 2014, and the UN Sustainable Development Goals, to which it agreed the following year.
“The very broad consensus that led to the Sindh Assembly’s adoption of the law protecting journalists should serve as an example both in the rest of Pakistan and internationally,” said Daniel Bastard, the head of RSF’s Asia-Pacific desk. “It reflects the degree to which lawmakers have become aware of the absolutely dominant role that press freedom and the safety of journalists play in the functioning of democratic societies.”
FN executive director Iqbal Khattak said: “Freedom Network is thankful to the Sindh government for supporting and passing such an inspirational special law for which the journalist community, editors, RSF and Freedom Network worked hard to help devise a mechanism to end impunity for crimes against media and its practitioners.”
The law says it aims to enable those responsible for crimes of violence against journalists to be brought to justice and to create an environment favourable to professional, independent journalism that serves the general interest.
When examining the original draft, the Sindh Assembly agreed to an amendment obligating the Sindh government to offer free legal aid to journalists facing threats or attacks who cannot afford a lawyer.
Despite this and other positive aspects, RSF and FN have identified several issues that the law has not addressed. If they continue to be neglected, the protective mechanisms it envisages will probably not suffice to combat impunity and provide journalists with full protection.
RSF and FN therefore ask the Sindh authorities to heed the following recommendations during the process of establishing the practical rules for implementing the law, known as “Rules of Business.”
Special public prosecutor: A special public prosecutor is needed to comply with the UN Plan of Action. The Sindh authorities must therefore ensure that the law creates the position of an independent special prosecutor with their own powers. This is the only way to counter the influence that individuals or groups may try to use to undermine police investigations and evidence collection, and thereby prevent crimes against journalists in connection with their work from being punished.
Representative decision-making body: The composition of the Commission for the Protection of Journalists and Media Professionals that is created by the law must be revised because, as it stands, only one of its nine members represents journalists and the other eight are government officials and representatives of media owners and editors. Journalists must be better represented.
Gender balance: The law contains absolutely no provision regarding a gender balance, which will tend to perpetuate the discrimination to which women journalists are routinely subjected in Pakistan. FN and RSF insist that at least a third of the commission’s members are women. 
Extend protection to families: In view of the different kinds of threats or attacks to which journalists are subjected, and which sometimes also target family members, FN and RSF recommend exten­ding the protection to families of the targeted journalists, when required.",Pakistan

In the FIR, she alleged that Niazi and his accomplices first abused her in the presence of her lawyer in the court of additional district and sessions judge Syed Ali Abbas, and then tried to strangulate her with an intention to take her life.
Nargis alleged that she had appeared in the court to seek bail in a 'fake case' lodged against her with the crime circle of Federal Investigation Agency, Lahore.
As she appeared before the additional district and sessions judge with her lawyer to seek bail, Niazi first exchanged harsh words with her and then hurled abuses, she said.

"Misbah mortified at Pakistan’s ODI whitewash
","July 15, 2021","KARACHI: The look of despair was quite noticeable on beleaguered Misbah-ul-Haq’s face on Wednesday. The head coach offered no excuses after Pakistan were embarrassingly overwhelmed in the One-day International series with the depleted England side recording a famous clean sweep.
Led by Ben Stokes, England — classified by experts as the ‘C’ side after the first-choice squad was forced into self-isolate following seven positive Covid-19 tests among the players and support staff — stunned the Babar Azam-led Pakistan team in all three ODIs.
			
“No one can defend such an appalling show. It was extremely poor and disappointing performance. We just couldn’t handle the conditions in the first two matches [Pakistan being bundled out for scores of 141 and 195]. It was simply not on, to be honest,” Misbah told reporters while addressing a virtual post-series conference shortly before the Pakistan squad left Birmi­ngham for Nottingham, which hosts the first T20 International on Friday.
“We put up a decent total [331-9] in the last game on the back of fine innings from Babar [a dazzling 158] and [Mohammad] Rizwan [74]. It was a kind of score which, in my view, we should have defended but didn’t.
“Overall, it was a bitterly disappointing effort from us in all departments, especially in the bowling while our fielding was pathetic to say the least throughout the series. Therefore, it would be absurd to defend our performance in the [ODI] series. The bowling was just as poor and someone like Faheem Ashraf was completely off-colour, which was surprising since he was very good in South Africa.”
Misbah, who replaced Mickey Arthur as the head coach after the 2019 50-over World Cup, negated the impression Pakistan are among the weak sides in international cricket, while recalling the victorious series this year.
“I don’t think one can rate Pakistan among the struggling teams, and if we look in the recent past Pakistan won six series in succession across all formats. We beat South Africa for times this year both home and away. Collectively as a unit we put great performances against them,” he reminisced.
“To a large extent we thought that our team was progressing on the right track. But coming to this series it appears as if we are back to square one, which is very disappointing. Having said that we just have to find solutions to ascertain as to how we are going to bounce back and also analyze why all of a sudden we went wrong against this England side.
“I don’t know what happened in the gap between the last series and since there was no competitive cricket except the [reminder of] Pakistan Super League. It’s definitely worrying sign for me as the head coach because I and the rest of coaching staff are equally to be blamed as the players if the team fails to perform.
“Obviously, when we make plans and the onus is on the players to execute them in the field but I’m a firm believer that it’s a team game and everyone involved has to shoulder the responsibility. And when certain plans are not executed, then there’s no excuse. At times, if batting clicks, poor fielding, such as yesterday [Tuesday] cost us dearly because on a pitch where there’s nothing for the bowlers and the batters are scoring 7-8 runs per over and if you start spilling catches at crucial stages, then you are clearly asking for trouble.
Misbah also lamented that lack of professionalism in all spheres of Pakistan cricket was another cause for concern which undermined the development of the international team.
“If you take a look at England, you’ll find there is a proper setup in place and that’s why they are very lucky and in a luxurious position to call upon a huge pool of players when selecting the national side,” the former Pakistan captain stressed.
“Whereas, we don’t have that sort of system and that is the reason we often struggle to find players for certain spots at the time of selection. And as all know that our middle-order batting is was problematic during the white-ball series against South Africa, which had been a major issue for a while now because the guys rushed into the side haven’t been able to settle down. At times, we have no choice but to pick those specialists who do well in domestic competitions,” Misbah added.",Newspaper
"Rawalpindi Ring Road scam: ACE arrests former commissioner, land acquisition collector
","July 15, 2021","			
LAHORE:  Punjab Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) on Wednesday arrested former  commissioner of Rawalpindi retired Capt Muhammad Mahmood and land  acquisition collector Abbas Tabish for their alleged involvement in the  ring road scam. 
ACE Director General (DG) Gohar Nafees,  addressing a press conference, said a case was registered against the  former commissioner and director of Rawalpindi ring road project and  land acquisition collector after holding a detailed inquiry. 
He  said neither approval was sought from Punjab chief minister for  alignment of the ring road, nor any no objection certificates (NOCs)  were taken from the Capital Development Authority (CDA) and the National  Highway Authority (NHA).  
“The design of the project was  changed to add new interchanges and the length of the road was increased  from 22 kilometres to 68kms and the last two kilometres would fall  under the Islamabad Capital Territory,” he said. 
Sources claimed  that the ring road’s new alignment would benefit more than 50  influential people, real estate dealers and people connected with the  project who had purchased 64,000 kanal land.  
An initial report had mentioned some members of federal cabinet were allegedly also among beneficiaries of the ring road scam.  
Following  the report, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) on Overseas  Pakistanis Zulfi Bukhari had to resign from the post, while Aviation  Minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan had denied the allegation in a press  conference.
The report of ring road scam inquiry conducted by the  ACE available with Dawn revealed that the original map was changed and  several new routes and interchanges were included in it to benefit  various housing societies. The changes in the alignment increased the  project cost to Rs25 billion. He said the previous government had  approved the alignment of the ring road in 2018, and it was changed by  the Rawalpindi’s former commissioner Mr Mahmood.  
“The change of alignment resulted in increasing the project and land costs,” he said. 
He  said a private company, Zeeruk, was hired as consultancy for the road’s  alignment and designing bridges, but no permission was sought from the  government in this regards. He added that the project director had  claimed that permission would be sought from the chief minister soon. He  said that without seek any permission the project was given to Nespak.   
“Without any need, the routes were opened for the local transport, benefiting the housing societies owners,” he said. 
Mr  Nafees said due to the new alignment, the CDA land was included in the  project and advertisements were released without seeking its permission.  
He said it was not decided to include a new portion in the ring  road and before changing the alignment of the road, Rs2.6 billion were  spent on purchasing the land. The government had later announced the  establishment of the Punjab Ring Road Authority to complete the project,  but the commissioner continued working on it, he added. 
Moreover,  he said, costly land was purchased in Attock from an unauthorised  person, while less amount was spent on purchasing land in Rawalpindi. He  said different tactics were used to purchase costly land from the  residents of Attock, which caused a huge loss to the exchequer. 
He  said former commissioner and land acquisition chairman were arrested  and were also being interrogated to identify others who benefited from  the scam, adding action would also be taken against them. 
The DG  said some big developers of housing societies in the area were  authorised to establish five interchanges on the ring road.
“This  process will benefit the developers who could build interchanges  anywhere to establish housing societies and charge the residents at  their will,” he said. 
He said no permission was sought from the authorities concerned after developing the Attock side of the ring road.  
“Nova  Housing Society was involved in selling its one file for Rs10 million,  and had earned a total Rs1.5 billion from files sale,” he said. 
He  said cases against the housing societies were forwarded to the National  Accountability Bureau (NAB), as there were thousands of affectees and  the ACE would deal with those cheating the government. 
Replying  to a query about the involvement of politicians in the scam, he said the  ACE could not find any direct investment by any politician, however,  benami investments had been found from different countries, including  Dubai. 
He said the former commissioner and project director of  Rawalpindi Ring Road also lied to Prime Minister Imran Khan in a meeting  by telling him that the design of the road was not being changed and  only service roads were being established along the ring road to benefit  housing societies. 
About any political pressure with regard to  the case, Mr Nafees said for the first time a commissioner was arrested  in a corruption case, and it was a proof there was no political or any  other pressure on the ACE. 
He said the ACE was also probing into benefit, if any, taken in allotment matters and the money earned.
“We have to investigate who took the money,” he added. 
He  said the former commissioner had changed the project and without  getting approval of allotment had issued an authority letter, increased  the length of the ring road and spent Rs2.6bn without any approval.  
“The cost of land acquisition was increased from Rs6bn to Rs16bn.”",Pakistan

"New police unit ready to deploy during rains in Karachi
","July 15, 2021","			
KARACHI: The weather forecast predicted rains for later in the week but they arrived a few days early. On Monday, there were three boats loaded atop trailers attached to as many four-wheel drive Toyota jeeps in the parking lot of the headquarters of the Special Security Unit (SSU) near Hasan Square.
Removing their protective covers revealed two boats with rudders and one row boat all painted in impressive blue and red Sindh police colours and ready for all kinds of rain emergencies in the city.
There was also an able team of 17 to 20 young men ready to man the boats and other equipment of the SSU’s Urban Flooding Rescue Unit (UFRU), which comprises the three boats, as many ambulances and two mobile workshops.
DIG-security and emergency services Maqsood Ahmed told 
: “The unit is the result of the urban flooding here in last year’s rains. All over the world, there are rescue units to deal with emergencies. And in our Third World country, we cannot even reach our public when they need us and hence begin the blame games.
“We needed resources to help our people and for that there were lengthy procedures. We decided to cut the red tape and go for what was the need of the hour. Our human resource was already trained in counterterrorism and watermanship, which we decided to utilise here. They also received further training from the Pakistan Navy and Army.
“We arranged for the boats and other equipment to set up the Urban Flooding Rescue Unit and we linked it to our Madadgar 15 helpline service for easy access to the police. It is a 24/7 service where the police boats will rescue people in case of any flooding during the rains. Also, our mobile workshops will offer additional help in case anyone’s car breaks down,” he explained, adding that the 15 helpline will also launch its free app to help people shortly.
“Logistics is also a community service,” he added.
Staying true to their motto ‘Proud to protect’, the police commandos said that they were not getting any added incentives for their new assignment.
“Many of us have volunteered to be a part of this unit. We are just glad to serve our unit,” Constable Mohammed Younis told 
.
He and his team were busy loading up the boats with bright orange life jackets, lifebuoys and yellow oars that resembled duck feet.
He said that they had recently received three weeks of training from SSG-Navy commandos. “We were a Special Weapons and Tactics [SWAT] squad and we got lifeguard and urban flooding rescue training from the navy,” he said.
The training involves rescuing civilians and calming them down. “We are trained for long endurance in water, carrying people in water. And we were all good swimmers already,” he added.
It was explained that the UFRU is currently a pilot project. “Let’s see how much we can help our people and what more is needed for this. And we will take it from there to grow further,” the constable added.",Pakistan

"Bank deposits, investments surge in FY21
","July 15, 2021","			
KARACHI: Bank deposits grew 22 per cent year-on-year fuelling both the investment and advan-ces in the just-ended fiscal year 2020-21.
According to the State Bank of Pakistan data, the banking sector deposits continued to rise reaching Rs19.795 trillion by June 30.
Bankers believe that the growth in deposits was due to record 27pc increase in remittances and a drop in consumption by the general public due to coronavirus. The data reflected that deposits increased by 10pc on a month-on-month basis.
The data showed that the credit demand also increased during the year.
The advances rose by 10pc on year-on-year basis at the end of the fiscal year on June 30. The gross advances were Rs8.996tr. The advan­ces increased by 2pc month-on-month in June.
The investments gone up by 29pc during the year compared to last year.
On June 30, the investment reached at Rs13.742tr. Due to higher deposits growth and less advances, the banks were dealing with excess liquidity in the system and ultimately the investments showed very high increase.
“With interest rates exp­ected to rise this year, banks have aggressively built positions towards the shorter end of the yield curve,” said a report of Arif Habib Research.

"Strip the shroud
","July 15, 2021","STRIP the shroud off Afghanistan. You will not find the bodies of 14,500 Soviet soldiers who died during their government’s obsessive nine-year occupation (1979-1989) of that war-savaged country.
Nor will you see the body-bags containing the remains of 2,442 US troops killed, nor over 3,800 US private security contractors (‘The Pentagon does not track their deaths’).
Do not expect to see the corpses of 1,144 personnel from the 36-nation Nato coalition that supported the US retaliation for 
, nor a memorial to 72 journalists and 444 aid workers. These collateral casualties were shipped home for a dignified burial.
They died so that 70,000 Afghan troops could sacrifice their lives defending a US-backed regime. They died so that 47,000-plus Afghan civilians could become grist to the Pentagon’s iron treadmill. They died so that over three million would be forced to escape into Pakistan and 2m more into Iran and Europe. They died so that another 4m Afghans could be displaced from their insubstantial homes. To date, which means up to the date of the US’s precipitate, ignominious departure, the US has expended over $2.26 trillion in a stillborn attempt to modernise Afghanistan’s archaic tribal society. It leaves behind 5,000 troops as ‘caretakers’ in a war cemetery without tombstones.
Despite an almost 200-year-long, unequal association between Afghanistan and Great Britain, Afghanistan escaped becoming a Bri­ti­sh colony and therefore a member of the Co­m­monwealth. It cannot benefit therefore from the assiduous attention of the Common­we­a­lth War Graves Commission, whose mission is to “honour and care for the men and wom­en of the Commonwealth forces who died in the First and Second World Wars”. The CWGC maintains 23,000 graveyards of World War casualties across the globe, including one at Rawalpindi. It was deemed important enough to be visited in 1991 by Diana, Princess of Wales.
Since the conflict in Afghanistan began, the country has endured four US presidents, three Afghan presidential puppets, and three heads of the ‘Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan’. It has survived Pakistan’s gratuitous appropriation (for its own security purposes) of inhospitable territory under the doctrine of ‘strategic depth’. If its history is any measure, Afghanistan will remain sovereign without a sovereign, a state but no nation, unstable, never free, never at peace.
Afghanistan will never experience the post-war renaissance that post-1945 Germany and Japan did. It will not become the post-1975 tourist haunt that Vietnam is, nor can it aspire to become another Lebanese phoenix. The West has left it to scavenge for its future amongst its ruins, just as ragged Iraq, Libya and Yemen are being forced to do.
Days after its troops 
 their showpiece airbase at Bagram, the US government, in an act of posthumous generosity, delivered 1.4m Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccines under the Covax Facility’s dose-sharing scheme. Another 1.9m doses are in transit. How a rump Afghani government, besieged within its beleaguered capital Kabul, will vaccinate so many Afghans across the country no one knows, or cares.
 
Covid-19 is a scourge of biblical proportions. It has ravaged mankind, disturbed social orders, wrecked economies, and exposed luxurious vanities such as wedding extravaganzas and the Olympic Games.
One can understand why, in 1964, the Japanese were keen on hosting the Summer Olympic Games. They wanted to demonstrate that, within 20 years of being defeated in the Second World War, they had ‘arrived’, were at par with the victors. The same amb­i­tion motivated the Chinese to host the Sum­mer Olympic Games in 2008. (Being an und­erdog can be a powerful, painful spur.) The Chinese are now determined to repeat their sum­mer success at Beijing in 2008 by hosting the 2022 Winter Olympics. The Chinese should anticipate a boycott. In 1980, a sanctimonious US and 65 of its acolytes boycotted the Summer Olympics in Moscow. They condemned the Soviets for invading — guess where? — Afghanistan.
The Japanese are 
 to hold the belated 2020 Olympics, whatever the Covid-19 cost. They have spent a decade planning it, exp­ended $15.4 billion already, but must exp­ect only the ignominy of empty stadiums, the sulk of disappointed ticket-holders, and the cha­g­rin of toned athletes who see years of tra­ining reduced to a virtual spectator-less spectacle.

"Microsoft says Israeli group sold tools to hack Windows
","July 15, 2021","An Israeli group sold a tool to hack into Microsoft Windows, Microsoft and other technology according to human rights group Citizen Lab on Thursday, shedding light on the growing business of finding and selling tools to hack widely used software.
The hacking tool vendor, named Candiru, created and sold a software exploit that can penetrate Windows, one of many intelligence products sold by a secretive industry that finds flaws in common software platforms for their clients, said a report by Citizen Lab.
Technical analysis by security researchers details how Candiru's hacking tool spread around the globe to numerous unnamed customers, where it was then used to target various civil society organisations, including a Saudi dissident group and a left-leaning Indonesian news outlet, the reports by Citizen Lab and Microsoft show.
Attempts to reach Candiru for comment were unsuccessful.
Evidence of the exploit recovered by Microsoft Corp suggested it was deployed against users in several countries, including Iran, Lebanon, Spain and the United Kingdom, according to the Citizen Lab report.
""Candiru's growing presence, and the use of its surveillance technology against global civil society, is a potent reminder that the mercenary spyware industry contains many players and is prone to widespread abuse,"" Citizen Lab said in its report.
Microsoft fixed the discovered flaws on Tuesday through a software update. Microsoft did not directly attribute the exploits to Candiru, instead referring to it as an ""Israel-based private sector offensive actor"" under the codename Sourgum.
""Sourgum generally sells cyberweapons that enable its customers, often government agencies around the world, to hack into their targets’ computers, phones, network infrastructure, and internet-connected devices,"" Microsoft wrote in a blog post. ""These agencies then choose who to target and run the actual operations themselves.""
Candiru's tools also exploited weaknesses in other common software products like Google's Chrome browser.
On Wednesday, Google released a blog post where it disclosed two Chrome software flaws that Citizen Lab found connected to Candiru. Google also did not refer to Candiru by name, but described it as a ""commercial surveillance company"". Google patched the two vulnerabilities earlier this year.
Cyber arms dealers like Candiru often chain multiple software vulnerabilities together to create effective exploits that can reliably break into computers remotely without a target's knowledge, computer security experts say.
Those types of covert systems cost millions of dollars and are often sold on a subscription basis, making it necessary for customers to repeatedly pay a provider for continued access, people familiar with the cyber arms industry told

"Quetta's Hanna Lake — a forbidding face of climate change
","July 21, 2021","IN the past, the 25-minute journey toward Hanna Lake used to be enchanting. The road leading to the lake had trees on both sides, green shrubs, and a shimmering channel of water running beside it.  
People would sit by the road to have picnic, wash their vehicles and rickshaws to the accompaniment of usually raucous music. The twitter of birds would lend a soothing contrast to the loud tunes. 
But conversations with people who had been to the place of late filled me with despair. According to them, the fate of this serene spot was sealed once construction magnates concluded that it can be put to better use than picknicking. 
So I decided to find out for myself. Last week I requested an acquaintance to accompany me to Hanna Lake.  
By the time we got to the lake’s vicinity, shock and sadness ambushed me. The trees and the birds have all gone. Tall buildings and the groan and clank of heavy machinery have dislodged pristine sights and sounds. 
I started cursing myself for having undertaken the trip since it had robbed me of some fond memories.  
My companion, too, was filled with nostalgia. “I used to skip my classes to come here,” he recalled. “We used to sit under the trees during school time and then return home from here directly.” 
I strike a conversation with one of the few visitors.   
Naseer Ahmad comes here frequently. But his face is now a picture of disappointment. “I brought my family to see some natural beauty. But the lake has dried up. So our weekend has been spoiled.”   
Like Naseer, female students of Karadagap Degree College, in Mastung, were sorry to see the dry lake.   
The water has evaporated thanks to a blazing sun. 
The memory of a Hanna Lake filled to the brim now seems to be a dream. In fact there was a time not too long ago when an abundance of water after snow and rain had its flip side.  
There were quite a few incidents of drowning. One of the most tragic was in 1990 when 40 people drowned after an overcrowded boat overturned. People started calling it the “Bloody Lake”.   
Situated on the outskirts of the Balochistan capital, Hanna Lake is a man-made reservoir in the far corner of the Quetta valley. It was built by the British at a time when Quetta used to be a rural town. It started expanding after the British built their cantonment.  
The lake sits in a bowl surrounded by Quetta’s eastern mountains, known as Koh-i-Murdar.  
“It used to be an abode of birds, including houbara bustard. But no bird takes the trouble to come here now,” Naseem Kakar says wistfully.  
Its forbidding look notwithstanding, people still flock to Hanna Lake because they have no alternative.  
“We come here to escape the noise and smoke of Quetta,” says a youngster.  
Mohammad Ali Batur is a Quetta-based environmentalist. According to him, it used to rain and snow a lot in Quetta during winters. “But over the past seven or eight years, the region has received little rain and snow because of climate change.” 
The only means to fight this change is tree plantation. “But instead of planting more trees, the existing trees are being chopped down,” he laments.  
However, Quetta and its vicinity have got a pleasant surprise in recent days in the shape of rain. 
Hence Hanna Lake has started accumulating water.  
But Mr Batur sees dark clouds lurking behind the silver lining. “Unseasonal rain and snow are the very definition of climate change. We hear of snowfall in places that have seen no such thing in living memory. This is a warning of disaster,” he says.  
There appears to be no relief at hand from doom and gloom.",Pakistan

"Citing differences, Sardar Naveed ‘walks away’ from Ashfaq’s PFF
","July 21, 2021","KARACHI: The rift has widened; the differences having grown. Sardar Naveed is no longer with the Pakistan Football Federation (PFF) led by Ashfaq Hussain Shah.
Naveed, the vice-president of Ashfaq’s PFF which came to power through an election held by the Supreme Court in December 2018, said he was walking away because the ideals had changed.
A few weeks ago, Naveed had raised several objections to plan by the group to sign an agreement with a company, Global Soccer Ventures Limited, which effectively gave it the rights to hold a franchise league in Pakistan.
“I don’t want to be party to that agreement which is basically a sellout of Pakistan football,” Naveed told Dawn on Tuesday. “Despite being the vice-president, I never got to see a copy of the agreement.”
The group of officials led by Ashfaq were never recognised by global football body FIFA, which appointed a Normalisation Committee to oversee football affairs in the country in September 2019. The group’s takeover of the PFF headquarters back from the NC in March this year saw Pakistan being suspended by FIFA.
“There seems to be no will or desire to get in line with FIFA and the Asian Football Confederation nor are they interested in holding talks with the NC members,” Naveed added. “At this point in time, all concentration has shifted to holding domestic events and the franchise league. And that is something I don’t agree with.”
Naveed had long been a thorn in the working of the NC. His election as Punjab Football Association president in April 2018, held on the orders of the Supreme Court, was accepted by FIFA and after the NC was appointed, he had a court ruling in his favour that he was PFA chief till 2022.
It was Naveed’s controversial election as the PFA chief in 2015, which sparked the biggest dispute in Pakistan football history and sparked a crisis that has plagued the game in the country till this day. But now he leaves a post that he’d been fighting to hold on to for years.
“The term was going to get over anyway next year and I’ve decided that I wanted to distance myself from Ashfaq’s PFF for the time being,” he said. “I wish them best of luck with their future endeavours and hope that the process of normalisation of Pakistan football continues.”",Newspaper
"Erdogan presses hard line on Cyprus, pushes for reopening of ghost town
","July 21, 2021","NICOSIA: Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan insisted on Tuesday on a two-state solution in Cyprus and threw his weight behind controversial plans for a partial reopening of a coastal resort town emptied of its original Greek Cypriot residents.
His uncompromising speech in the north of divided Nicosia marked another step towards opening up the ghost town and former resort of Varosha, in violation of UN resolutions and slammed as  “unacceptable” by the European Union.
“We don’t have another 50 years to waste,” Erdogan told a crowd at a parade to mark the 47th anniversary of his country’s invasion that divided the Mediterranean island.
He was referring to decades of failed UN-led efforts to reunite the Greek and Turkish Cypriot-controlled sectors of Cyprus.
“No progress can be made in negotiations without accepting that there are two peoples and two states with equal status,” he said.
He also voiced support for Turkish Cypriot plans to reopen a part of Varosha, effectively handing over control from the Turkish military and changing the status quo, in defiance of UN resolutions.
“The doors of a new period that will benefit everyone will open in Varosha,” Erdogan said.
Turkish Cypriot leader Ersin Tatar, who is close to Erdogan and supports a two-state solution rather than the federation long sought in UN-led negotiations, said an initial 3.5 percent of Varosha would  “be removed from its military status”.
Erdogan said this showed  “how sensitively Turkish Cypriot authorities approach this issue”.
But the European Union’s top diplomat Josep Borrell swiftly slammed any such move as  “an unacceptable unilateral decision”.
 
To cheers from Turkish flag-waving supporters, Erdogan accused the Greek Cypriots of  “blocking any route to a solution” with a  “maximalist approach...that is disconnected from the reality”.
He dismissed a warning this month from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen that Brussels would  “never accept” a two-state solution for Cyprus, an EU member since 2004.
In contrast to celebrations in the north, mournful sirens blasted across southern Nicosia at 5:30am to mark the July 20, 1974 start of the invasion.
Turkish troops seized the northern third of Cyprus in response to an aborted coup in Nicosia aimed at attaching the country to Greece.
The island is now divided between the Greek Cypriot-run Republic of Cyprus and the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, recognised only by Ankara.
“Life will restart in Varosha,” Erdogan said on the second day of his visit to the north, renewing an offer of financial compensation for Greek Cypriots who lost properties in 1974.
 
Once a playground that hosted Hollywood celebrities, Varosha was for decades a derelict ghost town, fenced off by Turkish soldiers and kept as a bargaining chip in negotiations.
But the Turkish army restored public access to parts of its beachfront last year, weeks ahead of Tatar’s election.
The United Nations Security Council responded by calling for a reversal of the decision and  “for the parties to avoid any unilateral action that could raise tensions on the island” Erdogan visited Varosha the following month in a move denounced by the Republic of Cyprus as a  “provocation without precedent”.
Since then a major thoroughfare, Demokratias Avenue, has been cleared and workers raced to spruce up the street ahead of a possible second visit.
Erdogan insisted that moves to revive the town would respect property rights.",Newspaper
"China says Washington hack claims ‘fabricated’, condemns US allies
","July 21, 2021","BEIJING: China on Tuesday said the US had  “fabricated” allegations it carried out a massive Microsoft hack, countering that Washington was the  “world champion” of cyber attacks while raging at American allies for signing up to a rare joint statement of condemnation.
The United States on Monday accused Beijing of carrying out the March cyber attack on Microsoft Exchange, a top email server for corporations around the world, and charged four Chinese nationals over the  “malicious” hack.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the attack was part of a  “pattern of irresponsible, disruptive and destabilising behavior in cyberspace”.
China’s Ministry of State Security, or MSS,  “has fostered an ecosystem of criminal contract hackers who carry out both state-sponsored activities and cybercrime for their own financial gain”, Blinken said in a statement.
In a simultaneous announcement, the US Department of Justice said four Chinese nationals had been charged with hacking the computers of dozens of companies, universities and government bodies in the United States and abroad between 2011 and 2018.
President Joe Biden told reporters the United States was still completing an investigation before taking any countermeasures, and drew parallels with the murky but prolific cybercrime attributed by Western officials to Russia.
“The Chinese government, not unlike the Russian government, is not doing this themselves, but are protecting those who are doing it, and maybe even accommodating them being able to do it,” Biden told reporters.
In an effort to put the diplomatic squeeze on Beijing, the United States coordinated its statement Monday with allies — the European Union, Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Japan and Nato.
China hit back, calling the allegations of a Beijing-supported cyber-attack campaign  “fabricated”.
“The US has mustered its allies to carry out unreasonable criticisms against China on the issue of cybersecurity,” foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters in Beijing.
“This move is fabricated out of nothing.” Earlier, China’s diplomatic missions around the world rattled out rebuttals, as Beijing made its own coordinated defence.
The Chinese embassy in New Zealand called the allegations  “totally groundless and irresponsible” while the embassy in Australia accused Canberra of  “parroting the rhetoric of the US”.
“It is well known that the US has engaged in unscrupulous, massive and indiscriminate eavesdropping on many countries including its allies,” the embassy said in a statement. “It is the world champion of malicious cyber attacks.”
Biden, like his predecessor Donald Trump, has ramped up pressure on China, seeing the rising Asian power’s increasingly assertive moves at home and abroad as the main long-term threat to the United States.
Allies backed up the castigation of China, with British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab describing the cyberattack as  “reckless”. Nato offered  “solidarity” over the Microsoft hacking without directly assigning blame.
State Department spokesman Ned Price said it was the first time that Nato — the Western military alliance whose members include Hungary and Turkey, which have comparatively cordial relations with Beijing — has condemned cyber activity from China.
“We know we’ll be stronger, we know we’ll be more effective when we act collectively,” Price said, saying the United States was not ruling out further action.
Biden has promised a strategy driven by alliances to face Beijing, drawing a contrast with Trump’s predilection for harsh rhetoric.",Newspaper
"Judges should not act like ‘judicial technicians’
","July 21, 2021","LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has ruled that the judges must not act as “judicial technicians” and the courts ought not to present themselves as a “workshop of technical justice”.
“I would say that while observance of the rules of procedure is fundamental to the course of litigation, for they provide the necessary framework for the achievement of justice between the parties, the courts, at the same time, must also be aware that too rigid adherence to the rules in certain circumstances may inappropriately and unjustly deprive a party of his right,” Justice Shahid Waheed remarks in a ruling.
He observes that the judges cannot lose sight of the fact that lawyers do make mistakes while conducting their cases which ordinarily attract sanctions or penalties.
But, in trying to give a life to substantial justice to live, some mistakes or errors which, if not fraudulent or intended to overreach, may be overlooked in order not to allow the strict compliance to suffocate the process of justice delivery, he adds.
Justice Waheed passed the ruling allowing a civil revision plea by a citizen, Syed Akif Ali Shah, who argued that his suit was illegally dismissed on technical ground by the courts below.
The judge observes that it is a trite saying that technicality is a ploy to stultify the course of justice because its use does not unredeem the wrong and the right is left unenforced.
“The case at my hands is the best example of procedural gamesmanship and poses the question whether a person who knocks at the doors of the court, hoping to find justice, be punished for mistakes, when it is common that human beings have a propensity to commit errors?” the judge writes in his verdict.
He also asks should every slight aberration of the law be visited with a denial of justice.
The judge notes that the petitioner lost his case due to the mistake of his lawyer and his claim has not been appraised. It appears, that the petitioner’s lawyer gave him an improper advice that if an amended plaint is filed during the revision proceedings, then perhaps the trial court’s order would attain finality and that the petitioner, following the advice of his lawyer, did not file the amended plaint despite taking several opportunities with the clear and cautionary orders of the trial court.
The judge says by all means this conduct of the petitioner was not good, but still it was not so that it be construed contumacious.
“Since this seems to me to be a misunderstanding of the law, I do not think the petitioner should have been punished so harshly that not only he was deprived of the opportunity to properly present his case, but also without examining the merits of his claim, his suit was dismissed solely on the ground of default and disobedience,” Justice Waheed observes.
He holds that in no way can it be said that justice has been done as such decisions are never considered appropriate as they negate the principle of fair trial, which is a fundamental right under Article 10-A of the Constitution.
The judge allowed the plea, set aside the impugned decisions and remanded the case to the trial court with a direction to give the petitioner one last opportunity to file the amended plaint, and if he does not do so then take further steps following the procedure and decide the suit afresh in accordance with law.
The petitioner has also been directed to pay the costs imposed by the trial court as his conduct resulted in undue delay.",Pakistan

"Water shortage hits Bisham
","July 21, 2021","SHANGLA: The residents of Bisham city on Monday complained about an acute water shortage blaming it on the damage caused by the recent rains to water schemes.
A jirga was held in Butyal Masjid, where the local elders and former councillors were in attendance.
The participants said the public health engineering department had executed three major schemes in Bisham city for smooth water supply to houses.
They, however, said the schemes struggled to fulfil needs due to the rising population.
The participants said while water was not available for commercial properties, the pipelines supplying water to domestic users required repair for a long time.
They said failure of the authorities to repair those pipelines had caused an acute water shortage in the city.
The elders said whenever the rain lashed Bisham, water supply to people got suspended.
They complained that the people had to fetch water from the Indus River for domestic use.
Former nazim Guldad Khan said water scarcity had become the biggest problem of Bisham.
He said the women risked their life in the rainy season to get water from the Indus River.
“The government should take steps to address water shortage permanently and the launch of a mega water scheme is one of them,” he said.
Jirga member Zahid Khan said the main water supply to Butyal was disconnected at the source leading to the damage and submerging of pipes in the river.
He demanded the laying of pipes on an emergency basis to restore water supply to the city.
The jirga demanded of the local MPA to get a large tubewell approved for the area to address water shortage.

"Swift justice for domestic violence victims urged
","July 25, 2021","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Peoples Party’s (PPP) vice-president Senator Sherry Rehman on Saturday “condemned the barbaric and gruesome murder of a girl, Noor Mukadam, in the capital and called for provision of speedy justice to all the victims of domestic violence in the country. 
“In a span of two weeks, there have been multiple cases of violence against women. With such incidents happening on a daily basis, it is important for us to discuss why the domestic violence bill is needed in Pakistan. This bill seeks to protect women, children, and other vulnerable groups from domestic violence. It also provides relief and rehabilitation to all victims of domestic violence,” Ms Rehman said in a statement. 
Discussing Khadija Siddiqi’s case, she said it was shocking that the man who had stabbed her 23 times had been granted remission on account of donating blood and on payment of the requisite fines of Arsh and Daman. She regretted that the man did not even get to complete his five-year jail sentence. 
“This is not the example that we should be setting. On the other hand, Usman Mirza who assaulted a couple (also in the capital) is still on physical remand. There needs to be swift justice in such cases,” she added. 
Ms Rehman regretted that Pakistan ranked at 151st position out of 153 countries at the Global Gender Gap Index of the World Economic Forum. She said there were countless cases which did not get reported or make it to social media but one could not deny “femicide happening” in Pakistan. 
“Someone needs to take the responsibility for Quratul Ain who was murdered by her husband within her home, or for the women who were beaten up by the men of their family. We can no longer ignore the sufferings of our women,” she added. 
Highlighting the importance of the domestic violence bill, she said that “this landmark legislation is long overdue and most certainly, the need of the hour. 
“It’s high time that we outlaw practices which are a threat to the safety and wellbeing of our women. Instead of blaming women for sexual violence, it is important that we work towards changing our culture of sexism and misogyny,” she suggested. 
“I had moved this bill in 2004 when I was an MNA. After that, devolution allowed provinces to make laws to protect women. Sindh’s law is still the model law but why is the federal government unable to accept either my law moved in 2020 in the Senate or the human rights ministry’s?” she asked. 
Ms Rehman, who is also the party’s parliamentary leader in the Senate, said the government needed to do more than just act in sporadic cases. She said there was a need for the government to institutionally have a response mechanism and an environment that enabled women to be safe and empowered in public and private spaces. 
“It is also the government’s responsibility to ensure that women feel safe to speak up against the injustices happening to them,” she added.",Pakistan
"NTDC fails to recover Rs714m from Iranian firm
","July 25, 2021","LAHORE: The National Transmission and Dispatch Company (NTDC) has failed to recover Rs714 million from an Iranian firm despite the award announced by the Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) in April last year, 
 learnt on Saturday.  
“A severe lack of on-time decision making, politics, appointment of a permanent MD, resignation of competent officers and other administrative issues are the major reasons behind the long delay in resolving various matters including recovery of Rs714m claims the NTDC had made before the ICC in a case filed by the Iranian firm against the company,” an official source told 
.  
The NTDC had in May 2020 served a notice on the firm for the payment of about Rs714m along with interest under the decision announced on April 24, 2020, in the wake of an international commercial arbitration initiated by the Iranian company in 2017 before a tribunal constituted under the ICC’s rules. 
The dispute arose out of a contract executed in February 2011 between the Iranian company and the NTDC for the design, supply, installation, testing, and commissioning of 500kV Guddu-Multan third circuit at Rahim Yar Khan substation. The NTDC terminated the contract due to persistent delays on the part of the Iranian contractor. The project was eventually completed by another contractor. 
On this, the Iranian firm initiated the arbitration in early 2017 claiming an amount of about Rs180m ($1.1m) on account of unpaid invoices and damages. The NTDC, apart from defending the claims, filed its own counterclaims on the basis of the Iranian company’s delays, the costs incurred to complete the project by another contractor, and claims related to liquidated damages, mobilisation advances, customs duties and demurrage. 
On the NTDC’s counterclaims, the tribunal declared that company had validly terminated the contract as the contractor was responsible for the delay in the project. Accordingly, it directed the Iranian firm to pay the NTDC Rs714m in different heads. The NTDC was also declared entitled to the recover interest (with effect from July 6, 2018) at the rate of 7.925 per cent per year for the Pakistani rupee portion of the damages awarded in its favour.  
“The day to day management situation in NTDC is getting worse, annoying the competent and hardworking officer. A couple of months ago, the NTDC’s Chief Financial Officer resigned, followed by Chief Legal Officer who also left over a month ago. Moreover, around six senior officers have submitted a leave prior to retirement,” the official, requesting anonymity claimed. 
He said that though the work related to Iranian firm’s assets tracing was completed and the NTDC Board – after a long time – finally approved filing of the case in the respective local court for implementation of the ICC’s decision, the company has so far failed to move ahead in this regard due to lack of interest allegedly on the part of NTDC managing directors. 
When contacted, the sitting NTDC MD Muhammad Ayub was found unaware about the situation. “I don’t know about such a huge claim the company has to recover from the Iranian firm. But I will check about this on Monday. However, as far as I know, such claims are recovered by the Central Power Purchase Agency General,” he explained. 
He admitted that delays in the constitution of the NTDC Board, resignation/retirement of officers, lack of decision-making etc might be the reasons behind the delay in following up of the case under-discussion.",Newspaper
"China claim early golds, Carapaz upstages Pogacar in road race
","July 25, 2021","TOKYO: China claimed three gold medals on the first day of competition at the Tokyo Olympics on Saturday and cyclist Richard Carapaz became just the second competitor in Ecuador’s history to top the podium, with victory in the road race. 
As the troubled build-up to the pandemic-postponed Games gave way to the first full day of competition, China secured victories in shooting and weightlifting. 
Yang Qian sparked the mini gold rush in the 10-metre air rifle competition, pipping Russia’s Anastasiia Galashina with a dramatic last-shot victory to take the very first title of the Games. 
Galashina had looked poised to win heading into the last shot, but stumbled with 8.9 on her final effort to allow Yang to grab gold. 
“It’s the 100th birthday of the Chinese Communist Party,” she said. “I’m so happy that this golden medal is a gift to my country. I’m so proud.”  
			
There was more joy for China, with Hou Zhihui taking gold in the women’s 49kg weightlifting event with an Olympic record total of 210 kilograms. 
Fencer Sun Yiwen added a third Chinese gold of the day with victory in the women’s epee. 
In cycling’s gruelling road race, 2019 Giro d’Italia winner Carapaz outfoxed a heavyweight field led by Slovenia’s Tour de France champion Tadej Pogacar. 
It was only Ecuador’s second gold at the Olympics after Jefferson Perez’s victory in the 50km race walk at the 1996 Atlanta Games. 
Japan celebrated the first goal medal of its Games when judoka Naohisa Takato won the men’s 60kg final at the iconic Nippon Budokan, beating Taiwan’s Yang Yung-wei. 
But the host nation suffered disappointment when gymnastics great Kohei Uchimura’s campaign came to an early end. 
The two-time all-around Olympic champion slipped up in qualifying for the horizontal bar competition, having battled a shoulder injury to be fit for the Games. 
“In the last three Olympic Games I’ve been able to match the level of performance I’d reached in training — but not this time,” a dejected Uchimura said. 
In another Japanese setback, world champion Daiya Seto failed to reach the final of the men’s 400 metre medley in the pool, although he has two more events. 
With spectators barred from almost all Olympic venues due to Covid-19 restrictions, the road race was a rare chance for domestic fans to glimpse the action. 
Tens of thousands lined the route of the brutal 234km (145-mile) course to watch as Carapaz prevailed in a thrilling tactical battle. 
			
“It’s an incredible moment for me,” Carapaz said. “You always have to believe. I have worked so hard to be here and it’s a huge moment for me.”  
Javad Foroughi has become the oldest Iranian athlete to win an Olympic medal, earning gold in men’s 10-metre air pistol. 
Foroughi set an Olympic record with 244.8 points, finishing 6.9 ahead of silver medalist Damir Mikec of Serbia. Chinas Pang Wei, the 2008 gold medalist, took bronze. 
The 41-year-old Foroughi surpasses Iranian weightlifter Mahmoud Namdjou, who was 38 when he took bronze at the 1956 Melbourne Games. 
Foroughi, ranked fourth in the world, qualified fifth and immediately jumped to the lead in the finals with a series of shots in the 10-ring. He led Mikec by 4.2 points entering the final two shots and celebrated by waving his towel before kneeling on it to pray. 
The spectre of Covid-19 continued to stalk the Games when German cyclist Simon Geschke was forced out of the road race while Dutch rower Finn Florijn has also tested positive. 
Seventeen new Games-related cases were announced, taking the total number to 123, of which 12 are athletes. 
Organisers were also nervously tracking the progress of a tropical storm heading towards Tokyo, with forecasters saying it could arrive on Tuesday. 
As a ‘protective measure’, organisers have brought forward to this weekend rowing events scheduled for Monday. 
As the swimming started, Britain’s Adam Peaty blasted through his heat to kickstart the defence of his 100m breaststroke title. 
Peaty, 26, arguably the greatest ever over the distance, hit the wall in an eye-catching 57.56 sec. 
American Michael Andrew, who caused a stir by refusing to be vaccinated against Covid-19 before heading to Tokyo, was third fastest. 
World champions USA thrashed New Zealand 6-1 to bounce back from a humiliating defeat to Sweden in their women’s football opener. 
 
A puss-filled horse tooth has ended Victoria Max-Theurer’s Olympic dressage dreams. The Austrian’s 11-year-old horse, Abegglen NRW, had been behaving strangely in training and, while the opening ceremony was under way on Friday night, a health check and x-Ray revealed a tooth infection. 
It would have been Max-Theurer’s fifth Olympics. 
“This news is a heavy setback for Victoria. We hope that Abegglen will feel better soon and that Victoria will continue on her path,” said Peter Mennel, of the Austrian Olympic Committee. 
Max-Theurer’s team mates Christian Schumach and Florian Bacher will now compete only as individuals. 
Dressage riders and horses are competing in qualifiers on Saturday and Sunday for the chance to win team and individual medals on July 27 and 28. 
Germany’s Isabell Werth, the most decorated Olympian in her sport, and Britain’s dressage world record holder Charlotte Dujardin, are hot medal contenders and will start competing on Sunday. 
On Saturday, the Nether­lands, Denmark and Britain got off to a strong start, while Germany’s Jessica von Bredow-Werndl scored the highest individual score, cementing her country’s leading position in equestrian sports.

"Tottenham hire Gollini on  loan from Atalanta
","July 25, 2021","LONDON: Tottenham Hotspur signed goalkeeper Pierluigi Gollini from Italian club Atalanta on a season-long loan with an option to make the move permanent, the Premier League team said on Saturday. 
The 26-year-old Gollini will be expected to challenge stalwart Hugo Lloris. The 34-year-old Frenchman has been with Tottenham since the 2012-13 season but his contract expires next June. 
“I’m here to show that I can be the future of Tottenham,” Gollini told club media. “Obviously, now I’m here with Hugo. I have huge respect for him. He’s a legend of this club. ... He’s a world champion. So for me, it’s a privilege, it’s an honour to work with him, to train with him. I’m sure I can learn a lot from him.” 
Gollini, who was part of Manchester United’s youth system, played 32 games in all competitions last season for Atalanta, which finished third in Serie A. 
“As a team we have to be really ambitious,” he said of his new team. “We should try to win something because it’s a big team, it’s a big club. Winning has to be the goal.” 
Gollini has also played in the the second-tier Championship with Aston Villa. 
He made his international debut for Italy off the bench in a European Championship qualifying match against Bosnia and Herzegovina in November 2019. 
Tottenham, under new manager Nuno Espirito Santo, hosts Premier League champion Manchester City for their season opener on Aug 15. 
The team’s seventh-place finish in 2020-21 means their only European involvement this season will be in the less lucrative and new third-tier Europa Conference League. 
Son Heung-min signed a four-year contract extension on Friday to keep him at Tottenham through June 2025. But their other star forward, Harry Kane, is hoping to leave even though he’s under contract with the north London team until 2024.",Newspaper
"Palestinian shot in clashes with Israeli troops dies
","July 25, 2021","JERUSALEM: A Pales­tinian teenager has died after being shot during clashes with Israeli soldiers at a protest over illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank, Palestinian authorities said on Saturday.
Seventeen-year-old Moh­a­m­med Munir al-Tamimi, who suffered gunshot wounds, died later in hospital, the Palestinian health ministry said, a day after the violence in the flashpoint Palestinian village of Beita.
The Red Crescent said 320 Palestinians were injured in the clashes, including 21 by live fire, 68 by rubber-tipped bullets and many others by tear gas.
Hundreds of Palestinians had gathered in the afternoon in the village of Beita, a hot spot in recent months, to protest against the wildcat settlement of Eviatar, located nearby, a photographer said.
The Israeli army said its soldiers had responded  “with riot dispersal means” after Palestinians hurled rocks at them. Israel said two of its soldiers were  “lightly injured” in the violence.
Beita has been the scene of frequent unrest since May, when dozens of Israeli families arrived and began building the settlement on a hilltop near Nablus in defiance of Israeli and international law.
After weeks of clashes and tensions, the government of nationalist Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett struck a deal with the settlers that saw them leave the Eviatar outpost.
The settlers left behind the rudimentary homes they built until the Israeli defence ministry determines whether the land can be considered state territory.
The Israeli military is maintaining a presence in Eviatar until the decision is made. The agreement was rejected by the mayor of Beita, who said on Thursday that  “clashes and protests will continue” as long as any Israeli  “remains on our land”.
All Jewish settlements in the West Bank are regarded as illegal by most of the international community.",Newspaper
"Hesco office ransacked, furniture torched over PMT blast, fire incident
","July 25, 2021","HYDERABAD: A 10-year-old victim of Thursday’s PMT blast and fire incident in Hyderabad succumbed to his burns on Saturday, taking the death toll of the Akbari Mosque tragedy to six.
The body of Arfeen, son of Mohammad Shakil Malik, was brought here from Karachi on Saturday and laid to rest in the Akbari graveyard. Some critically injured patients are still under treatment in the civil hospital and a private hospital in Karachi.
On Saturday, enraged people ransacked the Rizvi sub-division of Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (Hesco) located on Autobahn Road. They took out furniture from the office and torched it on the road.
They also torched official record inside the office. Fire tenders were called by police to extinguish the fire. 
No FIR of the rioting was registered till late in the evening. 
Angry residents of the locality blocked Autobahn Road in protest against many casualties in the tragedy. Police arrived and got the traffic movement restored.
Meanwhile, the A-Section police of Latifabad registered a case under Section 322 and 427 PPC on the complaint of ASI Hashim Ali Rajput, mentioning details of the blast and fire incident.
Qaumi Awami Tehreek leader Ayaz Latif Palijo on Saturday offered condolences to the heirs of the victims. 
Speaking to them at their residence in Latifabad Unit-8, he demanded Rs10m compensation separately from the federal and Sindh governments for each of the deceased.
He told the victims’ families that PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, Sindh governor and chief minister and federal ministers should have visited the site and the heirs the very next day. He said a murder case should be registered against Hesco officials.
He said similar incident took place in Islamabad Mohalla last month where seven children were injured and three of them later died. He said that Sindhi- and Urdu-speaking people were under “occupation of rulers”. They were paying taxes to government, he argued.

"Accused tortured Noor with knuckleduster before beheading her, court told
","July 25, 2021"," The alleged killer, Zahir Jaffer, tortured Noor Mukadam with a knuckleduster before beheading her in Islamabad’s F-7/4 sector, the investigating officer revealed before the court of the duty magistrate on Saturday.
The police had produced the accused in the court to seek extension in his physical remand.
In another development, the police investigation wing has sent a request to the immigration authorities to put the name of the alleged killer on the Provincial National Identification List (PNIL).
Duty Magistrate Suhaib Bilal Ranjha extended the remand for two days and directed the police to produce him before the judicial magistrate at the Kohsar police station on Monday.
Former ambassador Shaukat Ali Mukadam, the father of the deceased woman, reached the court of Judge Ranjha at around 10:30am. He remained outside the court for over four hours as the police produced the accused after much delay.
The counsel for the complainant, Shah Khawar, told 
 that tactics were being used to compel the victim’s family for an out-of-court settlement.
He said the police did not invoke Section 311 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), keeping in view the gruesomeness of the murder.
“The first information report (FIR) was registered under Section 302 of the PPC which is a compoundable offence and can be settled under a compromise,” Mr Khawar said, adding that Section 311 was related to Fisad-fil-Arz, which made the offence non-compoundable, and therefore the matter could not be settled out of court.
When Mr Mukadam was asked whether he had been approached for an out-of-court settlement, he replied that so far no one had asked him for a compromise, adding that he would never accept it at any cost.
Talking to 
, Investigating Officer Abdul Sattar said since he had to submit some documents before another court, the production of the accused was delayed.
When Judge Ranjha took up the case, the investigating officer informed him that the police had recovered a pistol, knife and knuckleduster from the accused after he was taken into custody.
He said clothes of the deceased and blood samples had been obtained from the crime scene while statements of the witnesses were recorded under Section 161 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC).
The officer sought extension in the remand of the accused, saying the police had to recover his mobile phone and that of the deceased to obtain valuable information and find out whether Zahir was in contact with anyone else.
 
Advocate Mohammad Danial, a junior lawyer who represented the accused, opposed extending the physical remand of Zahir Jaffer on the plea that the police had already recovered weapons from his custody and therefore further remand was no longer required.
During the proceedings, a plainclothes police official could be seen whispering in the ear of the accused, updating him about the hearing.
Addressing the judge, Zahir Jaffer said his senior counsel was not present in the courtroom. Later, a police official told the accused, “we had advised you not to speak before the judge.”
When mediapersons tried to interact with the accused, an assistant sub inspector abruptly said: “He is a very talented young man”, and then proceeded to escort him to the police vehicle.
According to the 
, the complainant and his wife had been away separately for errands. He said when they returned home, their daughter was not there, adding that his wife tried to contact her on her mobile phone but it was switched off. Later, Noor called herself and told them that she was going to Lahore with her friends and would return in a day or two and that they should not worry, Mr Mukadam said in the FIR.
On July 20, he received a call in the afternoon from the accused who told him that Noor was not with him, the FIR said, adding that at around 10pm he was informed by Kohsar police that his daughter had been murdered and asked him to come to the police station.
“The police took him to the house where he found the beheaded body of his daughter,” the FIR added.
The police have sought placement of the name of the accused on the Provincial National Identification List (PNIL).
Officers close to the investigation told 
 on condition of anonymity that Zahir Jaffer was a dual national of US and Pakistan and held passports of both countries.
They said names of people wanted by the police were placed on the PNIL for 30 days.
The officers said police directly informed the immigration authorities to put the name of wanted people on the list, which they immediately did, whereas in case of the Exit Control List (ECL), the process was time consuming.
Explaining the ECL process, the officers said a request was made to the interior ministry, which then referred the matter to the cabinet for final decision. While putting the name on PNIL, approval from an authority was not required, they added.
Meanwhile, the investigating officer, Inspector Abdul Sattar, told 
 that several items connected with the case, including mobile phones, had yet to be recovered.
The investigators are interrogating the accused for recovery of the items, including his passports, he added.
On the other hand, samples of the victim’s internal organs as well as nail scrapings had been handed over to the police who will send them for chemical examination, the investigators said, adding that DNA test would also be conducted to find out whether the woman was sexually assaulted.
A final report will be submitted once necessary details were received from the forensic department, the investigators said.",Pakistan
"Roads choked, hotels full as tourists throng Kaghan valley in record numbers
","July 25, 2021","Tourists have flocked to the Kaghan valley of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Mansehra district in record numbers this Eidul Azha, with hundreds of thousands of vehicles choking the roads and causing traffic jams in the scenic tourist site, it emerged on Sunday.
As many as 700,000 vehicles entered the valley during the Eid holidays, according to police department figures, breaking a previous record when around 500,000 vehicles carried tourists yearning for natural beauty to the region some five years ago. 
The Mansehra-Naran-Jalkhad road, which leads to Kaghan valley en route to Gilgit-Baltistan, remained choked during the first four days of Eidul Azha and the situation on this strategic artery which is in a highly dilapidated condition remained the same on the fifth day. 
			
“We have welcomed tourists in around 0.7 million vehicles to this picturesque valley and the influx of nature lovers is still on its peak even on the fifth day of the holiday,” District Police Officer Asif Bahadur told 
.
He said police were doing their utmost to manage the traffic flow despite the arrival of record numbers of tourists in the valley.
 
A tourist said it took him 12 hours to travel from Balakot to Naran, a distance that normally takes around three hours on ordinary days.
“There is an unimaginable influx of tourists since Prime Minister Imran Khan 
 this piece of heaven on earth and termed it more beautiful and scenic than Switzerland,” Mahnoor, a tourist from Karachi, said.
She said most of the visitors had to spend their nights in vehicles or on roadsides because hotels were packed in the entire valley.
			
Over the weekend, visitors remained stuck amid the traffic jam on MNJ road as well as on arteries linking exotic sites like the Saiful Muluk Lake to other areas.
Some tourists pointed out the need for developing the area's capacity to handle such large numbers of visitors.
“If the prime minister is sincere in achieving his tourism vision — Clean and Green Pakistan — he should first erect the infrastructure to deal with such massive influx as one has to travel on potholes, uneven surfaces and rocks while passing through MNJ road,” said Mohammad Akram.
He said nature lovers wanted to visit not only the Kaghan valley but other such destinations too but they lacked proper facilities. 
Foreign tourists have also thronged Kaghan valley this Eid and were seen enjoying the local culture and cuisine along with the hospitality extended to them by the local business community.
“We have welcomed foreign tourists to our restaurants in Naran and Bassal areas and they enjoyed 
 and other traditional foods being offered in the valley,” shared Hussain Deen, managing director of Moon Restaurants, a chain of eateries in the valley.
Deen, who had provided free-of-cost meals to hundreds of tourist families stranded in the valley last November when sudden snowfall cut the valley off from the rest of the country, said the business community was providing maximum relief to the visitors.
“We have been strictly following the coronavirus SOPs set by the government for the tourism industry,” he told

"Fires force evacuations in Turkey, southern Europe
","August 2, 2021","ANKARA: Dozens of villages were evacuated in tourist hotspots in southern Turkey on Sunday as wildfires that have claimed eight lives raged for the fifth day, while Greece, Italy and Spain were also hit by blazes. 
Fanned by soaring temperatures, strong winds and climate change — which experts say increases both the frequency and intensity of such blazes — this year’s fire season has been significantly more destructive than the previous average, EU data shows. 
Turkey is suffering thro­ugh its worst fires in at least a decade with nearly 95,000 hectares (235,000 acres) burnt so far this year, compared to an average of 13,516 at this point in the year between 2008 and 2020. 
A neighbourhood in the tourist city of Bodrum has been evacuated, 
 broadcaster reported, as flames were fanned by strong winds from the nearby Milas district. 
Unable to leave by road, 540 residents were taken to hotels by boats, the channel said. There were more evacuations in the resort city of Antalya, 
 broadcaster reported. 
After hitting record levels last month, temperatures are set to remain high in the region. A temperature of 49.1 degrees Celsius was recorded in the southeastern town of Cizre on July 20. 
And the mercury is expected to reach 40 degrees Celsius in Antalya on Monday. 
Turkey’s defence ministry released satellite images showing the extent of the damage, with forest areas turned black and smoke still visible. 
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been criticised after it emerged that Turkey had no firefighting planes despite one-third of its territory being forested and fires becoming an increasing problem. 
According to EU figures, Turkey has been hit by 133 wildfires in 2021 so far compared to an average of 43 by this point in the year between 2008 and 2020. 
Firefighters were also battling fires in Greece, after a major blaze broke out early on Saturday near Patras in the west. 
Five villages have been evacuated and eight people hospitalised with burns and respiratory problems in the region, which remains on alert. 
Around 20 homes have been burnt down, according to a provisional figure from the fire brigade. 
The mayor of nearby village Aigialeias, Dimitris Kalogeropoulos, called it “an immense catastrophe”.
Around 30 houses, barns and stables were consumed by flames in the villages of Ziria, Kamares, Achaias and Labiri. 
“We slept outside overnight, terrified that we would not have a house when we woke up,” a Labiri resident told Greek TV station Skai. 
The seaside resort of Loggos was also evacuated, with nearly 100 residents and tourists sent to the nearby city of Aigio. 
According to EU data, 13,500 hectares had been burnt in Greece, compared to an average of 7,500 at this point in the year from 2008-2020.",Newspaper

"Scuffles in Berlin as Covid sceptics defy protest ban
","August 2, 2021","BERLIN: Thousands of anti-lockdown demonstrators defied a court-ordered protest ban on Sunday and gathered in the streets of Berlin, resulting in scuffles with police.
Police said some protesters had  “harassed and attacked” officers and ignored roadblocks, disrupting traffic in parts of the German capital.
“They tried to break through the police chain and pull out our colleagues. This led to the use of irritants, batons and physical violence,” Berlin police tweeted.
Several people were arrested, they added.
The protest was called by the  “Querdenker” (Lateral Thinkers) movement, which has emerged as the loudest voice against Germany’s coronavirus restrictions.
Judges had banned several of its planned demos this weekend, including one for Sunday that was expected to draw some 22,500 people.
The court said it could not allow the rallies to go ahead over fears that participants would flout rules on mask wearing and social distancing, at a time when Germany’s infection numbers are on the rise again.
Berlin police deployed more than 2,000 officers in riot gear across the city, in anticipation of protesters ignoring the ban.
According to police, several thousand people turned out on Sunday, mainly in the city’s western Charlottenburg district and the centre.
Officers threatened to use water cannon to disperse crowds heading towards the Brandenburg Gate in the afternoon, after which people began to leave, police said.
Some of the demonstrators held up signs saying  “Freedom” and  “No to the corona dictatorship”, with few masks seen among them.",Newspaper
"Global media monitoring report by Uks launched
","August 2, 2021","KARACHI: Uks Research Centre organised the online launch of the country report for the sixth Global Media Monitoring Project (GMMP) on Saturday.
Beginning in 1995 with 71 countries, the GMMP is the world’s longest-running and most extensive research on gender in the news media. The research was designed to capture a snapshot of gender, basically women’s presence, on one ordinary news day in the world news media. 
Speaking at the ceremony, the Uks Research Centre director said that although she was impressed by the work put into the first report, she was not pleased to find that a report from Pakistan was not there. 
The GMMP comes out every five years and this is the third time that Pakistan has been a part of the report in coordination with Uks, she noted.
Shaista Yasmeen, the manager projects at Uks, said this country snapshot was based on the monitoring of nine newspapers, 11 news channels, the state-owned Radio Pakistan, four news-based websites and four Twitter handles. 
“The GMMP methodology provides tools and guidelines on which media to monitor and how; and the Uks team is familiar with the methodology, which we also taught to university students through a mock session prior to the actual monitoring activity. The tools remained almost the same as of the GMMP 2015, despite a few changes e.g. a separate question on Covid-19 in the coding sheets,” she explained.
Shujaat Ali, the program officer at Uks, said the GMMP monitoring day for the sixth report happened to be Sept 29, 2020. That day the chief of one of the two main opposition parties Shahbaz Sharif was arrested by the National Accountability Bureau in a money laundering case. So the news topic that gained the most coverage across the media on the monitoring day was politics and the government.
“More than 47 per cent of the total stories were related to politics that day. Fifty-one per cent of television stories were related to this topic, and on radio it was 58 per cent. Print, in comparison, provided 40 per cent coverage to this topic. Internet and Twitter also had high margins of coverage of this topic i.e 38 and 47 per cent, respectively. That day only 14 news stories out of a total of 382 were related to women politicians, which makes hardly 3.66 per cent of the total,” he said.
“The second highest coverage was on crime and violence with more than 14 per cent of monitored news items. Television provided 40 per cent coverage on this topic. Science and law got the third highest coverage, with almost 13 per cent, followed by the economy with media coverage of more than 11 per cent of the entire monitored content,” he said.
Sharing further findings he said that the overall presence of women as news subjects was 18.3 per cent. The figure decreased by half in comparison to GMMP 2015, which stood at 36 per cent. But then things could have been very different had this been a different day like March 8.
This year, the ratio was 17.5 per cent in print, radio and television, while on the Internet and Twitter, this proportion was slightly higher at 21.7 per cent. Radio remained the lowest in terms of women news subjects’ presence with seven per cent, which was portrayed in only a single news item. Twitter, on the other hand, represented women as news subjects with maximum coverage of 68 per cent. Print remained second at 22 per cent, followed by television, at 21 per cent.
A breakdown of women news subjects by function showed 89 per cent women in news stories were spokespersons for the government, any politician, minister etc., while men were 63 per cent. In contrast, 64 per cent of men were monitored as experts or commentators on news regarding the government and politics with women at only 33 per cent. No women subjects were monitored as eyewitnesses or provided any personal experience.
The overall presence of women news subjects identified by their family status was 40 per cent as compared to only eight per cent men in stories monitored across all the media.
Ali Nisar Awan, Dr Salman Asif, senior journalist Afia Salam, the report’s co-author Ahmed Yusuf and rights activist Khawar Mumtaz also shared their views and recommended coverage of more subjects and areas in the monitoring report.",Pakistan
"Lockdown aimed at disrupting economic activities in Karachi, says Haleem Adil Sheikh
","August 2, 2021","DADU: Leader of the Opposition in Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh has termed Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah’s government a security risk for the country as the chief minister went ahead with his decision on lockdown against NCOC’s advice just to disrupt economic activities in Karachi, which had barely started recovering from the ill-effects of earlier protracted lockdown. 
Sheikh said at press conferences in Jamshoro and Nawabshah on Sunday that instead of ensuring vaccination of all people the Sindh chief minister was doing politics on the issue on the directions of his boss Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari. 
He held Pakistan Peoples Party rulers responsible for the current health crisis and said the health department had not set up even a single vaccination centre where people could get vaccinated in an adequate manner. 
He said that incompetent health minister could not even pay salaries to vaccinators posted at Expo Centre in Karachi but they were involved in selling vaccines, which were provided to the province by federal government. 
Sheikh said that lockdown for a week in a city like Karachi would have ill-effects on economic activities in the entire country. PPP rulers were only interested in minting money and were least bothered to tackle the situation in an adequate manner in the light of NCOC directions, he said. 
He said that during a visit to Expo Centre in Karachi he witnessed huge crowds in long queues waiting for their turn to get vaccinated and hardly any person was able to observe SOPs while Sindh government had not made any proper arrangements for people at the centre. 
He said that the Supreme Court had ruled that provinces could not take unilateral decisions on lockdown but the Sindh government flaunted the apex court orders by imposing the lockdown. 
About suspension of work on the Sukkur-Hyderabad-Karachi Motorway, he said that provincial government was creating hurdles to the completion of the project. National Highway Authority had already released Rs14 billion to Sindh government to acquire land for the motorway but the government was dilly-dallying on its part of the bargain. 
He asked Sindh chief secretary to play his role and retrieve occupied land so that work on the motorway project could resume. Any move to halt any project of the federal government would be resisted and all such attempts would be foiled. 
  
: Sheikh told journalists on Sunday evening after offering condolences to bereaved family members of the victims of July 22 Akbari mosque transformer blast tragedy in Latifabad that compensation would be paid to heirs of the victims and prime minister would be requested to sack all the officials of Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (Hesco) responsible for the tragedy. 
He said the federal government had taken the accident seriously and the prime minister would make an announcement about the compensation within this week. 
Sheikh said that he had been attacked by ‘Zardaris’ in Nawabshah. It was the fifth attack on him in Sindh when his convoy passed through the area near Zardari House it came under attack, he said.",Pakistan
"Faisalabad ‘Aurat March’ cancelled ‘under pressure from administration’
","August 2, 2021","LAHORE: The ‘Aurat March’ Faisalabad was cancelled on Sunday allegedly under pressure from the city administration, which did not give the organisers the no objection certificate (NOC).
The students, civil society and women had planned to organise the Aurat March to raise a voice against “ongoing femicide and protest the brutal murders of women all over the country in the name of ‘isolated incidents’ and to make collective social change in the way women are treated”.
The charter of demands of the Aurat March Faisalabad, shared on its official twitter handle, spelled out the objectives of the march, saying the objectives included an end to all gender-based violence, especially violence against women, and other gender minorities by patriarchal institutions and forces. The 20 demands and objectives included protection of rights of women and transpersons, establishment of gender-based violence reporting cells, led by women or trans policewomen, a toll-free hotline for reporting domestic violence cases, special centres for abuse victims, implementation of laws against women abuse and child marriages and steps to end honour-killing incidents.
The organisers, mainly students and their teachers, had launched an online campaign in support of the march on social media days back and also applied to the district administration to issue them a no objection certificate (NOC) to hold the march on Sunday.
The Faisalabad assistant commissioner concerned allegedly did not give them permission for holding the march. The organisers had to cancel the event and they launched an online campaign against cancellation of the march on social media.
The official Twitter account of Aurat March Faisalabad tweeted: “Aurat march has been postponed due to security concerns. New update will be posted shortly” (sic).
			
The Facebook page of the Aurat March Faisalabad posted: “It’s utterly sad that the system reacted against a peaceful and democratic March that was organized by students of the city. The administration seemed horrified by the popularity and solidarity by the peoples of the city and denied providing any sort of space and protection for a peaceful demonstration, rather, resorted to harassment and threat to the organizers.
But this isn’t the end. We extend our appreciation and thank you all for showing your support. Our voices for the rights of women wouldn’t end here, this is just a drop and we would progress in our fight against patriarchy that has penetrated everywhere. The event is postponed for now, we apologise for it but we would thank you all for your support and appreciation” (sic).
Human rights and political activist Ammar Ali Jan condemned the act of the administration for, what he termed, hurling threats of dire consequences to the organisers of the Aurat March.
He tweeted, “Today’s Aurat March in Faisalabad has been cancelled. Assistant Commissioner Faisalabad threatened to arrest the organizers and called young female students to intimidate them. Its a blatant example of how the state suppresses women’s movements”.
			
While talking to 
, he said one of the organisers of the Aurat March called on Faisalabad AC to seek permission for the march but he turned down their request. He alleged that the AC also threatened the organisers with arrests of the participants of the march and cases against them.
Mr Jan alleged that a day before, members of a banned outfit Sipaha-i-Sahaba, had held a press conference to issue threats against the organisers of the Aurat March but no action was taken against them. He said the state was not allowing the people its basic right to protest against any brutality.

"Indian states agree to resolve border dispute after deadly clash
","August 2, 2021","Two states in India's north-east have agreed to resolve their differences peacefully after their long-running border dispute erupted into 
 last week.
Last Monday clashes on the demarcation between Assam and Mizoram left six police officers dead in a major embarrassment for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government.
The two regions' chief ministers tweeted on Sunday that they would now seek an “amicable” approach to the dispute.
			
Mizoram chief minister Zoramthanga urged locals to stop posting “sensitive messages” on social media while his Assam counterpart Himanta Biswa Sarma highlighted the “spirit of the north-east.”
“What happened along the Assam-Mizoram border is unacceptable to the people of both states... Border disputes can only be resolved through discussion,” Sarma tweeted.
			
The six Assam policemen were shot dead in the clashes that also left 60 people injured. Both states have blamed each other for the violence which erupted after Mizoram alleged Assam had encroached on its territory.
 in turn accused Mizoram villagers of encroaching instead on reserve forest land.
Sarma belongs to Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party while Zoramthanga, who uses only one name, heads the Mizo National Front — an ally of the ruling BJP alliance.
Mizoram was part of Assam till 1972 and became a state in its own right in 1987. The border argument has been going on since then with sporadic violence.
Indian media on Monday said the government might rely on satellite mapping to define the boundaries to help settle the dispute and others in the region.",World
"Noor Mukadam murder: Zahir Jaffer remanded in judicial custody for 14 days
","August 2, 2021","A district and sessions court in Islamabad on Monday remanded Zahir Zakir Jaffer — the primary suspect in Noor Mukadam's

The suspect was produced in the court of Judicial Magistrate Shaista Khan Kundi following the completion of his 
 granted on Saturday. 
The court accepted the police's request for the suspect's judicial remand and ordered for him to be produced before it on August 16.
The prosecutor told the court that police had, for now, completed their investigation with regards to the suspect and that they no longer required his physical custody. 
The judge responded that there was nothing like a ""complete investigation for now"". 
""A complete investigation is complete,"" said the judge, adding that the police would keep bringing supplementary challans. 
""Where is the accused Zahir Zakir Jaffer?"" questioned the judge and asked him if he wanted to say anything to the court to which Jaffer responded that his lawyer would speak for him. 
Noor, 27, daughter of former Pakistani diplomat Shaukat Mukadam, was found murdered at a residence in Islamabad's upscale Sector F-7/4 on July 20.
A first information report (FIR) was registered later the same day against Jaffer, who was arrested from the site of the murder, under Section 302 (premeditated murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code on the complaint of the victim's father.
In his complaint, Shaukat Mukadam had stated that he had gone to Rawalpindi on July 19 to buy a goat for Eidul Azha, while his wife had gone out to pick up clothes from her tailor. When he had returned home in the evening, the couple found their daughter Noor absent from their house in Islamabad.
They had found her cellphone number to be switched off, and started a search for her. Sometime later, Noor had called her parents to inform them that she was travelling to Lahore with some friends and would return in a day or two, according to the FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com.
The complainant said he had later received a call from the suspect, son of Zakir Jaffer, whose family were the ex-diplomat's acquaintances. The suspect had informed Shaukat that Noor was not with him, the FIR said.
At around 10pm on July 20, the victim's father had received a call from Kohsar police station, informing him that Noor had been murdered.

"Afghan team has arrived to probe Afghan ambassador's daughter's alleged abduction: Sheikh Rashid
","August 2, 2021","Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid said on Monday that a team from Afghanistan had arrived to investigate the abduction of the Afghan ambassador’s daughter. 
Ambassador Najibullah Alikhil’s 27-year-old daughter Silsila Alikhil was allegedly 
 and tortured by unidentified persons last month while returning from a bakery in Blue Area before being dropped alongside a road with her hands and feet tied and a note that “your turn is next” and “communist”.
Addressing a press conference in Islamabad, the interior minister said: ""The Afghan team has arrived for investigation of the Afghan ambassador's daughter's case. I have instructed the inspector general of police to hand over the [investigation results] based on facts and the truth to the Afghan investigation committee."" 
Rashid said the police had completed the investigation and were fully prepared to answer any questions of the Afghan team.
Questioned on the Afghan team's freedom to operate, the interior minister said ""they [are free to carry out] their investigation. Pakistan is a free country and they are in contact with the FO."" 
Rashid added that he had given police clearance to share its investigation and footage with the Afghan team along with access to 18 people — including the four taxi drivers. ""If they (Afghan team) want, they can interview them as well,"" he said. 
The interior minister also commented on the 
 and said he had given his utmost effort and collected witnesses in the cases and gotten forensic investigation carried out. ""Now I can't get him (Noor's killer) killed in a police encounter because the social media is so pervasive [...] the decision is of the courts, the testimonies are complete and I hope he will be given the death sentence."" 
			
The interior minister said that he had instructed the deputy commissioner of Islamabad, Hamza Shafqat, to remove all encroachments and illegal constructions from Islamabad's nullahs by August 30, adding that he would personally supervise the operations. 
He clarified that the order was ""only for nullahs"" in order to remove constructions that blocked the flow of water. The interior minister's comments come in the wake of 
 in Islamabad last week that caused urban flooding and resulted in the deaths of two people. 
The 
 for the tragedy were weak regulatory checks on housing societies by the civic agency and district administration along with narrowing of nullahs due to illegal constructions. 
Regarding other matters in the capital, he said he had also instructed the chairman of the Capital Development Authority to secure the diplomatic enclave and install 190 security cameras. 
Rashid also said that the National Database and Registration Authority had decided to issue Covid-19 vaccination certificates and a vaccine verification system for foreigners as well. 
On peace and security in the upcoming month of Muharram, the interior minister said a meeting would be held on the issue on Thursday but the Ministry of Interior had issued instructions to maintain peace and calm during the month.
Rashid also addressed the issue of officials serving for extended periods of time in foreign missions, saying that 64 individuals had been recalled and new appointments were being made. Addressing such individuals, the interior minister said if they didn't return to the country and report to their offices by August 30, they would be suspended.

"Citizens without CNICs eligible for Covid-19 vaccination in Karachi
","August 2, 2021","Citizens in Karachi who do not posses computerised national identity cards (CNIC) are now eligible for receiving Covid-19 vaccines after on-the-spot biometric registration at the Mass Vaccination Centres in the city, the Sindh Health Department confirmed to 
 on Monday.
Earlier on July 30, Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah had 
 would be administered to citizens without CNICs, adding that modalities were being reviewed for the purpose.
For her part, the Sindh Health Department’s media coordinator, Mehar Khursheed, said citizens can get their biometrics done at the vaccination centre and register the cell phone number they are currently using.
Explaining the process, she said, “Every vaccine dose has to be documented. We need to write down the name and details of every person. The biometric facility is available at Expo Centre in Karachi and is being expanded to other 24/7 Mass Vaccination Centres across the city. Where biometric is not available, a valid mobile number will be used.”
The health department official said over 2,000 citizens without CNICs have been vaccinated so far in Karachi.
Besides the Karachi Expo Centre, the 
 in the city include Dow Ojha Campus, Khaliq Dina Hall, Jinnah Hospital, Lyari General Hospital, Children's Hospital, SG Hospital New Karachi, SG Hospital Liaquatabad, Sindh Government Qatar Hospital, SG Hospital Murad Memon Goth, SG Hospital Korangi and SG Hospital Saudabad.
The move is expected to help a large number of citizens who do not posses CNICs and have so far been excluded from the vaccination drive.
During the press conference on July 30, CM Shah had said that vaccine rollout would be expanded to include citizens without CNICs, adding however that they had to find a way to keep a tab on the doses. 
“The vaccines were disbursed by the federal government and we have to account for each dose. Any misappropriation is strictly being monitored. We had asked the federal government a while ago to allow vaccination of people without CNICs and took permission for some cases.”
“We have proposed a system that the number on the vaccination card [issued to people without CNICs] could be considered as a unique identification number. We are discussing it with the federal government. We had vaccinations done which included some destitute women in the city,” he added.
The Sindh government had on Friday decided to impose a lockdown in the province from from July 31 till August 8 amid rising Covid-19 cases.
“During this nine-day lockdown, we want people to come out of homes only for vaccination purposes and no other activity whatsoever,” 
 in a presser the next day.
Explaining the initiatives taken by the Sindh’s coronavirus task force, Wahab had said that the provincial administration had decided to use a “tactic” to persuade people to get themselves vaccinated.
“In this regard, it was decided that mobile SIM cards of unvaccinated people will be blocked, and you can see vaccination stats after four days of the announcement — there’s an exponential increase in it,” he said.",Pakistan
"Taliban seize another provincial capital in Afghanistan
","August 8, 2021","KABUL: The Taliban seized the stronghold of a notorious Afghan warlord on Saturday, officials said, the second provincial capital to fall to the insurgents in under 24 hours. 
The deputy governor of Jawzjan province said he was with government forces who had abandoned Sheberghan city and retreated to the airport on its outskirts, where they were preparing to defend themselves. 
The city is home to warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum, who only 
 to Afghanistan this week from medical treatment in Turkey, but is currently in Kabul. 
Aides said he was meeting President Ashraf Ghani on Saturday in an attempt to persuade the country’s leader to fly in reinforcements. 
“We have demanded the government deploys at least 500 commandos so we could work to retake the city,” said his party’s spokesman, Ehsan Niro. 
The Taliban have taken control of vast tracts of rural Afghanistan since early May when they launched a series of offensives to coincide with the start of the final withdrawal of foreign troops. 
Afghan government forces largely abandoned the countryside to the insurgents, but are now scrambling to defend a string of cities. 
The war has also returned to the capital, with a senior government information official shot dead in the street on Friday, three days after the defence minister survived a brazen 
 involving a car bomb and Taliban hit squad. 
Qader Malia, deputy governor of Jawzjan province, said Sheberghan had “unfortunately fallen”, but interior ministry spokesman Marwais Stanikzai insisted the insurgents held only parts of the city. 
“The security forces, backed by reinforcements and the uprising forces, will once again clear the city from the terrorists,” he said in a video message to media. 
That has been a familiar response to most Taliban gains of recent weeks, although government forces have so far largely failed to make good on promises to retake dozens of districts and border posts. 
One resident of Sheberghan said people were staying behind closed doors, fearful for their future. “The Taliban are everywhere, with their flags, but from what I see through the window the streets are deserted and we do not dare leave our homes,” he said, asking not to be named. 
“The fighting has subsided inside the city... but we hear that the Taliban are moving towards the airport.” 
On Friday, Zaranj city in Nimroz fell “without a fight”, according to its deputy governor, becoming the 
 by the Taliban. 
There was more resistance in Sheberghan, several sources said, but an aide to Dostum confirmed the city had been taken. 
Dostum has overseen one of the largest militias in the north and garnered a fearsome reputation fighting the Taliban in the 1990s — along with accusations his forces massacred thousands of insurgent prisoners of war. 
Any retreat of his fighters would dent the government’s recent hopes that militia groups could help bolster the country’s overstretched military. 
In Zaranj, social media posts suggested the Taliban were welcomed by some residents of the desert city, which has long had a reputation for lawlessness. 
They showed captured military Humvees, luxury SUVs, and pickups speeding through the streets, flying white Taliban flags as local residents — mostly youths and young men — cheered them on. 
On entering Zaranj the insurgents opened the gates of the city jail, officials said, freeing Taliban prisoners along with common criminals. 
Videos on Twitter showed mobs looting government offices, stealing desks, office chairs, cabinets, and televisions. 
Fresh social media video emerged on Saturday of similar scenes purporting to come from Sheberghan. The veracity of the clips could not immediately be confirmed. 
“The Afghan security forces lost their morale due to intense propaganda by the Taliban,” a senior official from the city, who asked not to be named, said. 
“Most of the security forces put their weapons on the ground, took off their uniforms, and left their units,” he said. 
Elsewhere in Afghanistan, fighting was raging in Herat, near the western border with Iran, and Lashkar Gah and Kandahar in the south. 
From Kunduz, activist Rasikh Maroof said by phone on Saturday that fighting was heard throughout the night on the outskirts of several parts of the city, with the Taliban apparently unable to make significant inroads. 
Despite the deteriorating situation, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said that President Joe Biden still believed it was right to pull US troops out after 20 years of war.",Newspaper

“Free and credible elections using technological advancements is the need of the time. The ministry of science and technology is playing its active role in expediting the process towards electronic and transparent elections,” he said, adding that this was the much-needed step to ensure transparent elections in the country.

"$1tr US infrastructure bill advances
","August 8, 2021","WASHINGTON: The US Senate voted to advance a $1 trillion infrastructure package on Saturday, an important procedural step forward after months of negotiations between President Joe Biden and a bipartisan group of senators.
In a 67-27 vote demonstrating broad support, senators agreed to limit debate on the legislation, which represents the biggest investment in decades in America’s roads, bridges, airports and waterways.
Eighteen of the Senate’s 50 Republicans voted to move forward on the legislation, with Senators John Cornyn and Deb Fischer backing the package for the first time.
But the timing for passage remained unclear, as lawmakers prepared for expe­cted votes on amendments and worked behind closed doors to reach an agreement that would allow the Senate to complete its work on the legislation quickly.
“We can get this done the easy way or the hard way. In either case, the Senate will stay in session until we finish our work,” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a floor speech before the vote.  
Biden tweeted his support ahead of the vote, saying the  “once-in-a-generation inve­s­tment in our nation’s infrastructure” would create good-paying jobs refurbishing America’s roads, bridges, water systems and electrical grid.
“We can’t afford not to do it,” the president said.  “We can’t just build back to the way things were before Covid-19, we have to build back better.”",Newspaper
"Romashina says goodbye after her seventh gold
","August 8, 2021","TOKYO: Holding back tears, her freshly won seventh Olympic gold medal hanging around her neck, Svetlana Romashina announced the end of the greatest Olympic career in artistic swimming history.
After leading the Russian squad to victory in the team event on Saturday, the 31-year-old Romashina wants to embrace motherhood. 
Already the mother of a three-year-old daughter, Romashina said it’s time to leave the sport and have another child. 
“It will be my last Olympic Games as an athlete. Maybe [in the future] you will see me [as] a coach, Romashina said. I just want to be with my family now. I want to have my second baby The sixth and the seventh [golds] were the [toughest] in my life. I became a mother and it was very difficult to be a mother and an athlete at one moment. If I tell you about my daughter I will cry.” 
Romashina has won or been on the winning team of every single event she’s participated in at four Olympics.

"Root eyes ton as England battle hard in first Test
","August 8, 2021","NOTTINGHAM: England captain Joe Root was left eyeing a hundred as wickets fell around him to leave the first Test against India at Trent Bridge intriguingly poised at tea on Saturday’s fourth day. 
England were 235-5 in their second innings, a lead of 140 runs. 
Root was 96 not out, having top-scored with 64 in England’s meagre first innings 183. 
Jos Buttler, the last of England’s recognised batsmen, was unbeaten on 15 after avoiding a pair. 
Frustratingly for England, Dom Sibley, Jonny Bairstow and Dan Lawrence all got to 25 before they each played a major part in their own dismissal — for all the excellence of India’s attack. 
England resumed Saturday on 25 without loss, 70 runs adrift of India’s first innings 278. 
After three rain-marred days, play started beneath sunny blue skies, with Rory Burns 11 not out and Sibley unbeaten on nine. 
There was little left-hander Burns could do with a brilliant Mohammed Siraj delivery that seamed late to have him caught behind for 18. 
Jasprit Bumrah prolonged Zak Crawley’s run of low scores when, he squared up the batsman, with wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant holding a fine diving catch low to his right. 
Crawley’s exit for six meant he had scored just 156 runs in 14 Test innings since his 267 against Pakistan at Southampton last year. 
Root, at 46-2, once more walked out to bat with England in trouble. 
He had made nine when he nicked another good delivery from Bumrah just short of India captain Virat Kohli at first slip. 
Root, however, showed his class with two boundaries in four balls off Siraj — a textbook cover-drive followed by a clip through midwicket. 
England’s best batsman completed a 68-ball fifty by deliberately uppercutting Mohammed Shami over the slips for his eighth four. 
England were 119-2 at lunch, with Sibley 27 not out and Root 56 not out. 
But a third wicket partnership eventually worth 89 ended in tame fashion when Sibley — whose 28 took a laborious 133 balls -- drove loosely at Bumrah and was brilliantly caught, two-handed, by a diving Pant off the inside edge. 
England were now 135-3, with Bairstow walking out into a more gloomy middle, lit up by the floodlights that favoured India’s quicks. 
Bairstow, however, was largely untroubled until, on 30, he gave his wicket away by pulling a short ball from Siraj straight to deep square leg. 
Root almost fell in similar fashion to Yorkshire team-mate Bairstow but his pull off Shami dropped just short of Jadeja. 
Lawrence avoided a pair and repeatedly punished India for straying onto his pads only to play round a straight ball from Shardul Thakur to be lbw for 25. 
England squandered a review trying to overturn a decision that clearly looked out and were still 211-5. 
Buttler, one of a quartet of England first-innings ducks, got off the mark by flicking Bumrah off his pads and two balls later stylishly cover-drove him for another boundary.

District  Police Officer Asad Sarfraz told 
 that more than 150 persons were  wanted in three different FIRs registered of the incident. He added that  police raids were on to arrest the remaining suspects. 
The DPO  said besides the information provided by intelligence agencies, the  police were also using the videos clips of the attack uploaded on social  media to identify the culprits.  
In a statement from Lahore, Inspector General of Police Inam Ghani said 52 of the miscreants involved in the attack on the temple, including the main accused, had been  arrested.  
He said police teams were conducting search operations in different areas of the district to  arrest the remaining accused.  
He said  the arrested accused were produced before the  anti-terrorism court in Bahawalpur which sent them to jail on judicial remand. An RYK police spokesman said 36 of the arrested were produced before the ATC. 
He said the temple restoration work had been started which would be completed in the next few days while all the  expenses incurred on the restoration would be recovered from the accused. The IGP said the prime minister and chief minister were being kept informed of the  progress.  
On the other hand, some local religious  leaders condemned the attack on the temple and stressed the need for restructuring the District Peace Committee (DPC) to avert such incidents in future.

He regretted  that many members of the DPC did not actually represent their respective  parties and sects.  
He was of the view that if the DPC had timely intervened, the Bhong incident would not have happened.

 that the provincial government had approved funds for land acquisition in the recent budget, but the allocation of Rs50 million each for the two projects was too small and the revenue department would not be able to acquire the land under the Compulsory Land Acquisition Act.
They said that the federal government had allocated Rs4.65 billion for the road project, but the National Highway Authority could not go ahead till the land was acquired by the provincial government required for expansion of its width to 32 feet from the present six feet.
An officer of the revenue department said that for land acquisition full allocation of funds was required for payment to the landowners as required under the rules.
The University of Chitral project pertained to the era of Nawaz Sharif government and the federal government had allocated Rs3 billion for construction of its building in 2017-18 budget, but it could not be utilised as then provincial government did not acquire the land.
A source in the university said the amount had been reflected in the budgets of the federal government since 2018, but the provincial government had not approved funds for purchase of land till December last year when the chief minister announced Rs1.9 billion as non-ADP project.
He said the amount could not be released by the provincial government as promised and only Rs50 million was allocated leading to further delay.
When contacted, special assistant to the chief minister on minorities affairs, Wazir Zada, insisted that the required funds would be released as and when the revenue department fulfilled the codal formalities by promulgating different sections of the Land Acquisition Act.
He said the Provincial Development Working Party would approve the release of the amount finally calculated and required by the revenue department.",Pakistan
"Pakistan rejects 'baseless Indian allegations of infiltration' across Line of Control
","August 8, 2021","Foreign Office spokesperson Zahid Hafeez Chaudhri on Sunday rejected reports published by Indian media which quoted an Indian official as saying that ""terrorists are waiting at launch pads to infiltrate"" into occupied Kashmir from Pakistan. 
""We categorically reject the baseless allegations that Pakistan wanted to infiltrate so-called 'terrorists' via the Line of Control (LoC),"" Chaudhri said in a statement. 
In a report published earlier this week, Indian publication 
 an unnamed security official as saying that ""140 terrorists are waiting at launch pads to infiltrate into Jammu and Kashmir and the terror infrastructure across the LoC remains in place. 
""The [Indian] army had been noticing the continued presence of around 140 terrorists at the launch pads across the LoC, likely waiting to infiltrate into Jammu and Kashmir, but the robust counter-infiltration grid had so far desisted them from making any such attempts,"" the report said. 
""They tried in the past, but had to return after alert jawans foiled their nefarious designs,"" the official said, according to 
. 
In his statement today, Chaudhri said India's ""smear campaign against Pakistan is well-known and was fully exposed"" by EU DisinfoLab last year in its investigation titled 
. 
The Brussels-based EU DisinfoLab had 
 a vast network of 265 coordinated fake local media outlets in 65 countries serving Indian interests, as well as multiple dubious think tanks and NGOs. The network was active in Brussels and Geneva in producing and amplifying content designed to, primarily, undermine Pakistan.
""The Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) is one of the most militarised zones in the world with over 900,000 Indian security personnel. India has erected multi-tiered fence, installed electronic surveillance equipment and set up multiple layers of security, making it impossible for anything to cross the LoC to enter IIOJK. Therefore, such allegations recycled from time to time have no basis to stand on,"" Chaudhri pointed out.
On the other hand, India has been involved in state terrorism in occupied Kashmir against Pakistan and in other areas of the country, including the 
 in June, he noted.
The FO spokesperson also recalled that Pakistan had, in 2020, presented a 
 on India's ""aiding, abetting and financing of state-sponsored terrorism against Pakistan"" to the international community. 
Referring to the 
 between Pakistan and India earlier this year, in which both countries had recommitted themselves to the 2003 ceasefire arrangement at the Line of Control, Chaudhri said it was done ""in the interest of regional peace and security and to save Kashmiri lives"".
""India must not use baseless and misleading allegations of so-called 'infiltration' attempts as a handy ploy to find excuses to scuttle the ceasefire understanding,"" he added. 
""India must also refrain from peddling falsehoods and creating pretexts for false flag operations. Such irresponsible conduct would only result in further undermining peace and security in the region,"" the FO spokesperson said. ",Pakistan
"Explainer: Beyond Delta, scientists are watching new coronavirus variants
","August 8, 2021","The continued spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spawned a Greek alphabet of variants — a naming system used by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to track concerning new mutations of the virus that causes Covid-19. Some have equipped the virus with better ways of infecting humans or evading vaccine protection.
Scientists remain focused on Delta, now the dominant variant rising rapidly around the world, but are tracking others to see what may one day take its place.
The Delta variant first detected in India remains the 
. It is striking unvaccinated populations in many countries and has proven capable of infecting a higher proportion of vaccinated people than its predecessors.
The WHO classifies Delta as a variant of concern, meaning it has been shown capable of increasing transmissibility, causing more severe disease or reducing the benefit of vaccines and treatments.
According to Shane Crotty, a virologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in San Diego, Delta's ""superpower"" is its transmissibility. Chinese researchers found that people infected with Delta carry 1,260 times more virus in their noses compared with the original version of the coronavirus. Some US research suggests that the ""viral load"" in vaccinated individuals who become infected with Delta is on par with those who are unvaccinated, but more research is needed.
While the original coronavirus took up to seven days to cause symptoms, Delta can cause symptoms two to three days faster, giving the immune system less time to respond and mount a defence. Delta also appears to be mutating further, with reports emerging of a ""Delta Plus"" variant, a sub-lineage that carries an additional mutation that has been shown to evade immune protection.
India listed Delta Plus as a variant of concern in June, but neither the US Centres For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) nor the WHO have done so yet. According to Outbreak.info, an open-source Covid-19 database, Delta Plus has been detected in at least 32 countries. Experts say it is not yet clear whether it is more dangerous.
The Lambda variant has attracted attention as a potential new threat. But this version of the coronavirus, first identified in Peru in December, may be receding, several infectious disease experts told 
.
The WHO classifies Lambda as a variant of interest, meaning it carries mutations suspected of causing a change in transmissibility or causing more severe disease, but it is still under investigation. Lab studies show it has mutations that resist vaccine-induced antibodies.
Dr Eric Topol, a professor of molecular medicine and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California, said the percentage of new Lambda cases reported to GISAID, a database that tracks SARS-CoV-2 variants, has been dropping, a sign that the variant is waning.
In a recent call with the CDC, disease experts said Lambda did not appear to be causing increased transmissibility, and vaccines appear to be holding up well against it, said Dr William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Centre who attended the discussion.
The B.1.621 variant, which first arose in Colombia in January, where it caused a major outbreak, has yet to earn a Greek letter name.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has listed it as a variant of interest, while Public Health England describes B.1.621 as a variant under investigation. It carries several key mutations, including E484K, N501Y and D614G, that have been linked with increased transmissibility and reduced immune protection. So far, there have been 37 likely and confirmed cases in the UK, according to a recent government report, and the variant has been identified in a number of patients in Florida.
Dr Anthony Fauci, the White House's chief medical adviser, recently warned that the United States could be in trouble unless more Americans get vaccinated, as a large pool of unvaccinated people gives the virus more opportunity to spread and mutate into new variants.
Proponents of greater international distribution of vaccine doses by rich countries say the same thing could happen as variants emerge unchecked among the populations of poor nations where very few people have been inoculated.
Even so, a key issue is that the current vaccines block severe disease but do not prevent infection, said Dr Gregory Poland, a vaccine scientist at the Mayo Clinic. That is because the virus is still capable of replicating in the nose, even among vaccinated people, who can then transmit the disease through tiny, aerosolised droplets.
To defeat SARS-CoV-2, he said, will likely require a new generation of vaccines that also block transmission. Until then, the world will remain vulnerable to the rise of new coronavirus variants, according to Poland and other experts.",World
"Pakistan’s top diplomat in UK hopeful of red list exit
","August 11, 2021","LONDON: Pakistan’s High Commissioner to the UK Moazzam Ahmad Khan on Tuesday said he is optimistic that the British government will remove Pakistan from its red list in the upcoming travel update on August 26.  
In a briefing to journalists here, Mr Khan outlined the mission’s engagement with British authorities on their decision to keep travel from Pakistan restricted, and said officials here should re-examine data from Pakistan taking all elements into account.  
He also dismissed reports of a communication gap between the two countries on the Covid-19 issue.  
“We feel the system they [British authorities] have adopted to assess Pakistan does not present an accurate picture of our Covid-19 situation, and this needs to be corrected,” he said.  
“This is not criticism, but it is important to share our point of view. There is no communication gap, we are constantly in touch with them. In fact, I had an opportunity to speak to Prime Minister [Boris] Johnson and brought it to his attention that keeping Pakistan on the red list has left both people in Pakistan and the diaspora frustrated and disappointed. He said ‘we are looking into it’.”  
Mr Khan said that two of the key reservations communicated by British authorities regarding Pakistan are insufficient genomic surveillance of new variants, and low testing. He added that lack of data was not a concern raised by UK authorities.  
The high commissioner said: “Perhaps comparatively this [lower testing] may be the case, but we feel the sample size of our daily tests is adequate to make informed decisions.”  
He said that alongside daily cases data, the British authorities have been requested to look at daily deaths. “Those cannot be hidden, and the demand for oxygen and ventilators too cannot be concealed. So their decision should not be based on one thing, but after considering all factors. We feel when assessing Pakistan’s situation, all elements were not considered.”  
Mr Khan said the UK government’s main aim was to prevent entry of infected passengers, especially the entry of a new variant, into the UK. He felt that through PCR and antigen tests, this goal could be achieved.  
“They are concerned about new variants [coming into the UK] and say our genomic surveillance is not adequate. Of course, there may be room for more work, but our data gives us a clear picture. And our assessment shows that the variant of concern in Pakistan is not Beta, but mainly the UK and then Delta variant.”  
He praised Pakistani authorities’ efforts to control Covid-19, and said the work done to contain the disease in Pakistan was “exemplary”. “We have fared better than stronger countries, some of which are on the green or amber list.”",Newspaper
"Protected National Park encroached upon by govt entities & private parties, IHC told
","August 11, 2021","ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has observed that government entities and private parties have encroached upon the protected National Park while the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB) and civic agencies have turned a deaf ear to these serious environmental issues. 
The observation came during the hearing on Tuesday by IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah of a petition filed by academician Prof Zahid Baig Mirza through Advocate Mohammad Aslam Khaki and Afzal Siddiqui. 
The court was informed that “the National Park area has been illegally encroached by various private persons and government entities, including Pakistan Air Force and Pakistan Navy”. 
As per the court order, the encroachment on the National Park is contemptuous and the contemnors are liable to be prosecuted. 
IWMB chairperson Rina Saeed Khan was asked whether any action has been taken to remove the encroachments and whether proceedings have been initiated against the persons involved, including the heads of government entities who had allegedly chosen to take the law into their own hands. 
When Ms Khan responded in the negative, Chief Justice Minallah expressed displeasure and remarked that “inaction on part of public functionaries is beyond comprehension and deprecated because their conduct is exposing future generations to serious consequences due to environmental degradation and climate change”. 
The court directed the Capital Development Authority and IWMB to “forthwith fulfil their respective statutory obligations by identifying illegal encroachments of the specified area of the National Park and ensure that they are removed”. 
The court also directed the interior secretary to provide assistance to these functionaries so that the specified area of the National Park is restored and those who have violated its notified limits are held accountable. 
Chief Justice Minallah said it was “needless to mention that no one is above the law”.",Pakistan

"England recall Moeen Ali for second India Test
","August 11, 2021","LONDON: Moeen Ali has been recalled to the England squad for Thursday’s second Test against India. 
The 34-year-old all-rounder has played only one Test match in the last two years, against India in Chennai almost six months ago, but will link up with the team at Lord’s. 
England were outplayed for large periods of the drawn opener at Trent Bridge last week and are looking to rebalance the side in the continued absence of all-rounders Ben Stokes and Chris Woakes. 
Moeen has played only white-ball cricket since his last Test appearance in February when he took eight wickets and hit a second-innings 43 in a losing cause. He twice dismissed India captain Virat Kohli in that match but played no further part in the series, taking a scheduled rest as part of the ECB’s rotation policy. 
Since then, Moeen has resumed his status as a white-ball specialist, most recently as Birmingham Phoenix captain in the inaugural season of The Hundred. 
He leaves that competition in a blaze of glory, with his team top of the standings and fresh from scoring a brutal 59 against Welsh Fire on Monday which saw him hit five sixes and three fours in just 28 balls. 
“We’ll look at conditions and weigh things up but he’s in a great position to play,” said England captain Joe Root. “That’s why he’s been called up to the squad, for his capability with both bat and ball. Albeit in a short format he’s in great form at the minute, playing with great confidence, and we all know what he’s capable of in the Test arena. He’s scored big hundreds and won the games with the ball as well and he’s a fine cricketer.

"WHO urges power players to end ‘disgraceful’ jab inequity by Oct
","August 11, 2021","GENEVA: The World Health Organisation on Tuesday urged the 20 leaders with the power to overturn the  “disgraceful” global imbalance in access to Covid-19 vaccines to reverse the tide before October.
The WHO’s Bruce Aylward said the world should be  “disgusted” — and asked whether the situation could have been any worse had there been an active effort to block the planet’s poor from getting vaccinated.
The UN health agency has been increasingly infuriated by what it sees as the moral outrage of rich countries hogging vaccine supply while developing nations struggle to immunise their most vulnerable populations.
Aylward, the WHO’s frontman on accessing the tools to fight the coronavirus pandemic, urged people to tell politicians and business tycoons that it was electorally and financially safe to increase vaccine coverage in poorer nations.
“There’s probably 20 people in the world that are crucial to solving this equity problem,” he told a WHO social media live interaction.
“They head the big companies that are in charge of this; they head the countries that are contracting most of the world’s vaccines, and they head the countries that produce them.
“We need those 20 people to say, ‘we’re going to solve this problem by the end of September. We’re going to make sure that 10 percent of every country is vaccinated’.” Nearly 4.5 billion vaccine doses have been administered around the world, according to a count.
In high-income countries, as categorised by the World Bank, 104 doses have been injected per 100 people.
In the 29 lowest-income nations, just two doses have been administered per 100 people.
“We should be collectively disgusted with ourselves,” said Aylward.
“I can’t help but think: if we had tried to withhold vaccines from parts of the world, could we have made it any worse than it is today? 
The WHO wants every country to have vaccinated at least 10 percent of its population by the end of September; at least 40 percent by the end of this year, and 70 percent by the middle of 2022.
Last week, the WHO called for a moratorium on Covid-19 vaccine booster shots to address the drastic inequity in dose distribution — though several wealthy countries are going ahead regardless.
The WHO says there is no convincing picture as to whether boosters are actually necessary, given the level of protection offered by the WHO-authorised vaccines.",Newspaper
"Chinese court upholds Canadian’s death sentence as Huawei executive fights extradition
","August 11, 2021","BEIJING: A Chinese court upheld on Tuesday a Can­adian man’s death sentence for drug smuggling, a day before another court is due to rule on the case of another Canadian accused of spying.
The court proceedings for the two Canadians come as lawyers in Canada representing the detained chief financial officer of Chinese telecoms giant Huawei make a final push to convince a court there not to extradite her to the United States, where she faces charges linked to violating sanctions.
Robert Schellenberg was arrested in China in 2014 for suspected drug smuggling, convicted in 2018 and jailed for 15 years.
He appealed but a court in the city of Dalian then sentenced him to death in January 2019 — a month after Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou was arrested at Vancouver International Airport on a warrant from the United States.
She was charged with misleading HSBC Holdings PLC about Huawei’s business dealings in Iran, potentially causing the bank to violate American economic sanctions against Tehran.
Meng, who has said she is innocent, has been fighting her extradition from under house arrest in Vancouver.
The High Court in the northeastern Chinese province of Liaoning heard Schellenberg’s appeal against the death sentence in May last year and confirmed the verdict on Tuesday.
Speaking to reporters by telephone after attending the hearing, Canada’s ambassador to China, Dominic Barton, condemned the decision and called for China to grant clemency.
“It is not a coincidence that these are happening right now, while the case is going on in Vancouver,” Barton said, referring to Schelle­nb­erg’s case and that of another Canadian, Michael Spavor.
China has rejected the suggestion that the cases of the Canadians in China are linked to Meng’s case in Canada though Beijing has warned of unspecified consequences unless Meng was released.
“Schellenberg’s case is of a completely different nature from Meng’s case. Those who link the two together have ulterior motives,” a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Tuesday.
The spokesperson also said the facts were clear in Schellenberg’s case, the evidence  “solid and robust” and the  “sentencing procedures are lawful”.
An European Union spokes­person expressed concern on Tuesday about due process in China and the  “arbitrariness” of the case, and called for clemency for Schellenberg.
Separately, businessman Spavor was detained in China days after Meng’s arrest in Vancouver. He was charged with espionage in June last year and went to trial in March.
Barton said a court in the northeastern city of Dandong, on a river bordering North Korea, is expected to announce a verdict on Spavor on Wednesday.
A third Canadian, former diplomat Michael Kovrig, was also arrested in China days after Meng’s arrest and charged with espionage. His trial was conducted in March. A verdict has not yet been reported. Chinese courts have a conviction rate of more than 99pc.",Newspaper

The lawyers’ leaders closed the entrances to the Sindh High Court, City Courts and Malir District Courts to dissuade their colleagues from appearing before the courts to plead their cases fixed for the day. 
They also barred a large number of litigants from entering the courts’ premises, forcing them to return without attending the hearings of their cases. 
Only the courts’ staffers were allowed access to the courtrooms. 
At the SHC, lawyers holding placards chanted slogans against ignoring the seniority principle in elevation of high court judges to the Supreme Court and proposed ad hoc appointment of CJ Shaikh. 
The absence of litigants and their counsel forced benches to discharge their boards and defer the cases fixed before them. 
In the subordinate judiciary, the undertrial prisoners had to be taken back to the barracks without production before the courts. 
The members of the Sindh High Court Bar Association, Karachi Bar Association and Malir District Bar Association gathered in the offices of the bar associations to discuss the issue of elevation of a junior judge of the high court to the apex court.
Speaking to the media, SHCBA president Salahuddin Ahmed reiterated the bar associations’ contention that the principle of seniority be followed in elevation and appointment of judges to the SC in letter and spirit. 
He said at present there seemed to be no fixed criterion for the elevation of judges to the country’s top court, adding that the same should be evolved and all the stakeholders, particularly the bars across the country, as well as the principal law officers of the provincial and federal governments should also be taken on board in this regard. 
Barrister Ahmed said that the procedure being currently adopted by the Judicial Commission of Pakistan for the elevation of the high courts’ judges to the SC would create distrust among judges of the superior judiciary about one another, besides tarnishing the image of the institution of the judiciary in the public and negatively impacting its functioning.

"Ban imposed on several clerics in Islamabad to ensure peace in Muharram
","August 11, 2021","			
ISLAMABAD: The district administration has banned the entry of several ulema and zakirs in the capital to maintain peace in Muharram during which over 1,000 processions and majalis are scheduled to be held in the city. Besides, activities of some local ulema have also been restricted.
Officials of the administration and police said 181 processions were scheduled in the capital from Muharram 6 to Safar 19. Out of these, 14 processions have been put in category ‘A’, 95 in category ‘B’ and 72 in category ‘C’.
The category ‘A’ processions will be taken out in the limits of the I-9, Sabzi Mandi, Aabpara, Karachi Company, Golra, Secretariat and Khanna police.
Likewise, 122 of the 965 majalis have been put in category ‘A’, 418 in category ‘B’ and 425 in category ‘C’.
Deputy Commissioner Mohammad Hamza Shafqaat issued orders to limit the activities of several ulema on the basis of reports filed by the Special Branch. These local clerics were likely to deliver provocative speeches/sermons to create hatred among various religious sects.
“In the current security environment of the capital coupled with the threat perception of terrorism, it is apprehended that any breach in law and order due to sectarian violence may be used by terrorists as an opportunity to achieve their objectives,” said a notification.
The DC directed that the ulema and zakirs whose entry had been banned in the capital would not enter, reside or remain in the capital territory for a period of two months from the date of the issuance of the order. According to the Special Branch report, these clerics were habitual of making inflammatory/objectionable and fiery speeches on sectarian issues.
They may deliver sectarian/fiery speeches in the capital, thereby creating ill will and hatred among various sects. Their utterances are likely to ignite tension already existing among various religious sects of the district, which may result in loss to public life and property and may also create a law and order situation, it added.
Meanwhile, Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Dr Syed Mustafa Tanweer said the police had made a comprehensive security plan to maintain high vigilance in the city. He said flag marches were being conducted in various areas to make security more effective. He said strict vigilance would be maintained like the previous years to maintain law and order in the city.
The capital police headed by Additional SP Farhat Abbas Kazmi conducted a flag march with an objective to maintain peace in Muharram.
The flag march started from Pakistan Sports Complex and culminated at the same point after passing through various areas.
Rangers and other law enforcement agencies also participated in the flag march.
Meanwhile, all police officers have been asked to maintain close liaison with the peace committees and organisers of majalis and processions. The SSP said cooperation of the organisers would be ensured with the police and law enforcing officials.
He directed all police officers to ensure strict security arrangements on these occasions and special checking of the participants.
He said arrangements should be made for checking the participants of majalis and processions by using metal detectors. Strict vigilance should be maintained to ensure that security measures are in place by the police as well as the peace committees.
He said it would be ensured that processions passed through the fixed routes following the set timings. He also directed for effective patrolling and use of commando vehicles for the purpose.",Pakistan
"Kane Williamson among top NZ players to skip Bangladesh, Pakistan tours
","August 11, 2021","WELLINGTON: Black Caps captain Kane Williamson and several other senior players were on Tuesday excluded from upcoming tours to Bangladesh and Pakistan as New Zealand focus on the Twenty20 World Cup.
New Zealand confirmed their World Cup line-up in an unprecedented 32-man white ball squad to handle a heavy workload over the next four months.
In addition to the World Cup and tours of Bangladesh and Pakistan, New Zealand also have a Test series in India with that squad to be named next month.
New Zealand Cricket chief executive David White said changing times demanded changing strategies, with player welfare and support one of professional sport’s biggest challenges, particularly in the current pandemic environment.
“The need to safeguard the well-being of our players and support staff is now very real, and we’ve endeavoured to do this by carefully managing their workloads over this [year’s] massive playing programme,” White said.
New Zealand players involved in this year’s prematurely suspended Indian Premier League would be allowed to re-join their franchises when it re-starts in September.
“It’s a pragmatic approach. We’ve always tried to be realistic about the IPL and this particular issue is very much a one-off, caused by a unique set of circumstances,” White said.
A separate squad captained by Tom Latham will head to Bangladesh and Pakistan for white-ball tours in September and October prior to the World Cup to manage player workloads amid taxing Covid-19 restrictions.
Ross Taylor was initially selected for the three One-day Internationals in Pakistan but, with the brief nature of the one-week series and the length of quarantine protocols, it was decided he would remain in New Zealand to prepare for the Indian Test tour.
All-rounder Mark Chapman and spin bowler Todd Astle were named in the 15-man Twenty20 World Cup squad, while Finn Allen and Colin de Grandhomme have missed out.
Astle joins fellow leg-spinner Ish Sodhi and left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner for the Oct 17-Nov 14 tournament in the United Arab Emirates and Oman where spin is expected to be important.
Adam Milne will travel with the Williamson-captained squad as a standby for frontline pacemen Trent Boult, Tim Southee, Kyle Jamieson and Lockie Ferguson.
New Zealand play in Group 2 at the World Cup with India, Pakistan, Afghanistan and two qualifiers.
The squad will travel to India for three T20 matches after the World Cup before a two-Test series.

"Biden says Afghan leaders must 'fight for their nation' as Taliban gains increase
","August 11, 2021","Taliban insurgents tightened their grip on captured Afghan territory on Tuesday, now 
, as US President Joe Biden urged the nation's leaders to fight for their homeland.
Pul-e-Khumri, capital of the northern province of Baghlan, fell to the Taliban on Tuesday evening, according to residents who reported Afghan security forces retreating towards the Kelagi desert, home to a large Afghan army base.
Pul-e-Khumri became the 
 to come under the control of the militants in about a week.
""Afghan leaders have to come together,"" Biden told reporters at the White House, saying the Afghan troops outnumber the Taliban and must want to fight. ""They've got to fight for themselves, fight for their nation.""
The US president said he does not regret his decision to withdraw, noting that Washington has spent more than $1 trillion over 20 years and lost thousands of troops. He said the United States continues to provide significant air support, food, equipment and salaries to Afghan forces.
In Kabul, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said he was seeking help from regional militias he has squabbled with for years. He appealed to civilians to defend Afghanistan's ""democratic fabric"".
In Aibak, a provincial capital between the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif and Kabul, Taliban fighters were moving into government buildings. Most government forces appeared to have withdrawn.
""The only way is self-imposed house arrest or to find a way to leave for Kabul,"" said tax officer Sher Mohamed Abbas, when asked about living conditions in Aibak.
""But then even Kabul is not a safe option anymore,"" said Abbas, who supports a family of nine.
The north for years was Afghanistan's most peaceful region, with only a minimal Taliban presence. The militants' strategy appears to be to take the north, and border crossings in the north, west and south, and then close in on Kabul.
The Taliban, battling to defeat the US-backed government and reimpose their strict interpretation of Islamic law with peace talks at an impasse, met little resistance as they swept into Aibak on Monday.
A spokesman for the group's political office told 
 TV on Tuesday that the group is committed to the negotiation path in Doha and does not want it to collapse.
Taliban forces now control 65pc of Afghanistan, threaten to take 11 provincial capitals and seek to deprive Kabul of its traditional support from national forces in the north, a senior European Union (EU) official said on Tuesday.
The government has withdrawn from hard-to-defend rural districts to focus on holding population centres. Officials have appealed for pressure on Pakistan to stop Taliban reinforcements and supplies flowing over the border. Pakistan denies backing the Taliban.
The United States has been carrying out some airstrikes to support government troops. Defence Department spokesman John Kirby said the strikes were having a ""kinetic"" effect on the Taliban, but acknowledged limitations.
""Nobody has suggested here that airstrikes are a panacea, that will solve all the problems of the conditions on the ground. We've never said that,"" Kirby said.
Taliban and government officials confirmed that the insurgents have 
 in recent days in the north, west and south.
Gulam Bahauddin Jailani, head of the national disaster authority, told 
 fighting was going on in 25 of 34 provinces and 60,000 families had been displaced over the past two months, with most seeking refuge in Kabul.
Six EU member states warned the bloc's executive against halting deportations of rejected Afghan asylum seekers arriving in Europe, fearing a possible replay of a 2015-16 crisis over the arrival of more than a million migrants, mainly from the Middle East. 
UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said reports of violations that could amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity were emerging, including ""deeply disturbing reports"" of the summary execution of surrendering government troops.
""People rightly fear that a seizure of power by the Taliban will erase the human rights gains of the past two decades,” Bachelet said.
The Taliban, ousted after the September 11 attacks on the United States, appeared to be in a position to advance from different directions on Mazar-i-Sharif. Its fall would deal a devastating blow to Ghani's government.
Atta Mohammad Noor, a northern militia commander, vowed there would be ""resistance until the last drop of my blood"".
Washington will complete the withdrawal of its forces this month in exchange for Taliban promises to prevent Afghanistan from being used for international terrorism. The Taliban promised not to attack foreign forces as they withdraw but did not agree to a ceasefire with the government.",World
"Cracks now ‘visible’ in PTI, PML-Q alliance: Firdous Ashiq Awan
","August 11, 2021","PTI leader Dr Firdous Ashiq Awan said on Wednesday that cracks were appearing in the ties between her party and the Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid (PML-Q) due to “personal actions” of the Punjab Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Pervez Elahi.
The ties between the PML-Q and the PTI, who have formed a coalition government in Punjab, have been making the headlines for a year after the former had reportedly blamed the ruling party for 
 it had made earlier. Amid sporadically recurring reports of rifts between the two parties, it was 
 in June this year that the matter was settled after the PTI had agreed to one of the PML-Q's demands of providing development funds to its MNAs.
Speaking on a 
 programme earlier today, Awan, while referring to a recent incident where she was denied entry to Punjab Assembly premises, said the move was a clear indication of the shrinking ties between the two parties.
On Aug 9, videos 
 on social media showed Awan being stopped by security personnel at the entrance of the provincial legislature. The officials showed her a list of guests who were allowed for PTI MPA Ahsan Saleem Baryar's oathtaking ceremony, from which her own name had been struck off. Subsequently, she left the premises.
“A few days ago, I facilitated enrollment of a son of vice president of PML-Q into PTI and then got him a ticket from PP-38. And if somebody leaves [Pervez Elahi’s] party, contests election from some other platform and manages to get elected … and if the MNA from the constituency is denied access to the provincial assembly, it is a clear indication of souring ties between the two allies,” said the PM’s former aide.
She said the “cracks have become visible due to personal actions of the speaker.”
The PTI leader added there were several such instances. “A bill related to journalists was recently tabled and approved on a private members’ day that later triggered protests from the journalists' community. Subsequently, I raised a voice that it was a private member’s bill and not the government’s”.
She further said that a message was sent to her later that the government was not bound to undertake legislation with her consent.
Speaking about her appointment as adviser to the Punjab chief minister, she said the prime minister and Saifullah Naizi had convinced her to go to the province “because of my requirement there”. 
“Despite losing the elections, I worked in the province for three years and as a result I emerged victorious from PP-38.”
She said competitors often pull their opponents' leg and it was a democratic way to make efforts for progress and “in case someone did that to me, I would hold no grudge against that person.”
The former adviser said Prime Minister Imran Khan, would assign her a new role if the party felt her services were required for the country and the province.
She said Punjab was a difficult battleground, adding that the PTI’s main rival party had set a different trend among the public and bureaucracy.
“Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar, who is an honest man, is not highlighting on media the public welfare works he has undertaken and anyone who doesn’t brag about and publicise their works fails to get prominence on media screens,” she explained.
She said she was the fifth information minister changed in the province and hoped her successor “plays his innings till last”, adding that the erstwhile office-holders perhaps failed to meet the expectations of the leadership.",Pakistan
"Messi sets sights on Champions League 'dream' after PSG unveiling
","August 11, 2021","Lionel Messi has set his sights on more Champions League glory after being unveiled as a Paris Saint-Germain player on Wednesday as hundreds of fans gathered outside the club's stadium hoping to see their new idol.
The 34-year-old Argentinian superstar was presented to media from all over the world at a news conference at the Parc des Princes after 
 the previous day and penning a two-year contract with the option of a third season.
PSG quickly emerged as the favourites to sign Messi following the shock of his 
 last week from Barcelona and he arrives eyeing a fifth Champions League, with the most recent of his four victories with his old club coming in 2015.
“I have said many times that my dream is to win another Champions League and I think I am in the ideal place to have that chance and to do it,” Messi told reporters inside a packed auditorium, with the audience including his wife Antonella, their children, and his father and agent, Jorge.
Messi and Barcelona were knocked out of the Champions League last season by PSG, who went on to reach the semi-finals following their run to the final in 2020.
“Sometimes you can have the best team in the world and not win. That's football,” Messi, who won 35 trophies in total with Barca, added as he prepares to team up with Neymar and Kylian Mbappe in Paris.
“We know how difficult the Champions League is but Paris know that too — they have come very close in recent years but it is a competition in which the best teams take part and the best team doesn't always win.” 
PSG are reportedly paying 35 million euros ($41 million) a year to Messi, who will wear the number 30 jersey — fans were already queueing up outside the club's different shops in the capital on Wednesday morning to buy the shirt with his name and number on the back.
Messi was given a hero's welcome when he arrived in Paris on Tuesday, greeting supporters at Le Bourget airport to the north of the city and waving from the balcony of the plush hotel where he is staying near the Champs Elysees.
On Wednesday, he appeared unfazed as he emerged, immaculately turned out, to talk to media, although he did seem slightly uneasy at times, not least when one member of the audience started chanting his name.
Unlike when Zlatan Ibrahimovic signed for PSG in 2012, there was no glitzy unveiling in front of the Eiffel Tower, but Messi was photographed on the pitch before greeting the supporters who had waited at the stadium entrance, watching his press conference on a big screen.
“I'm very proud to present Leo Messi as a PSG player,” said Nasser al-Khelaifi, the president of the Qatar-owned outfit. “It is an amazing and historic day for the club, for the football world.” 
Messi made no secret of his sadness at leaving Barca, the only club he has so far represented in his 17-year professional career, as he gave a tearful news conference at the Camp Nou last weekend.
			
However, on Wednesday he said he was looking forward to getting started in his new home.
“Everyone knows that my departure from Barca was very hard because I spent so many years there, but as soon as I arrived here I felt enormously happy,” said the player who scored 672 goals in 778 games for the Catalans.
“Now I can't wait to start training.” 
			
Messi has had no pre-season having been on holiday since winning the Copa America with Argentina a month ago.
He is therefore unlikely to make his debut for PSG any time soon, and certainly not this weekend when Mauricio Pochettino's team play Strasbourg at home in Ligue 1.
PSG are now even more obvious favourites to run away with the French title, a trophy they missed out on last season to Lille.
However, despite concerns about a lack of competitive balance, French League president Vincent Labrune hailed the arrival of the six-time Ballon d'Or winner as “extraordinary news for the exposure of Ligue 1 internationally”.
“The arrival of Lionel Messi will increase the attractiveness and visibility of our league on all continents,” he said.
Attention, though, will now turn to the future of 22-year-old Mbappe, who has just a year left on his contract and has been strongly linked to Real Madrid.
“Kylian is a Parisian, he's very competitive. He said he wanted a competitive team,” Al-Khelaifi said.
“Now there's no one more competitive than us. He has no reason to do anything else,” other than stay, he added.",World
"Hanjarwal girls' kidnapping case: Police add sections related to rape in FIR
","August 11, 2021","Lahore police informed a judicial magistrate on Wednesday that they had added sections related to rape in the first information report (FIR) registered against five suspects in the 
 of four girls of Hanjarwal.
In an application submitted to Judicial Magistrate Ayyaz Rafique Lone, police said they suspected that one of the girls had been subjected to rape. Therefore, sections 376 (punishment for rape) and 377 (punishment for unnatural offences) of the Pakistan Penal Code were added to the FIR, they said.
The investigating officer requested the magistrate for an extension in the suspects' physical remand so their DNA tests could be conducted in order to complete the investigation. In his order, the magistrate said the police's request was ""plausible"" and extended the physical remand of the five suspects for three days.
He directed police to produce the suspects again on August 14.
The four girls, aged between eight and 14, had gone missing in Lahore on July 30. An FIR was subsequently registered on the complaint of the father of two of the girls. 
Complainant Irfan Ali of Mohalla Nambardaran had stated in the FIR that his daughters — aged 10 and 11 — along with the daughters of his neighbour Akram — aged 14 and eight — might have been kidnapped by some unknown persons.
A joint team of Sahiwal district police and the Crime Investigation Agency had 
 in a raid on a house in Sahiwal on Aug 4 and arrested the suspects — Qasim Ali, Shahzad and his wife, Naeem Shahzad, Asif and his wife, and Shaukat Ali. 
On Friday, the magistrate had allowed the recovered girls to go with their families.
An 
 submitted to a district court in Lahore earlier this month stated that one of the suspects, Qasim, had allegedly kidnapped the girls from Lahore and brought them to Sahiwal where they were received by Naeem Shahzad.
Naeem Shahzad used to teach dancing to girls and sent them to dance parties, according to the report.
Another suspect, Shahzad, was involved in prostitution along with his wife and already had a case registered against him for the crime in Sahiwal, the report said. It added that he owned one house in Lahore and three in Sahiwal.
The report said that the wife of another suspect, Asif, ran her own beauty parlour and was also engaged in prostitution, providing the services of girls through the parlour.
The court had remanded the five men to police custody and sent the two women to jail on judicial remand for 14 days.",Pakistan
"Opposition asks govt to brief parliament on Afghan situation
","August 16, 2021","• Calls for developing national consensus to deal with consequences of Taliban rule

• Formation of parliamentary national security committee urged    
ISLAMABAD: The country’s two major opposition parties — the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) — have again asked the government to brief parliament on the current situation in Afghanistan, come up with a policy statement and develop a national consensus to deal with the possible consequences the nation can face after the establishment of Taliban rule in the war-torn country. 
The leaders of the two parties, while talking to 
, regretted that they had been demanding the sessions of the National Assembly and the Senate or a joint sitting of the two houses of parliament for the last couple of months, but so far the government had not given any serious thought to their demand.
The PPP has already convened an extraordinary meeting of its Central Executive Committee (CEC) at Bilawal House in Karachi on Monday (today) to discuss the situation in Afghanistan and formulate the party’s point of view on it. 
Talking to 
, PPP secretary general Farhatullah Babar said the party had convened the CEC meeting a couple of days ago and now the situation in Afghanistan had entirely changed after reports that President Ashraf Ghani had fled the country. He said the party’s formal position and statement on the situation would come out after the CEC meeting on Monday.
Mr Babar was of the view that they could not debate the Doha Agreement and now they were required to discuss “what next”. He said the party would hold a thorough and an open debate on the issue in the CEC meeting which would also be attended by former president Asif Ali Zardari via video link. 
Earlier, in a statement, PPP Senator Raza Rabbani said the situation in Afghanistan was maturing on an hour-to-hour basis and Pakistan would have to take far-reaching decisions that would require a national consensus, but the opposition had not been taken into confidence. 
At this critical time, he said, the Senate and the National Assembly, separately, needed to be in session and briefed by the government on a daily basis. He suggested that a joint sitting of parliament should elect a parliamentary committee on national security having equal membership of the opposition and treasury members to formulate a future plan of action.
Mr Rabbani, who had also served as the Senate chairman, said the committee should be tasked with discussing “the Afghan situation and its regional consequences, the question of recognition of Taliban government in Kabul, the escalation of the intra-Afghan conflict into a civil war and its impact on Pakistan’s internal security, the policy Pakistan needs to adopt in order to contain religious extremism and terrorism within, Pakistan’s policy with reference to internally displaced persons in the eventuality of a civil war in Afghanistan and to discuss the diplomatic initiatives required to stop the world from pointing a finger at Pakistan”. 
Meanwhile, a senior PPP member and party office-bearer, while talking to 
, said the party believed that the proceedings of the proposed joint sitting of parliament should not be held in-camera so that the nation could see and analyse the positions taken by various parties. He said the nation should know as to which were the parties celebrating Taliban takeover of Kabul as there were reports that the activists of some religious parties had distributed sweets over the Taliban rule in Afghanistan. 
Talking to 
, PML-N senior vice-president and former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi said that in-house consultations were already going on within the party over the events unfolding in Afghanistan. 
He said the PML-N was of the view that Pakistan should not become a party in Afghanistan’s internal issues and they should respect the verdict of the people of Afghanistan.  He said the party’s supreme leader Nawaz Sharif was also a part of these consultations. 
Mr Abbasi said the government should brief the opposition and parliamentarians on its policy on the Afghan situation. He was of the view that a mere debate in the joint sitting of parliament would be of no use. 
He said the focus of the debate should be the development of a national consensus. However, he said, the debate would only be meaningful if it was held after the issuance of a policy statement from the government.
Mr Abbasi said that Pakistan should make an effort to prevent bloodshed and civil war in the neighbouring country. He said it would be important to see as to how the Qatar declaration would be implemented as Pakistan was also a part of it. He said it had been decided in Qatar that they would not recognise any government taken over by force. 
The former prime minister said the PML-N believed that the two countries should respect each other’s sovereignty.",Pakistan
"Son scores winner as Kane-less Spurs stun City
","August 16, 2021","LONDON: Son Heung-min proved there is life at Tottenham Hotspur without Harry Kane as his goal earned the north London club a surprise 1-0 win over champions Manchester City in an absorbing Premier League opener on Sunday.   
All the talk beforehand was whether Tottenham’s talisman Kane, strongly linked with a move to City, would be involved.   
The England skipper was left out of the squad, having only just returned to training, but it was his usual strike partner Son who gave Tottenham’s new manager Nuno Espirito Santo a perfect start to his reign as City showed why they are in need of a natural goal-scorer in a toothless display.   
Kane has reportedly told Spurs he wants to leave, with City manager Pep Guardiola previously acknowledging that his club is very interested in buying him.  
City dominated possession but struggled to break down a disciplined Spurs side, which was content to sit back and wait for opportunities to counter.  
City’s record signing Jack Grealish showed early flashes of his abilities breaking forward in the opening minutes to draw a free kick just outside the area but missed his best chance to score when his shot from a tight angle was easily saved by Hugo Lloris in the 75th.  
Riyad Mahrez had City’s best chance of the game in the 35th when he met a cross from Raheem Sterling but shot wide after failing to cleanly connect with the ball.  
Son had already threatened on a couple of counters by the time he put Spurs ahead in the 55th. The South Korea international collected the ball down the right flank, drove at defender Nathan Ake and then cut inside to bend a low shot inside the far post.  
Steven Bergwijn had a great chance to double the lead on another counterattack just before the hour mark, but shot wide.  
City have now lost their last three competitive games 1-0 after defeats in the Champions League final last season to Chelsea and Leicester in last weekend’s Community Shield. 
Guardiola’s men should only get stronger with the return of many internationals and possibly Kane. 
However, they have already ceded ground to Chelsea, Manchester United and Liverpool, who all displayed their title credentials with convincing wins on Saturday. 
  
Earlier on Sunday, West Ham United forward Michail Antonio missed a penalty before scoring with a thundering shot as the Londoners came from behind to outclass Newcastle United 4-2 in a in a crowd-pleasing game in front of a full St James Park.   
Antonio collected Said Benrahma’s neat pass and blasted one past Freddie Woodman to make it 4-2, shortly after the debutant goalkeeper palmed away the forward’s poor spot kick only for Tomas Soucek to pounce on the rebound to put West Ham ahead.  
Antonio’s strike made him West Ham’s joint-top scorer in the Premier League alongside Italian Paolo Di Canio on 47 goals and he nearly added to his tally only to be denied by the post. Benrahma had earlier made it 2-2 with a header to put West Ham on course for a victory which seemed unlikely after they had conceded in the fifth minute to Callum Wilson.   
Roared on by the Magpies’ first capacity home crowd for 17 months, Newcastle started brightly as Callum Wilson headed home Allan Saint-Maximin’s teasing delivery.   
An intended cross by Aaron Cresswell crept in to quickly get West Ham level before Jacob Murphy’s header restored Newcastle’s lead at half-time.   
But Murphy went from hero to villain later in the game as he fouled Pablo Fornals to concede the penalty that led to West Ham’s revival.  
It made for a promising start for David Moyes’ West Ham, who finished a surprising sixth last season. 
“It was a really good game, if you were a neutral you would have said it was a good game of football, plenty of action at both ends,” Moyes said. “I thought we had good control of the game at different times, we kept the ball well, at times we had to suffer a bit when we didn’t have the ball.”  
 
In Saturday’s late match, Liverpool — with key defender Virgil van Dijk back after a nine-month absence — eased to a 3-0 win at promoted Norwich City.    
Mohamed Salah set up two goals before scoring himself — the fifth straight season he has netted in the opening round.    
Diogo Jota and the player who replaced him in the 61st minute, Roberto Firmino, scored from passes from Salah before the latter curled a shot high into the net for a record-breaking strike.    
Van Dijk, whose ACL injury was a big factor in Liverpool’s mediocre defence of their title last season, had a comfortable return as his team brushed Norwich aside.   
“It’s amazing if I’m honest,” said Van Dijk on his return. “I need games; the manager knows it, I know it, but it was a good start today and hopefully I’m ready for next week.”",Newspaper
"US to recognise Taliban only if they respect basic rights, says Blinken
","August 16, 2021","WASINGTON: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Sunday that the United States will only recognise a future government in Afghanistan if it upholds basic rights of its people and keeps terrorists out of the country.
Asked to comment on media reports that China was ready to recognise the Taliban as a legitimate government, Secretary Blinken said: “A future Afghan government that upholds the basic rights of its people and that doesn’t harbor terrorists is a government we can work with and recognise.”
Conversely, he added, “a government that doesn’t uphold the basic rights of its people, including women and girls; that harbors terrorist groups that have designs on the United States or allies and partners — certainly, that’s not going to happen.”
The top American diplomat appeared on a number of US television channels on Sunday to comment on the developments in Afghanistan where Taliban insurgents have entered Kabul, forcing President Ashraf Ghani to seek refuge in Tajikistan.
: 
He warned that international assistance to a Taliban-led government in Kabul “will not be forthcoming, sanctions will not be lifted and their ability to travel won’t happen” if they did not respect basic rights and did not stop harboring terrorists.
When the interviewer argued that his statement sounded like a no to recognition, Mr Blinken said: “It’s incumbent on the international community, including the United States, to do everything we can using every tool that we have — economic, diplomatic, political — to ensure (those) rights are sustained.”
He also emphasised the need to ensure that “if the Taliban does not do that … it clearly faces the penalties for not upholding those rights,” adding “We will do everything we can to make sure that’s the case.”
 Jake Tapper reminded Mr Blinken that in a recent statement, US President Joe Biden had insisted that the Kabul government would not fall and asked him how the president could “get this so wrong.”
The secretary argued that the US had accomplished its goals in Afghanistan, by dealing with the folks who attacked us on 9/11, eliminating Osama bin Laden in 2011 and diminishing the threat from Al Qaeda and now was the time to leave.
Quoting a former US ambassador to Afghanistan, Ryan Crocker, that the withdrawal of US troops was “a handover to the Taliban” that left the Afghan people “hung… out to dry,” the journalist asked: “Does President Biden not bear the blame for this disastrous exit from Afghanistan?”
Mr Blinken replied, “We have said all along, including the president, that the Taliban was at its greatest position of strength at any time since 2001 when it was last in charge of [Afghanistan].
That is the Taliban that we inherited. And so, we saw that they are very much capable of going on the offensive and beginning to take back the country.”
He pointed out that the US spent billions of dollars, “building a modern military with sophisticated equipment, 300,000 forces strong, with an air force that the Taliban didn’t have. And the fact of the matter is, we have seen that that force has been unable to defend the country.”
Secretary Blinken also rejected the suggestion that sending American troops to evacuate US Embassy staff and other Americans resembled the hasty US evacuation from Vietnam.
“Remember, this is not Saigon,” he said. “We went to Afghanistan 20 years ago with one mission. And that mission was to deal with the folks who attacked us on 9/11. And we have succeeded in that mission.”",Newspaper

"PM officially launches single national curriculum today
","August 16, 2021","ISLAMABAD: Terming the Single National Curriculum (SNC) a milestone to end disparity in the education system, Federal Education Minister Shafqat Mahmood said on Sunday Prime Minister Imran Khan will officially launch the SNC on Monday (today).
Addressing a press conference at the Press Information Department (PID), the minister said that except Sindh the SNC had been launched from class I to 5 in public, private schools and seminaries.
“We are hopeful Sindh too will adopt SNC at a later stage. I will hold meetings with the education minister and the chief minister of Sindh soon,” he said. It is for the first time in the history of the country that the SNC has been prepared, which is indeed a great achievement of the PTI government, he said.
“Monday is going to be a highly auspicious day for the country as the prime minister will officially launch the SNC,” Mr Mahmood said, adding that all private, public schools and seminaries were bound to teach SNC-based books, which were available in markets.
Besides government publishers, private publishers have also been issued non-objection certificates for publishing the books.
He said that there are some challenges for proper implementation of SNC as new initiatives always face some resistance, adding that the government will overcome all the challenges.
The minister warned that action will be taken against those private schools which will not adopt the SNC-based books. He, however, said private schools and seminaries can teach students extra material/books of their choice but they can’t avoid the SNC-based books. The government is also mulling conducting special exams of class fifth in coming years to check implementations of the SNC.
He said that from next year the SNC would be introduced from class six to eight and then in 2023 from class nine to 12.
He said many challenges, which the country was facing, were a result of the disparity in the education system as a small group of students who got education in upscale schools got maximum chances of excelling while majority of students of public schools had no opportunity to shine because of the different education system.
The SNC, besides covering other aspects, also emphasised character building of students, promoting tolerance, nationalism, civic responsibilities etc. He said under the SNC Muslim students will be taught Nazra as a compulsory subject while they will also be taught about the life of the holy Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).
Similarly, the minister said, for the first time students of five sects of minorities will be taught books of their sects. To a query, the minister said he would ensure that there is no shortage of books in the markets. He said compared to others the SNC books were very cheap.",Pakistan

"Death toll of powerful earthquake in Haiti soars to 1,297
","August 16, 2021","The death toll from a 
 in Haiti climbed to 1,297 on Sunday, a day after the powerful temblor turned thousands of structures into rubble and set off frantic rescue efforts ahead of a potential deluge from an approaching storm.
Saturday’s earthquake also left at least 5,700 people injured in the Caribbean nation, with thousands more displaced from their destroyed or damaged homes. Survivors in some areas were forced to wait out in the open amid oppressive heat for help from overloaded hospitals.
The devastation could soon worsen with the coming of tropical depression Grace, which is predicted to reach Haiti on Monday (today) night. The US National Hurricane Centre warned that although Grace had weakened from tropical storm strength on Sunday, it still posed a threat to bring heavy rain, flooding and landslides.
The earthquake struck the southwestern part of the hemisphere’s poorest nation, almost razing some towns and triggering landslides that hampered rescue efforts in a country already struggling with the coronavirus pandemic, a presidential assassination and a wave of gang violence.
The epicenter was about 125 kilometres west of the capital of Port-au-Prince, the US Geological Survey said, and aftershocks continued to jolt the area on Sunday.
In the badly damaged coastal town of Les Cayes, Jennie Auguste lay on a flimsy foam mattress on the tarmac of the community’s tiny airport waiting for anything — space at a hospital or a small plane like the ones ferrying the wounded to the capital. She suffered injuries in the chest, abdomen and arm when the roof collapsed at the store where she worked.
“There has been nothing. No help, nothing from the government,” Auguste’s sister, Bertrande, said.
In scenes widespread across the region hit by the quake, families salvaged their few belongings and spent the night at an open-air football pitch. On Sunday, people lined up to buy what little was available: bananas, avocados and water at a local street market.
Some in the town praised God for surviving the earthquake, and many went to the cathedral, which appeared outwardly undamaged even if the priests’ residence was destroyed.
“We only have Jesus now,” said Johanne Dorcely, whose house was destroyed. “If it wasn’t for Jesus, I wouldn’t be able to be here today.”
Workers tore through the rubble of collapsed buildings with heavy machinery, shovels and picks. After sundown, Les Cayes was darkened by intermittent blackouts and many people slept outside again, clutching small transistor radios tuned to news, terrified of a possible repetition of Saturday’s strong aftershocks.
Prime Minister Ariel Henry has declared a one-month state of emergency for the whole country and said he was rushing aid to areas where towns were destroyed and hospitals were overwhelmed.
“The first convoys started following the coordination efforts of several ministers mobilised at the level of the National Emergency Centre,” Henry told reporters on Sunday. “We salute the dignity, the resilience effort of the victims and their ability to start over. From my observations, I deduce that Haitians want to live and progress. Let us unite to offer these people a living environment conducive to development.”
United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef) Executive Director Henrietta Fore said on Sunday that humanitarian needs are acute, with many Haitians urgently needing healthcare, clean water and shelter. Children who have been separated from parents need protection, she said.
“Little more than a decade on, Haiti is reeling once again,” Fore said in a statement. “And this disaster coincides with political instability, rising gang violence, alarmingly high rates of malnutrition among children, and the Covid-19 pandemic — for which Haiti has received just 500,000 vaccine doses, despite requiring far more.”
The country of 11 million people received its first batch of US-donated coronavirus vaccines only last month via a UN program for low-income countries.
Haiti’s Office of Civil Protection said more than 7,000 homes were destroyed and nearly 5,000 damaged. Hospitals, schools, offices and churches were also affected.
Medical workers from across the region were scrambling to help as hospitals in Les Cayes started running out of space to perform surgeries.
“Basically, they need everything,” said Dr Inobert Pierre, a pediatrician with the nonprofit Health Equity International, which oversees St Boniface Hospital, about two hours from Les Cayes.
“Many of the patients have open wounds and they have been exposed to not-so-clean elements,” added Pierre, who visited two hospitals in Les Cayes — one with some 200 patients, the other with around 90. “We anticipate a lot of infections.”
Pierre’s medical team was taking some patients to St Boniface to undergo surgery, but with just two ambulances, they could transport only four at a time.
Small planes from a private firm and the Florida-based missionary service Agape Flights landed at the Port-Au-Prince airport on Sunday, carrying about a half dozen injured from the Les Cayes area. Young men with bandages and a woman were hoisted on stretchers to waiting Haitian Red Cross ambulances.
Silvestre Plaza Rico, who was supervising one of the volunteer flights, said rescue planes had made several airlifts of about half dozen injured victims each on Saturday. “There were many, many, many, from different towns,” Plaza Rico said.
The earthquake struck just over a month after President Jovenel Moïse was 
 in his home, sending the country into political chaos. His widow, Martine Moïse, who was seriously wounded in the attack, posted a message on Twitter calling for unity among Haitians: “Let’s put our shoulders together to bring solidarity.”
Shortly after the earthquake, Henry said he wanted “structured solidarity” to ensure the response was coordinated to avoid the confusion that followed the devastating 2010 earthquake, when aid was slow to reach residents.
US President Joe Biden named US Agency for International Development (USAID) Administrator Samantha Power to oversee the US effort to help Haiti. She announced on Sunday that USAID was sending a search and rescue team from Virginia at the request of Haiti’s government. The 65-person team will bring specialised tools and medical supplies, she said on Twitter.
			
Working with USAID, the US Coast Guard said a helicopter was transporting medical personnel from the Haitian capital to the quake zone and evacuating the injured back to Port-au-Prince. Lt Commander Jason Nieman, a spokesperson, said another helicopter was being sent from the Bahamas, along with other aircraft and ships.
Already on the scene were several members of Cuba’s 253-member healthcare mission to Haiti, and the socialist nation’s state media showed photos of them giving first aid to victims injured by the quake.
The North Carolina-based aid group Samaritan’s Purse announced it would fly 13 disaster response specialists and 31 tons of emergency supplies to Haiti. These include shelter materials and water filtration units.
Humanitarian workers said gang activity in the seaside district of Martissant, just west of the Haitian capital, was complicating relief efforts.
The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said Haiti’s southern peninsula is a “hotspot for gang-related violence,” where humanitarian workers have been repeatedly attacked.
The agency said the area has been “virtually unreachable” over the past two months because of roadblocks and security concerns. But it said late on Sunday that local officials negotiated with gangs in the seaside district of Martissant to allow two humanitarian convoys a day to pass through the area.
Anna Jefferys, spokesperson for the UN agency, said the first convoy passed through Sunday with government and UN personnel. The UN’s World Food Program plans to send food supplies via trucks to southern Haiti on Tuesday, she added.
Haiti, where many live in tenuous circumstances, is vulnerable to earthquakes and hurricanes. A magnitude 5.9 earthquake in 2018 killed more than a dozen people.
The magnitude 7.0 quake of 2010 hit closer to densely populated Port-au-Prince and caused widespread destruction. Haiti’s government put the death toll at more than 300,000, while a report commissioned by the US government placed it between 46,000 and 85,000.",World
"China says ready for 'friendly relations' with Taliban after Kabul takeover
","August 16, 2021","China is ready to deepen “friendly and cooperative” relations with Afghanistan, a government spokeswoman said on Monday, after the Taliban seized control of the country.
Beijing has sought to maintain unofficial ties with the Taliban throughout the US' withdrawal from Afghanistan, which spurred an advance by the hardliners across the country that saw them 
 on Sunday.
China shares a rugged 76-kilometre border with Afghanistan.
Beijing has long feared Afghanistan could become a staging point for minority Uyghur separatists in the sensitive border region of Xinjiang.
But a top-level Taliban delegation 
 with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Tianjin last month, promising that Afghanistan would not be used as a base for militants.
In exchange, China offered economic support and investment for Afghanistan's reconstruction.
On Monday, China said it “welcomed” the chance to deepen ties with Afghanistan, a country that has for generations been coveted for its geo-strategic importance by bigger powers.
“The Taliban have repeatedly expressed their hope to develop good relations with China, and that they look forward to China's participation in the reconstruction and development of Afghanistan,” foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters.
“We welcome this. China respects the right of the Afghan people to independently determine their own destiny and is willing to continue to develop ... friendly and cooperative relations with Afghanistan.” 
Hua called on the Taliban to “ensure a smooth transition” of power and keep its promises to negotiate the establishment of an “open and inclusive Islamic government” and ensure the safety of Afghans and foreign citizens.
China's embassy in Kabul remains operational, Hua said, although Beijing began evacuating Chinese citizens from the country months ago amid the deteriorating security situation.
In a statement on Monday, the embassy told Chinese citizens remaining in Afghanistan to “pay close attention to the security situation” and stay indoors.
US President Joe Biden promised a complete withdrawal of US troops by September 11, marking an end to two decades of war.
But Washington was 
 by the rapid collapse of the Afghan government and the Taliban's sweeping advance.
China has repeatedly criticised what it sees as the US' hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan as a failure of leadership.
The Taliban's takeover opens a strategic door to China laden with both risk and opportunity.
Maintaining stability after decades of war in its western neighbour will be Beijing's main consideration, as it seeks to secure its borders and strategic infrastructure investments in Pakistan.
For Beijing, a stable and cooperative administration in Kabul would pave the way for an expansion of its Belt and Road Initiative into Afghanistan and through the Central Asian republics, analysts say.
The Taliban meanwhile may consider China a crucial source of investment and economic support.
China has so far stopped short of officially recognising the Taliban as the new leaders of Afghanistan, but Wang Yi called them a “decisive military and political force” during last month's meeting in Tianjin.",World
"US diplomats sent cable in mid-July warning of potential swift Taliban takeover: report
","August 20, 2021","About two dozen US diplomats in Afghanistan sent an internal cable last month warning US State Secretary Antony Blinken of the potential fall of Kabul to the Taliban as troops withdrew from the country, 
 
 on Thursday.
The newspaper said the confidential cable sent through a so-called dissent channel was signed on July 13 and offered recommendations on ways to mitigate the crisis and accelerate an evacuation.
The administration has been criticised for leaving efforts to get American diplomats and other citizens, as well Afghan allies, out of the country, until after a Taliban takeover was well under way.
: 
US officials declined to confirm specific details or share the contents of the cable.
“I think the cable reflects what we've said all along, which is nobody had this exactly right in predicting that the government and army of Afghanistan were going to collapse in a matter of days,” White House Deputy National Security Adviser Jonathan Finer told 
.
A source familiar with the situation said the US State Department took on board the concerns of those who drafted the cable, including by condemning the Taliban's atrocities ahead of the group 
 on Sunday.
US State Department spokesman Ned Price said diplomats' views shared with Blinken through the channel were incorporated into policy and planning.
“We value constructive internal dissent. It's patriotic. It's protected. And it makes us more effective,” Price said. ",World
"Pakistan to launch mobile app to 'support emotional health' of frontline Covid responders
","August 20, 2021","The Ministry of Planning, Development and Special Initiatives on Friday announced the launch of a mobile application to “protect emotional health of the front line responders as part of the Covid-19 response in the country"".
The mobile app 'MyCare+', will soon be launched under the Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) initiative, the ministry tweeted from its official Twitter account.
			
According to the ministry, the mobile application will help users in:
Earlier, the Ministry of Health Services, Regulation and Coordination, in collaboration with the World Health Organisation, had launched 
 — a campaign aimed at ""providing adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) to the health workers, orienting them on using various PPE items as per international standards, and creating an overall psycho-social environment of care and support,"" according to a statement on the ministry's website. 
Further, the campaign also aimed to ""sensitise the public, including patients and visitors at healthcare facilities, to supports frontline healthcare workers by following preventive behaviors to not only reduce the risk of infection to themselves but also reduce the work burden on and health risks for the health providers,"" the statement adds.
In July last year, a charitable organisation 'The Dawood Foundation' had 
 into a strategic partnership with the British Asian Trust to promote mental health support among frontline workers and the people directly affected by Covid-19 pandemic.
Under the Rs1 billion programme, outreach services were to be developed to provide mental health support and referral for frontline workers, patients screened and tested for Covid-19 through the Indus Health Network and other partner hospitals, and the people in general as well.
Meanwhile, the government also recently launched the 'Pak Covid-19 Vaccination Pass App', which will help identify fake vaccination certificates and also facilitate inoculated people in carrying their digital Covid-19 vaccination certificates.",Pakistan
"Pakistan has evacuated 1,100 people from Kabul, says UN envoy
","August 20, 2021","Pakistan has evacuated around 1,100 people — including diplomats, staff of diplomatic missions and international agencies, and journalists — from Kabul, Pakistan's Permanent Representative at the United Nations Ambassador Munir Akram said on Friday.
In an interview with 
 Isa Soares, he said that the situation in Afghanistan was ""challenging"". ""But our embassy is operating. They are processing all applicants [seeking] visas and those who want to utilise Pakistan as a transit point to leave Afghanistan.""
			
He said that Pakistan was flying three flights a day to Kabul airport so that between 500 to 600 people can be evacuated on a daily basis.
He added that Pakistan would also facilitate those wanting to enter Pakistan through the land border between the two countries, provided they have the necessary documentation.
""But at the moment, the focus has been on the airport which is under US control, and we are utilising that to take out as many people as possible,"" he said.
Meanwhile, federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Fawad Chaudhry said that Pakistan International Airlines had resumed its Kabul operations, adding that 350 passengers will arrive today (Friday).
""More flights are scheduled. Likewise the interior ministry is facilitating people arriving through the borders. Pakistan is at the forefront of helping Journalists and others caught up in the Afghan conflict,"" he wrote on Twitter.
More than 18,000 people have been flown out of Kabul since the Taliban took over Afghanistan's capital, a Nato official said on Friday, pledging to redouble evacuation efforts as criticism of the West's handling of the crisis mounted.
Thousands of people, desperate to flee the country, were still thronging the airport, the official who declined to be identified told 
, even though the Taliban have urged people without legal travel documents to go home.
The Taliban urged unity ahead of Friday prayers, the first since they seized power, calling on imams to persuade people not to leave Afghanistan amid the chaos at the airport, protests and reports of violence.
The US is struggling to pick up the pace of American and Afghan evacuations at Kabul airport, constrained by obstacles ranging from armed Taliban checkpoints to paperwork problems. 
With an August 31 deadline looming, tens of thousands remained to be airlifted from the country.
Taliban fighters and their checkpoints ringed the airport — major barriers for Afghans who fear that their past work with Westerners makes them prime targets for retribution.
Hundreds of Afghans who lacked any papers or clearance for evacuation also congregated outside the airport, adding to the chaos that has prevented even some Afghans who do have papers and promises of flights from getting through.
It didn’t help that many of the Taliban fighters could not read the documents.
In a hopeful sign, State Department spokesman Ned Price said in Washington that 6,000 people were cleared for evacuation on Thursday and were expected to board military flights in the coming hours.
That would mark a major increase from recent days. About 2,000 passengers were flown out on each of the past two days, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said.
Kirby said the military has aircraft available to evacuate 5,000 to 9,000 people per day, but until Thursday far fewer designated evacuees had been able to reach, and then enter, the airport.
Kirby told reporters the limiting factor has been available evacuees, not aircraft. He said efforts were underway to speed processing, including adding State Department consular officers to verify paperwork of Americans and Afghans who managed to get to the airport. Additional entry gates had been opened, he said.
And yet, at the current rate it would be difficult for the US to evacuate all of the Americans and Afghans who are qualified for and seeking evacuation by August 31.
On Wednesday, US President Joe Biden said he would ensure no American was left behind, even if that meant staying beyond August, an arbitrary deadline that he set weeks before the Taliban climaxed a stunning military victory by taking Kabul last weekend.
It was not clear if Biden might consider extending the deadline for evacuees who aren’t American citizens.",World

"Cabinet may approve draft bill to set up Pakistan Media Development Authority today
","August 24, 2021","ISLAMABAD: The federal cabinet is set to take up and approve on Tuesday (today) the draft bill for establishment of the Pakistan Media Development Authority (PMDA), sources in the government told 
.
The controversial bill has been strongly opposed by the owners of media houses and workers, but the information ministry has repeatedly expressed its resolve to establish the new authority.
The Digital Media Wing of the Ministry of Information on Monday issued a video footage of Minister for Information and Broadcasting Fawad Chaudhry with digital broadcasters, including YouTubers, where he said that declaration of around 50 percent of the newspapers in country would soon be cancelled.
He said the proposed authority would have the powers to impose a fine of up to Rs250 million for violations by the electronic media. He said internet-based entertainment channels would be bound to air at least 30pc Pakistani contents.
Minister of State for Information Farrukh Habib had attended an interactive session on August 12. Officials attached with several local news websites and seven YouTubers, including Siddiq Jan, Mohammad Imran, Abdul Qadir, Mughees Ali, Makhdoom Shahab and Umar Inam, also attended the session.
One YouTuber, who attended the meeting, said Mr Habib had highlighted the importance of the new authority and it was the need of time.
Mohammad Imran told 
 that the minister had informed the meeting that the last media-related law enacted in the country was the establishment of Pakistan Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) but that too was around 20 years ago, while the print media-related laws were made in the last century.
Another YouTuber said Mr Habib claimed that all stakeholders, including the media employees, had been consulted and slammed those opposing it.
Fawad Chaudhry pointed out that Pemra was a strong and updated organisation, but certain changes were needed in its powers and the new authority would impose a penalty of up to Rs250m on satellite channels for violations.
He said the PMDA would not have the powers to shut down any channel and there was no provision for criminal liability in the proposed law.
Mr Chaudhry said there would be three tiers of appeals against a decision of the proposed PMDA — the appellate commission, tribunal and Supreme court.
He said a development wing had been proposed to be established under the PMDA for capacity building of journalists.
The minister said a forum on the pattern of Implementation Tribunal for Newspaper Employees would be established for addressing the grievances of employees of the electronic media.
He said the Audit Bureau of Circulation had approved 1,672 newspapers but around 800 of them did not meet the requirements for their approval and their declarations would be cancelled soon.
Mr Chaudhry lauded the services of YouTubers and news websites for their in­­n­ovativeness and what he described as taking a leap into the future media. He said the government would facilitate the grow­­th of digital platforms and digital media.
He announced that registered YouTubers would be entitled to government advertisements under the PMDA.
The minister said that the new authority would encourage the local cinema industry and facilitate it, while the censor board would be replaced with ‘Board of Films Censor’.
He insisted that digital media would actually define the media landscape of Pakistan in future. “However, it doesn’t mean that formal media will vanish but the medium of communication will just change. Content is here to stay,” he added.
He said that currently there were seven laws regulating media in the country and all these laws would be replaced with the PMDA.
The proposed authority has already invited criticism from civil society, workers and representative bodies of media houses.
The All Pakistan Newspapers Society, Council of Pakistan Newspaper Editors, Pakistan Broadcasters Association, Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) and Association of Electronic Media Editors and News Directors have already rejected the proposed PMDA and termed the law behind it draconian.
The PFUJ has planned to stage a protest outside the Parliament House on the day when President Dr Arif Alvi will address the joint session of parliament.",Pakistan

A report placed by Inam Ghani, the Inspector General of Punjab, before the human rights cell of the Supreme Court stated that the committee would consist of Additional IG Sardar Ali Khan, DIG Muhammad Yousaf Malik and SSP Athar Ismail Amjad.
The human rights cell had solicited a report on the action taken so far by the provincial police over the incident.
According to the report, so far 30 videos had been collected and 60 still pictures generated from the videos had been sent to the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) for face recognition.
Nadra identified nine people as suspects in the episode. The Call Data Record (CDR) and intelligence from the crime scene corroborated the findings, according to the report.
The suspects were arrested and during interrogation they named some of their associates, who were arrested as well.
A total of 92 suspects have so far been taken into custody, the report explained, adding that all of them were interrogated and their role in the event was being ascertained.
Moreover, geo-fencing data has been obtained through coordination with intelligence agencies.
A total of 28,863 communication records were found in the Greater Iqbal Park from 6.30pm to 7.40pm on Aug 14 through geo-fencing. These records were subjected to rigorous analysis and so far 730 numbers have been isolated from the record for scrutiny.
Information about the suspects has also been obtained through Nadra’s verification service system (Verisys), according to the report.

"Survey finds ‘record improvement’ in business confidence in Pakistan
","August 24, 2021","KARACHI: Overall business confidence in Pakistan underwent “record improvement” in recent months, according to a survey conducted by the Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI).
The Business Confidence Index (BCI) Survey that the OICCI conducted across the country from May to July showed the overall Business Confidence Score (BCS) stood at nine per cent, up from minus 50pc in the preceding survey held in May 2020.
Prime Minister Imran Khan took to Twitter on Monday to share the survey results with his 14.1 million followers. “More good news on econ front… Dramatic rise in confidence of business especially foreign investors,” he tweeted.
			
Periodically conducted OICCI BCI Survey collects feedback from frontline business stakeholders on the environment and opportunities impacting their respective operations.
A positive BCI was last seen in April 2018.
The survey is done face to face and across the country in nine cities. It covers 80pc of GDP, with higher weights given to key business centres of Karachi, Lahore, Rawa­lpindi-Islamabad and Faisalabad.
The survey sample consisted of 40pc respondents from the manufacturing sector, 35pc from the services sector and 25pc from retailers and wholesalers. The growing confidence of the business community is driven by all the three sectors, with the first two recording an increase of 65 percentage points each – manufacturing from -48pc to 17pc and services from -59pc to 6pc. The retail/wholesale sector went up 44 percentage points from — 44pc to zero.
As the lockdown restrictions were lifted, many of the manufacturing concerns went back to their 100pc capacity of production.
Retailer and wholesalers were more affected by Covid-19 restrictions as their business hours were cut short. This segment also believes that the next six months will be better with more sales and profits.
The main driving force behind the turnaround in the latest BCS is the significant increase in optimism of respondents for the next six months regarding their respective city’s business situation (21pc), industry-business situation (19pc), own business situation (20pc), anticipated sales volume increase (20pc), profit increase (22pc) and return on investment increase (19pc).
Feedback from OICCI members who were randomly included in the survey also recorded a “sharp turnaround”. It showed an improvement of 108 percentage points from minus 74pc to 34pc.
Commenting on the improved BCS, OICCI President Irfan Siddiqui said it suggests a “very dramatic turnaround” in the confidence of businesses, including foreign investors. “Despite challenging macro-economic indicators like a high exchange rate and accelerated inflation partially offset by reduced bank interest rate, the latest BCI feedback strongly reflects the optimism of the business community moving forward, contrary to the pessimism in the previous editions,” he said.
He noted that the key drivers of this optimism and turnaround in sentiments are the business community’s positive perception of the future, specifically the next six months.
The 2021-22 budget proved positive for the business community as the BCI score was significantly higher after the budget announcement, with respondents perceiving new policies “more transparent, consistent and predictable”.
According to OICCI CEO M Abdul Aleem, the three major threats to business growth identified by survey respondents are corruption (67pc), volatile energy costs (66pc) and currency devaluation (60pc).
Looking ahead, survey respondents expressed optimism for the next six months, with 25pc expecting expansion in business operations, 39pc planning new capital investment and 12pc indicating plans for increased employment in their respective businesses.
The OICCI has over 200 members from 35 countries and are present in 14 sectors of the economy. They contribute over one-third of Pakistan’s total tax revenue every year.",Newspaper
"Punjab Environment Protection Dept  told to make shopping bags draft bill ‘more implementable’
","August 24, 2021","LAHORE: The Punjab law department has returned the draft of Plastic Shopping Bags Act, 2020 to the environment protection department (EPD) to make it ‘more implementable’.  
Officials told 
 that the EPD had forwarded a draft of the act to the law department for vetting. The law department has returned the bill for making it ‘more implementable.’  
A meeting held recently with EPD secretary Zahid Hussain in the chair discussed the draft.  
Dr. Asif Ali Qaiser, chairman, Polymer Department, UET Lahore, Mr. Mustafa Dogar, additional director general, Punjab Food Authority, representatives of industries department [Babur Munir] and the law department attended the meeting.
Mr. Babur Munir, DEA-III, Industries, Commerce and Investment Department (ICID), referred to the provision of registration and certification of plastic bags manufacturing units in the draft Act which assigns the said functions/duties to the industries department.  
He said except for certain categories of industries falling within Schedule-C of the Industrial Location Policy, the department cannot certify and register industrial units as per rules. He added that checking for chemical polymer of plastic bags is not possible by the industries department due to lack of field expertise and shortage of human resource, whereas, phase-out plan prescribed in the draft legislation requires accuracy of data regarding number of industrial units.  
The PFA additional director general was of the view that a complete ban on the manufacturing, import and sale of polystyrene and plastic bags may be imposed in the best interest of general public and environment.  
The EPD secretary said the meeting was called in view of sharp contrast between the stance of industries department and EPD. The law department advised the EPD to consult the legislative proposal with the ICID and submit the finally agreed proposal for final vetting.  
Prof. Dr. Asif Ali Qaiser, technical expert from UET, recommended providing alternatives in the form of cotton bags and low-cost biopolymer bags. Dr Qaiser raised the issue of non-woven and oxo-biodegradable bags and suggested that the ban on plastic shopping bags should also include the non-woven and oxo-biodegradable bags.  
The meeting was told that the inclusion of polystyrene in the clause 3(f) was intensely suggested by the Punjab food department. It was also suggested that the research on plastic recycling and alternatives shall be supported by the government in the form of establishing academic “Chair of Polymer Recycling & Plastics Alternatives” at the universities where the facilities and expertise are available. The same may be included in the Act and made part of the draft legislation.  
It was proposed that the draft legislation shall allocate a percentage of total production of the bags for the purpose of recycling and its quantum
through scavengers, shall be reported and subsequently verified on a monthly basis. Furthermore, record keeping for all documents/forms shall be included under Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) in draft legislation. Biodegradable and compostable have price constraints, but their utilisation in the market should be encouraged.  
At the end, the EPD secretary directed the EPA director (legal) to amend the draft Plastic Shopping Bags Act, 2021 in the light of discussion and re-submit the same to the law department for final vetting by excluding the role of industries department.
It was also decided that the UET will submit a technical proposal on low-cost environment-friendly alternatives to plastic bags for inclusion in the draft legislation considering re-usability and cost factors while ensuring its thickness and quality. Definition of plastic bag will be incorporated in the draft legislation accordingly.",Pakistan

"Another pregnant doctor dies of Covid-19
","August 24, 2021","KARACHI: Dr Samra Ali, a senior gynaecologist at the Wah International Hospital, Taxila, died of Covid-19 on Sunday.
Her funeral prayers were offered in Sukkur on Monday where she resided.
It’s the second death of a lady doctor from coronavirus in a day.
Flight Lieutenant Dr Mahnoor Farzand 
 at the Combined Military Hospital (CMH), Malir Cantonment, where she remained under treatment for Covid-19 for a week.
According to the Pakistan Medical Association (PMA), both lady doctors were pregnant and not vaccinated against coronavirus.
The total number of doctors lost to Covid-19 in the country now stands at 221.
A Dow Medical College graduate, Dr Ali did her FCPS (Fellowship of the College of Physicians and Surgeons) in gynaecology from the Aga Khan University in 2012.
She stayed for some years in Saudi Arabia and later joined Wah International Hospital Taxila.
“I am at a loss of words to share my sentiments. There is an urgent need to create awareness and educate women especially lady doctors that Covid vaccines are safe for pregnant women and nursing mothers,” said Dr Qaiser Sajjad of the PMA.
He added that Dr Ali was a dedicated, energetic health professional. “She has left behind two sons and a daughter. Her husband is an anaesthetist.”
According to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, although the overall risk of severe illness is low, pregnant and recently pregnant people are at an increased risk for severe illness from Covid-19 when compared with non-pregnant people.
Severe illness includes illness that requires hospitalisation, intensive care, need for a ventilator or special equipment to breathe, or illness that results in death. Additionally, pregnant people with Covid-19 are at increased risk of preterm birth and might be at increased risk of other adverse pregnancy outcomes, compared with pregnant women without Covid-19.
The CDC recommends Covid-19 vaccination for all people aged 12 years and older, including people who are pregnant, breastfeeding, trying to get pregnant now, or might become pregnant in the future.",Pakistan
"Bike riders become essential part of Covid-era economy
","August 24, 2021","KARACHI: Most of us constantly come into contact with riders, sometimes daily. Most seldom give them a second glance.
When 25-year-old Imran asked for water while delivering a parcel to a house during an extremely hot day, the person he asked was taken aback. “It was almost as I was not seen as a human,” he laughed. “I felt weird but it was very hot and I didn’t have any water. I usually keep my contact minimum.”
Imran, who has been working as a rider for a company for a couple of years, didn’t mind the reaction. He is aware that he is invisible to most people but he knows how important his job is. “It’s just like other people working in essential services — most of us are invisible but important. Like the people at a petrol station, how many of us even look at them. They are just voices and shadows in your lives, but if they are not there, it will be difficult to function.”
Recently, riders like Imran have become even more important for the economy as it has shaped over the past year or so with many businesses going online.
Pakistan has seen a rise in demand for businesses over the last year or so, especially since the Covid pandemic has restricted mass movement. Online shopping and delivery have become a big part of our lives, especially the younger generation.
There are so many issues that have to be addressed about motorcycle transport in Pakistan, which is rising rapidly. Planning and appraisal of the policies are needed but this can only be done if proper research is done on this topic.
One person who is aware of the importance of riders is Engineer Murtaza Asad. Asad who is a member of the PSQCA for road safety, road traffic safety management systems, is conducting an important research on bike riders in Pakistan.
Commenting on his research, Engineer Asad said that the employment opportunities created for bike riders are phenomenal and are an improvement on the services that were already being provided by people like electricians, milkmen, and others.
“In this research, we are studying how the unemployment online is tackled by employing bike riders and what are their basic needs such as health, road safety, and maintenance.
Asad has been involved in different projects from which riders will benefit like getting a basic degree, learning new skills, and adding value to their skills to help them in building a professional profile. This is important for the rider and the industry as a whole.
“Our research will help a rider to find out his niches in the industry and improve on them. And for the first time, he will get a letter of experience which will highlight his positives and strengths — for example, what are his interests and where will these interests and skills be better used. If he is good at delivery, customer service, or paperwork. This research will provide data to help companies understand the type of riders’ services they can have,” he said.
Engineer Asad and his team are working on research that has not been done anywhere else. “Our research extends across Pakistan and work is still being done but slowly. The main reason for this is lack of funds for the project. It seems no one wants to invest in this industry, even though it is fast-growing employment — everyone who has a bike can join with small or no investment and earn.”
He said: “We still have to study more than 3.5 million bikes across Pakistan but the funds are the biggest hurdle for this and we are not being supported by anyone. [A private university] had shown interest and was going to sign with us, but it didn’t work. The government is not interested in this project for some reason. The National Transport Research Center (NTRC), Sir Syed University (SSUET) and Transport Engineering Services (TES) all supported the endeavour.""
Riders are also important for another section of society, the parents and families of Pakistanis living abroad who need someone to trust to step in to help to do chores, etc.
This is where Yasir Shirazi comes into the picture. He lives in the US and was constantly thinking of ways to alleviate the burden from his parents’ shoulders, getting things done for them through someone he could trust.
And so he set up InstaKin in 2019 as its founder and CEO and this is his story: “InstaKin’s story is my own story. Almost every migrant I have spoken to can relate to it. I have been an overseas Pakistani for the last 12 years. Like many others, I still need to get tasks accomplished in Pakistan (paying bills, etc). Over the years, I noticed that most overseas Pakistanis specifically (and overall migrant communities in general) would always complain that they are always dependent on busy friends or extended family to manage tasks on their behalf. This causes time-sensitive delays (unfortunately, sometimes there is also misuse of remittance funds).”
Through Shirazi and his team have helped thousands of migrants by providing services like hiring a rider via Instakin for getting medicines delivered to parents in Pakistan (through a service for it known as InstaRunner); getting educational and legal documents attested from back home; sending gifts to loved ones on special occasions; ordering consumer electronics and appliances that can be delivered to family back in Pakistan; hiring an event planner for a family celebration and maybe the most important, paying bills for family back home.
The InstaRunner will help generate new employment opportunities in the country and they estimate that more than 3,000 new jobs will be created directly and via the vendor network over the next two years.",Pakistan

"TTP in disarray after halt to Indian funding for the group: Fawad
","August 24, 2021","Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said on Tuesday that the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) was in a state of ""disarray"" after Indian funding for the militant outfit had stopped.
Addressing a press conference in Islamabad following a meeting of the federal cabinet, Chaudhry said: ""We should be satisfied to know with regards to the TTP that for the first time the process of Indian funding [to them] —  which had been going on for a long time — has ended and at this time they are in disarray."" 
Talking about the TTP's actions inside Pakistan, the minister said Pakistan was not a ""weak country"" and possessed the capability to overcome such challenges. 
""These internal challenges are not a problem for us. Our [belief] is that once they stop having a funding stream from abroad then it will be a big blow for them and the rest we will handle ourselves."" 
He also said that the announcement by the Taliban that Afghanistan would not be allowed to be used for terrorism against any country was a very ""positive"" one. 
""We think the Taliban authorities will act on this. [....] Pakistan's top terrorists from the BLA (Balochistan Liberation Army) and TTP are sitting in Afghanistan and we want them. 
""We hope we will have cooperation from Afghanistan on this. Inside the country we will look at these matters ourselves,"" Chaudhry added. 
His comments come a day after Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid said the Afghan Taliban had 
 that the TTP would not be given permission to operate in Afghanistan against Pakistan.
Rashid said the government was in ""full contact"" with the Taliban on the issue of some TTP members such as Maulvi Faqir Mohammad being released after the takeover of Kabul. 
Last week, the Foreign Office had said that Pakistan would ask the incoming government in Afghanistan to 
.
""Pakistan has been taking up the issue of the use of Afghan soil by the TTP for terrorist activities inside Pakistan with the previous Afghan government and would continue raising the issue with the incoming government in Kabul as well to ensure that the TTP is not provided any space in Afghanistan to operate against Pakistan,” the FO spokesperson had said. 
Chaudhry said the cabinet meeting had also discussed the situation in Afghanistan, particularly Pakistan's ""responsible role"" in the formation of an Afghan government. 
""We have close contact with Turkey, China and other countries [...] so on one hand we are continuing our contact with Afghan authorities and on the other, with foreign countries,"" he said. 
He said the cabinet had also stated that ""India should stay clear of interference in Afghanistan. India has no border with Afghanistan."" 
Dring the former Afghan government's tenure, Chaudhry said, India had used Afghanistan's land against Pakistan and ""at this time too we are seeing a continuous effort visible on Indian media that the Afghan peace process is sabotaged."" 
The minister also provided updates about Pakistan's facilitation of evacuations from Afghanistan, saying that up till now ""thousands of people"" from different nationalities had been evacuated. 
""Over 3,400 people have been evacuated through airplanes, [while] around 19,000 have come through the borders so Pakistan is one of the primary stakeholders in this whole process and we are trying to create this environment so that the people stranded in Kabul can be evacuated,"" he said.
The cabinet also held a discussion on the recent spate of violent incidents against women.
""While addressing the session, Prime Minister Imran Khan said that incidents 
 are very concerning for every segment of the society,"" Chaudhry said. 
He said a response was being seen to developments on social media so ""we have decided to hold a grand debate where people from different sectors will be invited to have a discussion on social media trends so we can have some guidance on where we want to go and what regulations should be brought."" 
Chaudhry said a high-level committee comprising religious scholars, intellectuals and civil society representatives would be formed to enlighten the government on the matter.
Regarding the Covid-19 situation in Pakistan where a fourth wave of the disease is underway due to the spread of the Delta variant, Chaudhry noted that while ""stability was seen"" , the situation in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was concerning. 
He said the number of occupied hospital beds had crossed 1,500 in the two provinces and the total oxygen being used was at 70 per cent capacity. 
""If the situation doesn't improve then we will have to cut down industrial oxygen so we can continue oxygen supply to patients,"" he added. 
The minister said the healthcare system in KP and Punjab was facing a great burden and there was a need to handle the situation to prevent it from worsening.",Pakistan
"Nadra launches app for biometric verification
","September 1, 2021","ISLAMABAD: Keeping pace with technological adv­a­nce­ments, the National Dat­abase and Registration Auth­ority (Nadra) on Tues­day introduced an innovative application enabling pe­o­­ple to use their smartphones for biometric verification. 
Talking to 
, Nadra chairman Tariq Malik said that by introducing the app, Pakistan has accelerated mo­v­ing towards the digital identity lifecycle. “It is a game-changer as it helps create trust in a variety of transactions between people, ide­n­tity providers, and public and private sector,” he said. 
Prime Minister Imran Khan launched Nadra’s Pak-ID mobile application to facilitate applicants of National ID card using Pak-ID portal. 
“Inaugurated PAK-ID Mobile App by NADRA. A revolutionary step in providing convenience, especially to Overseas Pakis­tanis,” he tweeted. “Applicants of http://id.nadra.gov.pk can now capture fingerprints, photograph and documents using mobile phone. Great initiative by Tariq Malik & NADRA team.” 
			
The mobile app helps capture biometrics and scan doc­u­ments digitally by using the camera of smartphones. 
The prime minister lau­ded Nadra Chairman Tariq Malik’s innovative idea of mobile app which he said was a step towards impleme­nting his vision of inclusive registration and digital Pakistan. 
Pakistan becomes trailblazer in ID Management Industry by launching a mobile app which captures biometrics- fingerprints, facial recognition and scan documents needed for processing citizens’ ID cards and documents. 
By using the digital app on smart phones, all citizens including expatriates will be able to digitally capture fingerprints, photographs and documents.

"Revenue collection in August goes up by 45pc
","September 1, 2021","ISLAMABAD: The newly appointed chairman of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), Dr Ashfaq Ahmad, on Tuesday unveiled a roadmap for restructuring tax machinery and declared robust growth of 45 per cent in revenue collection in the second month of the current fiscal.
The revenue collection in August rose to Rs434 billion, an increase of 45pc from last year’s figure of Rs300bn, according to the provisional figures released by Dr Ahmed at a press conference at the FBR headquarters.
The collection rose by Rs85bn or 24pc against the target set for the month, he said. Between July and August, the revenue collection reached Rs849bn against the target of Rs690bn projected for the same months, which was surpassed by Rs159bn or 23pc.
The revenue grew by 41pc when compared with last year collection of Rs603bn during the same months.
Dr Ahmed claimed that the FBR had made significant achievements during the Covid-19 crisis.
The government, while preparing the budget for the ongoing fiscal year, had assured the International Monetary Fund (IMF) of raising Rs5.829 trillion in FY22 against Rs4.721tr collected in FY21.
Based on the performance of the first two months of current fiscal, Dr Ahmed said he was optimistic to achieve the revenue collection target for the current fiscal. “We will achieve our revenue target as the economy has already picked up momentum,” he said.
Dr Ahmed elaborated that his focus would be on automation, facilitation of taxpayers, simplification of tax laws, improving tax enforcement and taking measures of ease of doing business. He further said that his priority focus will be on revenue generation while also focusing on reforms.
One of the priorities, he said, was that information technology equipment would be upgraded under a World Bank-funded project.
He was supported by the FBR IT member who said biddings were in final stage for the purchase of the equipment.
He ruled out the hacking of taxpayers’ data in a recent cyber-attack.
In response to a question, the FBR chairman clarified that the resignation of the chief executive officer of the Pakistan Revenue Automation Pvt Ltd was not linked with the cyber-attack on FBR data system.
Dr Ahmed said it was not the mandate of the FBR to repatriate assets of overseas Pakistanis. He said the FBR could only tax untaxed amount of the people who had not declared their foreign assets in their returns.
Asked about the taxing of foreign assets of Pakistanis, the chairman said in the first two years of the incumbent government, Pakistan received data about the assets of Pakistanis abroad under the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s tax convention. However, he said, all those people had whitened their untaxed money through the tax amnesty scheme announced by the incumbent government. “We have to implement the order of the parliament and the government as implementing body”, the chairman said.
Dr Ahmed, who also holds the post of director general international tax, did not disclose the exact number of people having foreign assets who have availed the tax amnesty.
To another question on laxity in the implementation of benami and money laundering laws, the chairman said progress had been made in both areas. However, he did not support his claim with sharing of any data.
Member Customs Tariq Huda said tangible progress was made in the areas of anti-smuggling measures, which yielded the desired results. He said steps were taken for controlling currency smuggling in the country.
To another question, the FBR chairman said he was against traditional reforms. However, he claimed that he would restructure the FBR headquarter and field formations.
He said he enjoyed full political support and would implement the restructuring plan.
The chairman said anti-smuggling drive would continue in the current fiscal. As a result, regular imports of smuggling-prone items would increase.
According to Mr Ahmed, the amount of refunds disbursed in August was Rs14bn compared to Rs15bn of last year, showing a decline.",Newspaper

According to Ali Jameel, chief executive officer of TPL REIT Management Co, which is targeting to capitalise on the development of construction sector, the company expects to close the deal by June, with an offer of internal rate of return of more than 30 per cent in local currency. 
“TPL REIT Management Co is seeking to raise 60pc of the targeted funds from foreign investors, 30pc from domestic investors and the rest from its parent TPL Properties Ltd,” Mr Jameel was quoted as saying by Bloomberg.

"Li vows China ready to fight for World Cup place
","September 1, 2021","HONG KONG: Chinese football has struggled over the last two decades to build on their only World Cup appearance to date, but coach Li Tie is adamant his China team will be able to secure a place in Qatar in 2022.
China will be appearing in the final phase of the Asia’s World Cup qualifiers for just the second time since featuring in the 2002 finals and face Australia on Thursday in Doha seeking to overcome low expectations.
“You might seem much stronger than us, but that doesn’t mean we don’t stand a chance,” Li warned his side’s rivals before leaving China for Qatar last week.
“One thing is for sure — we have to go all out with a mentality of going to war should we expect to produce any surprises in the qualifying tournament.”
China are an outside bet among the 12 nations seeking one of Asia’s four guaranteed World Cup berths between now and March, despite enhancing an ageing squad with a mix of naturalised players and those with ancestral links to the country.
That deeper talent pool will, however, face the prospect of conducting their campaign largely on the road.
In a tournament already affected by the pandemic, China and Australia will be granted a preview of Doha’s Khalifa International Stadium, one of the venues for next year’s World Cup, rather than meeting in Sydney due to travel restrictions.
The pair have been drawn in Group ‘B’ and will take on four-time Asian champions Japan, five-time World Cup qualifiers Saudi Arabia, up-and-coming Vietnam and Oman. 
Japan are favourites to qualify for a seventh straight finals and host Oman in their opening game while Vietnam make their first-ever appearance in this phase against the Saudis.
Group ‘A’, meanwhile, is comprised of World Cup regulars South Korea and Iran plus Iraq, Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates and Syria.
Paulo Bento will be looking for a winning start to South Korea’s attempt to qualify for a 10th straight World Cup when they host Iraq, led by new coach Dick Advocaat, in Seoul while Iran entertain Syria. The UAE take on Lebanon with Bert van Marwijk attempting to qualify the Gulf state for the World Cup for the first time since their debut appearance in Italy in 1990.

"Afghan Paralympian beats the odds to compete in Tokyo
","September 1, 2021","TOKYO: After a dramatic evacuation from Taliban-held Kabul and a secret operation to fly him to Tokyo, Afghan Paralympian Hossain Rasouli beat the odds on Tuesday to compete in the long jump.
It was not the event he had been expecting to contest, after qualifying for the 100m T47, but then just about everything in his world was turned upside down with the insurgents’ capture of his homeland.
After Taliban overran the capital, he and fellow Afghan Paralympian Zakia Khudadadi found themselves trapped, with no way to get to Tokyo.
At first, it seemed their Paralympic dream was over. A Tokyo 2020 volunteer symbolically carried the Afghan flag during the Games opening ceremony, with no athletes on the ground to take part.
Over the weekend though, officials revealed the Afghan pair had been successfully flown out of the country.
After a stop in Dubai, they were taken to Paris and spent a week at the French sports ministry’s high-performance training centre before flying to Tokyo, where they arrived on Saturday evening.
The pair are being kept away from the media, with the Inter­national Paralympic Committee saying the athletes needed space to focus on their sport.
But IPC spokesman Craig Spence said on Tuesday that Rasouli was  “super excited to be competing today”.
The Afghan emerged from the athletes’ entrance on Tuesday with a wave to team officials dotted around the mostly empty Olympic Stadium.
Rasouli, whose left hand was amputated as the result of a mine explosion, then proudly pointed towards the Afghanistan Paralympic Committee logo on his vest.
The 26-year-old finished last, reflecting his comparative inexperience in the discipline — it was his first time taking part in long jump in a major competition.
Still, Spence said,  “it was great to see him” on what was  “a very special occasion”.
Khudadadi will compete in taekwondo on Thursday.
Elsewhere, there was joy for British cycling great Sarah Storey, who won the C5 road time trial at Fuji International Speedway to equal swimmer Mike Kenny’s all-time British Paralympic Games record of 16 gold medals.
“I’ve been preparing for this race for such a long time. The time trial is probably one of my favourite events,” she said afterwards.
“It’s the ‘race of truth’. It’s you against the clock, and trying to pick off your competitors as you see them.” Storey, who was born without a functioning left arm, has broken 76 world records and shows no sign of slowing down.
The 43-year-old competes next in Thursday’s road race, where she will have the chance to break Kenny’s record, though she said she was not making any assumptions.
“Road races are so unpredictable,” Storey said. “So Thursday morning I’ll come out and try to have some fun and see which way the cookie crumbles.”
There was also joy for Cuba’s  “queen of speed” Omara Durand Elias, who took her sixth Paralympic gold in the 400m T12.
The 29-year-old, who is visually impaired and runs with a guide, said there was no magic recipe to her track dominance.
“My secret is sacrifice for training and good coaching. That is all,” said the Cuban, who will compete in the 100m finals tomorrow and is also aiming to make Saturday’s 200m final.
On a day with 61 golds up for grabs across five sports, there was bitter disappointment for US  “armless archer” Matt Stutzman, who is one of the world’s most recognisable Paralympians.
He missed out on a medal in the men’s compound open class on Tuesday when he fell in the last 16, with a performance that was far below his best.
“I felt like crap. That’s the polite way to say it,” he admitted afterwards. “That was one of my worst scores I’ve shot in probably five years.”
But the 2015 world champion said he was down but not out.
“I’m going to be back in Paris [2024] and my ultimate goal is to represent the US in LA [2028], that will be my last Games,” he said.",Newspaper

"Shortage of vital Covid drug looms in Punjab as sole manufacturer postpones supply
","September 1, 2021","LAHORE: The Punjab government is faced with an acute shortage of the only life-saving injectable drug – Actemra – available for critical Covid patients, after the multinational company, the sole manufacturer world over, has expressed its inability to supply the medicine till December.
The three state-run teaching hospitals having Actemra, have been left with very limited stocks of the medicine that was earlier being provided to all the public and private sector hospitals across the province on a demand basis.
The situation has further compounded for the government as the number of the critical virus patients has increased manifold, as is evident from the official figures that show that nearly 74 percent of the beds at the intensive care units (ICUs) of the public hospitals of Lahore have been occupied, while the company postponed a consignment of 2,000 vials of the drug that was to arrive on Thursday (tomorrow) in the country. The percentage of the occupied beds for critical patients had dropped to only six before the beginning of the fourth spike of the coronavirus in the city.
Meanwhile, as per data released by health department on Tuesday, Punjab reported 1,839 new cases of the infection during the last 24 hours, while the virus claimed lives of 53 more patients during the same period, which was also the highest during the recent wave of the pandemic.
An official privy to the information said the most worrying part of the situation was that the Punjab government had a very limited stock of Actemra, leaving the patients and their families at the mercy of black marketers.
He said though the drug was only being distributed officially, there were multiple complaints that some of the leading private hospitals of the city were charging many times higher than its official price (around Rs80,000 per vial).
The official said that sensing seriousness of the situation, the overnment has constituted a committee comprising three senior medics to recommend measures to overcome the impending crisis. The committee was also directed to prepare proposals to find an alternate drug that could be used to avoid Covid-related complications among the patients during the Actemra shortage in Punjab.
Headed by the King Edward Medical University (KEMU) Dean Prof Saqib Saeed, the committee comprised two leading medical experts -- senior pulmonologist Prof Javed Hayyat from the Pakistan Kidney and Liver Institute (PKLI), Lahore and Associate Prof Somia Iqtidar from Mayo Hospital, Lahore.
The official said the Punjab government had recently placed an order for 2,000 Actemra vials to the multinational company Roche, but it expressed its inability to ensure the supply due to the drug’s shortage in the international market.
In a letter written to the Punjab government on Aug 16, Ali Akbar Lone, the distribution manger of the company in Pakistan, said the global supply situation of Actemra (tocilizumab) had not improved yet. He said in order to ensure an equitable distribution across the world, the company was constantly evaluating the evolving situation, including Pakistan’s demand, and responding accordingly to ensure continuous supply.
Mr Akbar said all steps were being taken to increase the manufacturing capacity by ramping up production networks. “Roche Pakistan Limited is fully aware of the gravity of the situation and is making every effort to make this product available as soon as possible to cater to the urgent and increasing demand of the patients,” reads the letter.
Consultant for Covid in Punjab and KEMU former vice chancellor, Prof Dr Asad Aslam, said the drug’s shortage was discussed in a meeting of the Corona Experts Advisory Group (CEAG) on Monday last. He confirmed that Roche had officially conveyed to the Punjab government about suspension of the supply till December 2021.
“The Punjab government was alive to the patients’ worries as it has allocated sufficient budget for the procurement of Actemra,” he said.
Actemra actually helped reduce pain and swelling caused by rheumatoid arthritis, he added.",Pakistan

Dilating upon the amendments, he said 17 departments were being moved to the south and the secretaries would be fully empowered administratively and the ACS (south Punjab) has been given powers to transfer Grade 17 officers. He has also been given the authority to approve budgets and provide funds to the commissioners, deputy commissioners and assistant commissioners.
The ACS is authorised to write annual confidential reports of secretaries, who will enjoy all powers of promotions, transfers and recruitments given to their counterparts in the northern part of the province. The heads of autonomous bodies, boards, authorities and companies will be answerable to the secretaries, he added. A 33 per cent budget, amounting to Rs190 billion, has been reserved for the south.
Answering a question on law and order, the CM said the government had solved heinous crime cases. “I issued directions to the police after taking notice of such cases and some policemen were also removed from their posts, he said.
The approval of rules of business for the south Punjab secretariat was a historic step to solve problems at the grassroots and the public will not have to visit Lahore for the purpose. “Prime Minister Imran Khan will soon lay the foundation stone for the south secretariat in Bahawalpur,” he added.
Mr Bakht said they worked day and night to formulate the rules of business, adding that this step will remove deprivations and public problems will be resolved at their doorsteps.
Earlier, the 47th provincial cabinet meeting approved amendments to the rules of business. The south Punjab secretariat will comprise three divisions, 11 districts and 17 government departments with complete administrative authority to the south Punjab ACS and secretaries.
The meeting also approved outsourcing of government rest/guest houses. The Tourism Development Corporation of Punjab would be allowed to give government rest/guest houses on a 20-year lease with the option of a 10-year extension.
The cabinet also approved the establishment of Punjab Commission for Illegal Housing Societies headed by retired Justice Azmat Saeed. Matters about the issuance of fitness certificates for transport vehicles were approved along with the decision to amend Punjab Pension Fund and Punjab General Provident Investment Fund’s Act.",Pakistan
"Turning from Afghanistan, US sets focus on China
","September 1, 2021","After two decades of focus on Afghanistan, the US withdrawal this week allows the country to shift its concentration to the east, where superpower rival China is now the top priority.
In an indication of Washington's strategic turn, Vice President Kamala Harris was in Southeast Asia 
 even as the US pullout from Afghanistan moved into its 
, hoping to strengthen US allies' pushback against the region's giant.
Harris 
 Beijing of “actions that... threaten the rules-based international order,” particularly its aggressive claims of territory in the South China Sea.
Her tour of Singapore and Vietnam was seen as an effort by the administration of President Joe Biden to reassure Asian allies, who were left somewhat disquieted by the US pullout from Kabul after the sudden 
 that Washington had propped up for nearly 20 years.
Ryan Hass, a foreign policy specialist at Brookings Institution, said the debacle of the US pullout from Afghanistan will not have a lasting impact on Washington's credibility in Asia.
“America's standing in Asia is a function of its shared interests with its partners in balancing China's rise and in preserving the long peace that has underpinned the region's rapid development,” Hass said. “None of those factors are diminished by events in Afghanistan.""
Washington's turn to East Asia will “open up new opportunities” for the US and its partners in the region, he told 
.
Lawmaker Adam Smith, head of the Armed Forces Committee in the House of Representatives, said that the US exit from Afghanistan is not likely to change the balance between the US and rival superpowers Russia and China.
He rejected suggestions on Tuesday that the seeming momentary display of weakness by the Americans could encourage China to invade Taiwan or Russia to attack Ukraine, for example.
“I think anyone who thinks that their [Russia's or China's] calculation has significantly changed because we just pulled the last 2,500 troops out of Afghanistan — I really don't see that,” Smith said during an online Brookings conference.
“There are a lot of other issues that go into whether or not Russia and China are going to feel like they have the ability to be aggressive in those parts of the world,” he said.
Derek Grossman, a former Pentagon official and now a defense expert at the Rand Corporation think tank, said China could seek an advantage in fostering good relations with the Afghan Taliban.
Beijing could decide quickly to recognise the Taliban government, even as Washington and other Western governments hold off as they hope to convince Afghanistan's new rulers to moderate their hardline policies.
“China, as a new great power in competition with the US, probably wants to demonstrate its unique way of handling world events, which tends to be — often reflexively — the opposite of Washington's approach,” Grossman said.
“Recognising Taliban-run Afghanistan would contribute to the perception that it is Beijing, and no longer Washington, that is now setting the agenda and shaping the future regional order,” he said.",World
"PM Imran launches Ehsaas Education Stipends programme
","September 1, 2021","Prime Minister Imran Khan on Wednesday launched the Ehsaas Education Stipends programme for ""deserving"" families so that they could send their children for education.
Addressing the launch ceremony for the programme in Islamabad, the premier said that 20 million children not going to schools was a ""major issue"" for the country, and regretted that due importance was not paid to their education, adding that it was important to rectify the issue. 
He said a country's biggest assets ""are its people"" and that not providing them education was akin to ""wasting your asset"". 
""By denying the opportunity for upwards [social] mobility, you do a great injustice with that segment,"" he said. 
The stipend initiative, the premier said, would serve to ""incentivise and encourage"" children to attend schools. 
The prime minister particularly highlighted how more girls were out of school than boys. ""We did not give importance to education but especially, and unfortunately, we did not give importance to the girls' education,"" he said. 
The prime minister said that a well-educated woman was of greater benefit to the society than a well-educated man because she ""teaches her kids and changes the entire system of her household [such as] health and wellbeing of children, which have a lot of societal impact"". 
""The West says that we do not want to educate our girls but this is not the case. I've visited every region of Pakistan [...] and nowhere did I go and see such households where parents wanted their girls to not study,"" the he said.
PM Imran said other issues, such as ease of access, contributed more to a lack of girls' education than the will of the parents. He identified a dearth of schools and faculty as the driving factors behind the menace.
""Parents from everywhere ask me to open schools for girls so it is not that they don't want to educate [their daughters],"" he said. ""It was the government duty to facilitate them that was missing till now.""
The prime minister also praised the incorporation of information technology (IT) in the programme to ensure transparency and ward off corruption. 
""Through [the use of] IT, we will attain control over most of these issues and, in a very transparent manner, [distribute] these stipends to children and incentivise them and monitor them,"" he added. 
According to a statement issued by the Prime Minister's Office, the stipend will be given to ""deserving parents"", who can ensure 70 per cent attendance of their children in schools. 
""In this programme, the amount of stipend has been kept especially higher for girls. School stipends are for primary, secondary and higher secondary education,"" it added. 
			 
A press release said that the programme would be 
 across all districts. 
It said that at the primary level, the boys will get quarterly stipends of Rs1,500 and girls Rs2,000; at the secondary level, the boys will get Rs2,500 and girls Rs3,000; and at the higher secondary level, boys will get Rs3,500 and girls Rs 4,000. The stipends will be issued every quarter.",Pakistan
"Citizens below 18 years to be administered Pfizer shots: NCOC
","September 1, 2021","The National Command and Operating Centre (NCOC) on Wednesday revised its Covid-19 vaccination guidelines for citizens below the age of 18.
""The general public age group for vaccination has been lowered to 17 years,"" the NCOC said, adding that the Pfizer vaccine will be administered to those who are below 18 years of age.
People below the age of 18 will have to provide their B-form number for registration in the National Immunisation Management System, the NCOC statement said.
Meanwhile, the statement added that immunocompromised individuals between 12 to 17 years of age will also be vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine.
However, they will currently need to show their medical documents as proof as the vaccination drive has only been opened to persons above 17 years of age for now.
Earlier, students below the age of 18, who plan on travelling abroad, had been 
 to get the Moderna vaccine.
Speaking to 
, the National Health Services ministry spokesperson, Sajid Shah, said individuals over 17 years would have to get one dose by Sept 15 and be fully vaccinated by Oct 15 otherwise they would not be allowed to enter educational institutions.
He said those who were immunocompromised and over the age of 12 could get the jabs at selected vaccination centres after they showed their medical record, advising parents to ensure that their children received the vaccines.
“From Wednesday (today) at least partially vaccinated transporters will be allowed to pick and drop students and from Sept 30 onwards, only fully vaccinated people will be able to continue their transport businesses that cater to students,” Shah said.
Similarly, he said, partially vaccinated people could enter and work in shopping malls but they would have to be fully vaccinated by Sept 30, which was the cut-off date for them.
He said air travel restrictions were already in place since the start of August, and people who were at least partially vaccinated could undertake domestic air travel.
“However, after Sept 30, only fully vaccinated people would be allowed to undertake domestic and international air travel, and this restriction would be for both inbound and outbound travelers,” the spokesperson said.
Similarly, in order to travel on trains and buses and use highways and motorways, citizens will have to be partially vaccinated by Sept 15 and completely inoculated by Oct 15.
He said vaccines were available and thousands of vaccination centres had been opened, so “we cannot allow anyone to play with the health of vulnerable people”.
The spokesperson said booster shots would also be available from Sept 1 to those planning to travel abroad.
“But, since a booster dose is a travel requirement and not a health-related necessity, Rs1,270 would be charged for each dose,” Shah said, adding that an app could be downloaded to get a vaccination pass as well as proof that the person was vaccinated.
Last week, the NCOC had decided to 
 for Covid-19 vaccination from 18 years to 15 years.
The decision was shared by federal Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Asad Umar and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) on Health Dr Faisal Sultan during a press conference in Islamabad.
“From September 1 teenagers over 17 years of age will be allowed to get first dose and will have to get one dose by September 15. They will have to be fully vaccinated by October 15, otherwise they will not be allowed in educational institutions. After that, 16 years to 17 years age group and then 15 years to 16 years age group will be allowed to get vaccinated. Dates for vaccination of the other two groups [from 15 to 17] will be announced soon,” Dr Sultan had said.
He had said that those who were immunocompromised and over the age of 12 will be able to be vaccinated at selected vaccination centres after checking their medical record. He had advised parents to ensure that their children were vaccinated.",Pakistan
"Assets of Shehbaz’s daughter, son-in-law attached
","September 12, 2021","LAHORE: The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) informed an accountability court on Saturday that properties owned by the Leader of Opposition in the National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif’s daughter Rabia and son-in-law Imran Ali Yousaf have been attached because of them being absconders in the Punjab Saaf Pani Company reference. 
Senior Special Prosecutor Asadullah Malik submitted a report before the court along with details of the assets attached under Section 88 of CrPC. The assets included shares in M/s Ali & Fatima Developers Pvt Ltd, M/s Ali Processed Food Pvt Ltd, Madina Food Pvt Ltd, Ghausul Azam Developers and multiple floors in Ali Towers and Ali Trade Centre on MM Alam Road, Gulberg, Lahore. 
Presiding Judge Sajid Ali adjourned the hearing till Sept 23 and sought arguments on the acquittal applications filed by other suspects in the reference. 
The other suspects in the reference included former Saaf Pani Company chairman and former PML-N MPA Raja Qamarul Islam, former chief executive officer of the company Waseem Ajmal, Masood Akhtar, Waris Ali, Khalid Nadeem Bokhari, Azharuddin and Saleem Akhtar. 
In the reference, the NAB has alleged that Islam, being chairman of the company, committed corruption in the award of contracts of 84 water filtration plants at higher prices. It said the suspect got the contracts of 102 plants approved from the company’s board of directors and forged the documents. 
The bureau accused Ajmal of violating procurement rules and permitting installation of the water plants in Dunyapur tehsil beyond the scope of the project.

"Mars rocks collected by rover boost case for ancient life
","September 12, 2021","WASHINGTON: NASA’s Perse­ve­rance Mars rover has now collected two rock samples with signs that they were in contact with water for a long period of time, boosting the case for ancient life on the Red Planet. 
“It looks like our first rocks reveal a potentially habitable sustained environment,” said Ken Farley, project scientist for the mission, in a statement on Friday.  
“It’s a big deal that the water was there for a long time.”  The six-wheeled robot collected its first sample, dubbed “Montdenier” on September 6, and its second, “Montagnac” from the same rock on September 8. 
Both samples, slightly wider than a pencil in diameter and about six centimetres long, are now stored in sealed tubes in the rover’s interior. 
A first attempt at collecting a sample in early August failed after the rock proved too crumbly to withstand Perseverance’s drill. 
The rover has been operating in a region known as the Jezero Crater, just north of the equator and home to a lake 3.5 billion years ago, when conditions on Mars were much warmer and wetter than today. 
The rock that provided the first samples was found to be basaltic in composition and likely the product of lava flows. 
Volcanic rocks contain crystalline minerals that are helpful in radiometric dating. 
This in turn could help scientists build up a picture of the area’s geological history, such as when the crater formed, when the lake appeared and disappeared, and how climate changed over time. 
“An interesting thing about these rocks as well is that they show signs for sustained interaction with groundwater,” NASA geologist Katie Stack Morgan told a press conference. 
The scientists already knew the crater was home to a lake, but couldn’t rule out the possibility that it had been a “flash in the pan” with floodwaters filling up the crater for as little as 50 years. Now they are more certain groundwater was present for much longer. 
“If these rocks experienced water for long periods of time, there may be habitable niches within these rocks that could have supported ancient microbial life,” added Stack Morgan. 
The salt minerals in the rock cores may have trapped tiny bubbles of ancient Martian water. 
“Salts are great minerals for preserving signs of ancient life here on Earth, and we expect the same may be true for rocks on Mars,” added Stack Morgan. 
NASA is hoping to return the samples to Earth for in-depth lab analysis in a joint mission with the European Space Agency sometime in the 2030s.",Newspaper

"Pakistan’s response to Covid-19 better than other countries in region: PM’s aide
","September 12, 2021","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic has been much better than other countries in the region keeping in view its socioeconomic and other factors to pre-empt adverse impacts of the virus, said Senator Dr Sania Nishtar.
She was addressing an international conference on Covid-19 and South Asia organised by the School of Public Health and Centre for Contemporary South at Brown University. She had been invited to share lessons from Pakistan regarding the pandemic and its impacts.
Speakers from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and India joined virtually. Other speakers were from Brown University, Yale University, Harvard University and civil society organisations.
Dr Nishtar said: “Pakistan fared much better than other countries in the region with respect to its response to Covid-19. High level political attention and balanced approach for action, health vs-a-vis livelihoods overseen and led by Prime Minister Imran Khan himself played key role in tackling the issue.”
However, we are currently experiencing the fourth wave, so there is no space for complacency, she told the conference.
Recently, Pakistan has also been ranked the third best worldwide in terms of its effective management of the pandemic. Also, according to the World Bank, Ehsaas emergency cash was the third largest programme in terms of percentage of population covered, and fastest globally in terms of the speed of disbursement of cash to the Covid-19 affectees, she said.
Pakistan has vaccinated more than 21 million people, administering over 65.5 million doses of vaccines, and the target is to vaccinate nearly 70 million people by the end of the year.
The conference focused on different responses from various countries. The pandemic affected all countries but the outcomes varied significantly. Suffering in some countries was substantially greater compared to others based mainly on the level of outbreak of the disease and response.
The speakers said government policies, the strength of public health systems, citizen mobilisation, vaccine availability and administration had mattered in different ways.  
There is a need to understand how these factors, and potentially others, came together to generate the outcomes we have thus far observed and responded, the participants noted.",Pakistan

"Local investors help PSX bounce back
","September 12, 2021","KARACHI: The stock market managed to bounce back in the outgoing week with the KSE-100 index locking in gains of 241 points, or 0.5 per cent, to close at 47,198 points.
The early days of the week witnessed extension of the bearish spell of last week as investors remained spooked by a volley of bad news including the huge trade deficit of $4.1 billion in August; depreciation of the rupee against the dollar; higher commodity prices; uncertainties on the geo-political front and the ever-changing situation of the Covid-19 pandemic in the country.
During the week, the much-anticipated decision of the MSCI to downgrade Pakistan to Frontier Market (FM) from the Emerging Market (EM) set the market direction, with foreign investors embarking on a major sell-off. However, in the last two days of the week the market staged a strong rally where local buyers rushed to pick up oversold stocks trading at attractive valuations.
Foreign investors intensified selling during the week which amounted to $18.6 million against net sale of stocks worth $5.9m the earlier week. Outflow was witnessed in Commercial Banks of $10.9m, Cement $6.1m and Exploration & Production $0.9m. On the domestic front, Individuals were major buyers of shares valued at $12.9m and Insurance Companies $6.2m. Average daily traded volumes clocked-in at 429m shares with TPL leading the volume leaders with change of hands in 175m shares.
According to AHL calculations, sector-wise positive contributions came from Technology & Communication (214 points), Miscellaneous (168 points), Commercial Banks (148 points), Pharmaceuticals (59 points), and Food & Personal Care Products (14 points). Cement sector pulled the index down, erasing 155 points and 2.6pc of the sector value week-on-week as coal prices continued to trade at nearly 10-year high.
Scrip-wise, positive contributors were made by PSEL (164 points), MEBL (147 points), Systems (115 points), TRG (99 points) and Nestle (39 points). Major laggards included LUCK (103 points), HBL (57 points) and Engro (51 points).
Going forward, the market is likely to remain range bound as a major rally in the last two days of the outgoing week catapulted the KSE-100 index to over 47,200 points. It has continued to provide tough resistance in the past. Strong positive triggers would be required for the index to continue the north-ward journey.
Foreign outflow was witnessed in the two days following the announcement of MSCI downgrade while the sell-off was absorbed mainly by the individuals and brokers. It has to be seen if the institutional investors join to continue the rally.
Investors would now watch out for the next major event of the IMF board’s approval of the next review for a positive outcome. Sto­c­ks in certain sectors are still attractively priced. The gaining momentum was built around the technology sector where major stocks grabbed the spotlight.",Newspaper
"Talks with IMF for sixth tranche to start by month-end
","September 12, 2021","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan will start staff-level discussions with the International Monetary Fund by end of the current month for the release of sixth tranche under the $6 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF), a top official confirmed 
 on Saturday.
The IMF board has a scheduled a meeting later this month to conduct its sixth review of Pakistan programme. “Our technical team will start virtual discussions with the IMF technical team on Sept 29,” Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin told 
.
He went on to say that a list of issues to be discussed was received from the fund. “The final approval will be made in Washington by middle of next month.” Mr Tarin added.
The finance minister will be in Washington for discussions with top IMF officials from Oct 15-17.
In July 2019, the IMF had approved a 39-month $6bn EFF arrangement for Pakistan to support Islamabad’s economic reform programme.
The government has paused the IMF programme for three months and implements its indigenous policy measures to shore up revenue instead of putting an extra burden on the existing taxpayers.
Mr Tarin said that the revenue performance in the first two months is beyond expectations. “We have proved that our strategy of revenue generation is better than the one prescribed by the fund,” the minister said, adding it would be even better than last year.
The minister said that his policy prescriptions paid dividends. “We are sticking to what we think is right and they are sticking to what they are saying is right,” the minister remarked.
It is worth mentioning that Oct 17 will be the last day of Mr Tarin as federal finance minister representing Pakistan at top-level talks in Washington.
Mr Tarin’s visit will take place at the time of the expiry of the constitutional tenure as federal finance minister as he had been given the portfolio on April 16 this year under Article 91(9) of the Constitution, which empowers the prime minister to appoint a non-elected person as a federal minister for six months.
The government has recently promulgated an ordinance to make it mandatory for an elected person to take oath within 60 days apparently to de-seat self-exiled former finance minister Ishaq Dar to clear the seat for Mr Tarin to elect him as a senator.
The rupee in recent weeks has weakened sharply against the dollar while the State Bank of Pakistan has yet to intervene to arrest the local currency’s slide.
Asked about the exchange rate volatility, Mr Tarin said that ‘speculators’ created artificial demand. However, he admitted that there is pressure on exchange rate mainly because of speculation over balance of payment issues because of rising import bill. “This is not sustainable and has no base for support,” the minister warned speculators and predicted it will come down.
The rupee has hit a over year’s low, while the the State Bank projects that the current account deficit may widen by 2pc-3pc this fiscal year, against 0.6pc in FY21, on rising imports to support the growth target of 4.8pc.
The minister ruled out the impression created through social media that the rupee will fall to Rs170. “We purchased $450m worth vaccines last month which has driven the country’s import bill,” the minister said.
He said the vaccine purchase is already financed by donor agencies. However, the purchase has pushed up the import bill. He, however, agreed that it will have an impact on the balance of payments, which might go into negative.
The minister said speculators will get temporary benefits because of the pressures on the rupee.
“The State Bank of Pakistan is watching the situation and will intervene when required,” the minister said. However, he did not mention the level when it will make it compulsory for SBP to intervene.
The minister said that the current exchange rate at Rs166 or Rs167 is almost 98pc real exchange rate. He brushed aside the speculation that exchange rate will cross Rs174 or beyond.
On the issue of current account, the minister said that he was constantly reviewing the imports trends. “We will review in case there are unnecessary imports,” the minister hinted at regulatory duties to slow down the imports of luxury items if required.
Besides, the spending on one time import of vaccines the minister said that import bill is also swelled by the import of automobile sector especially CBUs. “We will also look into this issue”, the minister said, adding the automobile sector revives because of slowdown last year mainly hit by the Covid-19.",Newspaper

Factory’s owner Hassan Meetha alias Ali Meetha, its building’s owner Faisal Tariq, three supervisors — Syed Imran Ali Zaidi, Zafar and Rehan and watchman Syed Zarin — have been booked for their alleged involvement in the death of the 16 workers.
Police had arrested Hassan Meetha, Faisal Tariq and Imran Ali Zaidi after District and Sessions Judge (East) Khalid Hussain Shahani had revoked their interim pre-arrest bail.
On Saturday, the investigating officer, Sub-inspector Izzat Khan, produced the held suspects before the judicial magistrate (East) upon expiry of their physical remand in police custody.
The IO submitted that the court had revoked the interim bail of the suspects on Sept 7 after examining building code and relevant laws.
He submitted that the sessions court had observed that “the authorities, who failed to discharge their functions include the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA), labour department and inspectors, deputy commissioner concerned, Karachi Development Authority (KDA) and Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC, Civil Defence Department). These all are responsible for the offence and ought to be implicated, investigated and taken to the task for the alleged crime”.

"Women can study in gender-segregated universities, say Afghan Taliban
","September 12, 2021","Women in Afghanistan can continue to study in universities, including at postgraduate levels, but classrooms will be gender-segregated and Islamic dress is compulsory, the higher education minister in the new Taliban government said on Sunday.
The minister, Abdul Baqi Haqqani, laid out the new policies at a news conference, several days after Afghanistan's new rulers 
 an all-male government. On Saturday, the Taliban had raised their flag over the presidential palace, signalling the start of the work of the new government.
The world has been watching closely to see to what extent the Taliban might act differently from their first time in power, in the late 1990s. During that era, girls and women were denied an education and were excluded from public life.
The Taliban have suggested they have changed, including in their attitudes toward women. However, women have been banned from sports and the Taliban have used violence in recent days against women protesters demanding equal rights.
Haqqani said the Taliban did not want to turn the clock back 20 years. ""We will start building on what exists today,"" he said.
However, female university students will face restrictions, including a compulsory dress code. Haqqani said hijabs will be mandatory but did not specify if this meant compulsory headscarves or also compulsory face coverings.
Gender segregation will also be enforced, he said. ""We will not allow boys and girls to study together,"" he said. ""We will not allow co-education.""
 
Haqqani said the subjects being taught would also be reviewed. While he did not elaborate, he said he wanted graduates of Afghanistan's universities to be competitive with university graduates in the region and the rest of the world.
The Taliban banned music and art during their previous time in power. This time around television has remained and news channels still show women presenters, but the Taliban messaging has been erratic.
In an interview on Afghanistan's popular 
, Taliban spokesman Syed Zekrullah Hashmi said women should give birth and raise children and while the Taliban have not ruled out eventual participation of women in government, the spokesman said it's not necessary that women be in the cabinet.
The Taliban 
 on Aug 15, the day they overran the capital of Kabul after capturing outlying provinces in a rapid military campaign. They initially promised inclusiveness and a general amnesty for their former opponents, but many Afghans remain deeply fearful of the new rulers. 
Taliban police officials have 
 Afghan journalists, violently dispersed women's protests and formed an all-male government despite saying initially they would invite broader representation.
The new higher education policy signals a change from the accepted practice before the Taliban takeover. Universities were co-ed, with men and women studying side by side, and female students did not have to abide by a dress code. However, the vast majority of female university students opted to wear headscarves in line with traditions.
In elementary and high schools, boys and girls were taught separately, even before the Taliban came to power. In high schools, girls had to wear tunics reaching to their knees and white headscarves, and jeans, makeup and jewellery were not permitted.",World
"Third LNG terminal to end Karachi industry’s gas woes: SSGC
","September 17, 2021","KARACHI: Gas shortages for industries, especially in winters, will end after installation of third liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal at the Port Qasim in a year or two, said Sui Southern Gas Company Ltd (SSGCL) managing director Imran Maniar.
Speaking with businessmen at the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) on Thursday,
Mr Maniar admitted that there were difficulties and challenges but the picture is rosy as the activation of the third LNG terminal will certainly help in resolving gas shortage issue being suffered by all types of consumers in Karachi.
Explaining overall gas demand and supply situation, he said a total of 4,000 mmcfd gas including indigenous gas and regasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG) is being used all over the country of which around 950 mmcfd is being provided to SSGCL from indigenous resources in Sindh and Balochistan, while 150 mmcfd of RLNG is also being given to them and the rest of gas is being used by the SNGPL.
According to a KCCI press release, Mr Maniar said SSGCL takes 110 mmcfd from natural resources in Balochistan while the rest of 75 per cent gas comes into the system from resources in Sindh, but these gas reserves are depleting fast at a rate of 10pc per annum, he warned.
The SSGCL takes around 150-180 mmcfd of RLNG from two terminals at Port Qasim, but the supply reduces to 70-80 mmcfd in winters while the demand for gas in Balochistan rises to 120 mmcfd, thus creating an overall shortage of around 195 mmcfd, he said.
To deal with shortages, the government has designed a mechanism in which all the consumers from domestic to industrial have been ranked from top to bottom in which domestic consumers were at the top of the list, followed by export-oriented industry, while CNG stations were at the bottom of the list and non-export industry was above CNG stations, he elaborated.
Mr Maniar said SSGCL carries out load management during winter season exactly as per the government list whereas RLNG supplies to KE are completely cut to zero that helps in covering the gas shortage by 75-80 mmcfd whereas suspension of gas to CNG stations further saves 20 mmcfd that leads to reducing the gas shortfall by 95 mmcfd, out of a total shortfall of 195 mmcfd, he added.
Businessman Group chairman Zubair Motiwala pointed out that the first and foremost problems being faced by gas consumers were the low gas pressure in the industrial zones of Karachi, thus affecting local production and exports.
The data of last one decade indicates that 1,200 mmcfd of gas was available from indigenous resources 10 years ago when the industries were utilising around 385 mmcfd gas and then around seven years ago, a decline to 335 mmcfd was witnessed in the industrial consumption which later on picked up but to date, the maximum industrial consumption was not more than 400 mmcfd, he said.
He was of the view that demand from industries during winter remains intact yet the industries suffer the most which was not a correct approach. The demand for gas rises in Balochistan to 200 mmcfd from around 40 to 50 mmcfd and it also increases in Sindh during winter season. Hence, the gas shortage was not because of rise in demand by the industry but purely due to enhanced consumption by domestic users.
Meanwhile, SSGCL in a press release announced resumption of RLNG supplies from Engro’s LNG terminal.
SSGCL has gradually started supplying gas to K-Electric, FFBQL and Sindh Nooriabad Power Company, in accordance to their respective pre dry docking intakes. The overall gas pressure in Karachi has also improved remarkably, the company said.",Pakistan
"Pakistan becomes self-sufficient in mung bean output
","September 17, 2021","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has become self-sufficient in mung bean production as the first estimate of the crop for 2021-22 records the legume output at 253,000 tonnes against the national requirement of about 180,000 tonnes.
The self-sufficiency in mung bean — a major edible legume in Asia — was announced during the annual review and planning meeting for Rabi 2021-22 on Thursday. The meeting was organised by the Pakistan Agricultural Research Cou­ncil (PARC) for its Public Sector Development Prog­ramme-funded project ‘Pro­moting Research for Prod­uctivity Enhancement in Pulses’.
Minister for National Food Security and Research Syed Fakhr Imam, who attended the annual review meeting, said the government was willing to take steps for promoting production of pulses in the country if strategies like the one adopted by PARC are brainstormed and implemented in letter and spirit. The proposed buyback mechanism will be profitable for the farmers and will certainly entice the farmers to cultivate pulse commodities, he added.
In his presentation on the impact of the project, PARC National Coordinator of Plant Sciences Division Dr Muhammad Mansoor Joyia said the area under mung bean during 2020-21 incr­eased by 35 per cent while production increased by 65pc in Punjab, 6pc in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and 17pc in Balochistan.
At the same time, cultivation area under mash bean increased by 19pc, while production increased by 27pc in Balochistan. He further explained that the area under chickpea increased by 22pc and production by 23pc. The area under lentil increased by 17.5pc and the production increased in Balochistan by 18pc.",Newspaper
"FIFA intensifies push to stage World Cup every two years
","September 17, 2021","ZURICH: FIFA intensified its push for hosting the World Cup every two years on Thursday by garnering support from football fans around the world to help combat resistance from Europe and South America. 
The latest public relations tactic came in the form on an online survey commissioned by FIFA.
The FIFA statement did not provide data, details of the polling methodology or questions asked, but claimed its findings showed “considerable differences between the so-called traditional markets and the developing football markets.”
European football body UEFA and South American counterpart CONMEBOL oppose FIFA’s plan and have threatened to boycott additional World Cups. Europe and South America combine for 65 of the 211 FIFA members fewer than the one-third total likely needed to block any proposal.
The governing bodies of the six continental football federations all stage their own championships, with Europe hosting its tournament every four years halfway between the World Cups. Adding an extra World Cup in every four-year cycle would likely cut into the European events revenue stream. 
FIFA’s controversial proposal of a biennial World Cup, first floated in the 1990s, was revived by FIFA’s head of Global Football Development, former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger. 
FIFA’s congress in May voted by a large majority to conduct a feasibility study into the potential of holding the World Cup every two years instead of every four years. 
FIFA said it used polling company YouGov and that the 15,000 respondents “were identified as expressing an interest in football and the FIFA World Cup, from a broader market research survey involving 23,000 people in 23 countries, across the organisation’s six confederations.” 
It said the majority of fans would like to see a more frequent men’s World Cup and of those respondents, a majority preferred a biennial competition. 
The most favourable towards this increased frequency are the  “younger generations in all regions” and  “developing markets”, while older football lovers remain attached to the tradition of a four-yearly tournament which has been in place since the first World Cup in 1930. 
The organisation said that it would publish full details of the survey and added that an expanded survey involving 100,000 people in more than 100 countries was currently underway. 
FIFA’s latest survey follows one week after it hosted about 80 former international players, including several World Cup winners, for a two-day meeting in Qatar — the 2022 World Cup host country. 
The players reported they all agreed it was a good idea to double the number of men’s World Cups in each four-year period. 
FIFA president Gianni Infantino believes staging more tournaments would increase opportunities and enthusiasm in most of the 211 member countries, many of which never qualify to play at the World Cup. 
Expanding the World Cup from 32 teams to 48 starting at the 2026 tournament in North America was one of the biggest early decisions of Infantino’s presidency, which began in 2016. FIFA also wants to distribute extra World Cup revenue to improve talent development and help national teams globally close the gap on Europe. 
European teams have won the past four World Cups and filled 13 of the 16 semi-final slots. The other three semi-finalists from 2006-18 were from South America. 
The UEFA-backed Football Supporters Europe group also opposed the biennial World Cup plan, claiming it would distort the balance between domestic and international football, and club and national teams. 
Global players union FIFPRO has also warned of burnout in the increasingly congested football schedule. 
However, the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) said it welcomes the consultation process and CONCACAF, which organises the game in North and Central America and the Caribbean, says it is studying the plans. 
Wenger says that the status quo causes too much disruption and forces players to make too many long trips around the world for qualifiers and friendly matches. He says his system would streamline the process while still keeping the balance of 80% club football and 20% national team football. 
Any final decision on the proposal would have to be made by a FIFA Congress, which usually takes place in May.",Newspaper
"France suspends 3,000 unvaccinated health workers
","September 17, 2021","PARIS: Thousands of health workers across France have been suspended without pay for failing to get vaccinated against Covid-19 ahead of a deadline this week, Health Minister Olivier Veran said on Thursday.
France’s national public health agency estimated last week that roughly 12 per cent of hospital staff and around six per cent of doctors in private practices have yet to be vaccinated.
“Some 3,000 suspensions were notified yesterday to employees at health centres and clinics who have not yet been vaccinated,” Veran told 
 radio.
He added that “several dozens” had turned in their resignations rather than sign up for the jabs.
That compares with 2.7 million health workers overall, Veran said, adding that “continued healthcare is assured.” “A large number of these suspensions are only temporary” and mainly concern support staff, with “very few nurses” among those told to stay home, he said.
Based on figures provided by individual hospitals, the actual number of suspended employees could be higher.
The Paris hospital system said that 340 workers had been suspended.
Local press reports have cited large numbers at hospitals in smaller cities — up to 450 in Nice and 100 in Perpignan.
Available figures point to nearly 1,500 suspensions at just over a dozen hospitals, according to a tally, with dozens more elsewhere across France.
President Emmanuel Macron gave staff at hospitals, retirement home workers and the fire service an ultimatum in July to get at least one shot by September 15 or face unpaid suspension.
France has also made a Covid “health pass” mandatory for entering cafes, restaurants and many other public places, prompting weekly protests by tens of thousands of people who claim they are being discriminated against.
Many healthcare workers are still avoiding jabs, citing safety or efficacy concerns, raising the spectre of disruptions to services in facilities forced to suspend staff without pay.
Overall, 70 percent of the French have received both doses required to be fully vaccinated, which are available to everyone over age 12 — one of the highest rates in the world.
But 74 percent have had one dose only, suggesting that many people are holding out against the jabs despite their widespread availability — and as the more contagious Delta variant spreads worldwide.
While vaccines have helped France limit a “fourth wave” of infections, with fewer than 2,000 Covid patients now in intensive care each day, Veran said it is “too early” to considering lifting the health pass requirement.
“There are still around 10,000 new cases each day — the pandemic isn’t over,” he said.
On Wednesday, the health ministry reported 79 Covid deaths over the previous 24 hours, bringing the French total to 115,829.",Newspaper
"Unicef urges all states to reopen schools
","September 17, 2021","MANILA: The United Nations children’s agency Unicef has urged education authorities to reopen schools as soon as possible in countries where millions of students are still not allowed to return to classrooms 18 months into the Covid-19 pandemic.
Schools in around 17 countries remain fully closed, while those in 39 countries remain partially closed, according to a report released by Unicef on Thursday.
Among those “almost completely closed” are schools usually attended by nearly 77 million students in the Philippines, Bangladesh, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, Panama and Kuwait.
Nearly a third of this figure is accounted for by the Philippines, which is fighting one of Asia’s worst coronavirus outbreaks and where a new school year started this week.
Pupils from the six countries represent more than half of the 131 million students worldwide that have missed more than three-quarters of their in-person learning, Unicef said.
“The education crisis is still here, and with each passing day that classrooms remain dark, the devastation worsens,” said Unicef Executive Director Henrietta Fore.
The report said teachers should be prioritised for Covid-19 vaccines, after health workers and those most at risk, to protect them from community transmission.
Students may be safer at home, but the availability of computers, mobile phones and internet, and the uneven quality of education, are among challenges they continue to face.
In the Philippines, some children have been forced to climb onto roofs just to get an internet signal.
In June, President Rodrigo Duterte rejected a proposal to allow face-to-face classes to resume in some areas, saying: “I cannot gamble on the health of the children.”
In a report released in April, the Asian Development Bank estimated school closures lasting more than a year could slash future earnings among the region’s students by as much as $1.25 trillion, or equivalent to 5.4pc of GDP in 2020.
Unicef and its partners will shut down their digital channels for 18 hours on Thursday to draw attention to the crisis and the “18 months of lost learning”.
“This is a crisis we will not allow the world to ignore,” Unicef’s Fore said. “Our channels are silent, but our message is loud: Every community, everywhere must reopen schools as soon as possible.”",Newspaper

"Javed Latif becomes a bone of contention between Sharifs
","September 17, 2021","LAHORE: PML-N MNA Javed Latif has reportedly become a bone of  contention between the two brothers –Nawaz Sharif and Shehbaz Sharif –  after the former reportedly did not agree with the latter (president of  the party) to issue the MNA a show-cause notice for indirectly leveling  serious allegations against the younger Sharif and his cronies.  
“As a mark of protest Mr Shehbaz did not attend two back-to-back  divisional level meetings of the party in Lahore, which were also  attended by his elder brother (Nawaz),” a party insider privy to the  development told 
 on Thursday. Hamza Shehbaz also did not attend these meetings, supporting his father’s stance.  
The insider said Shehbaz might end his silent protest and attend next divisional level meetings on assurance of ‘some action’ against  Latif.   
“Shehbaz Sharif, the opposition leader in the National Assembly,  is very upset over Latif’s rant against him and his cronies. He wanted  to issue a show-cause notice (to Latif) for violating the party  discipline but Nawaz stopped him, asking him to wait for a while,” the  insider claimed, adding that since Shehbaz dared not challenge his elder  brother’s opinion, he chose to register a silent protest by not  attending the party meetings he was supposed to preside over.  
Javed Latif, who had come close to Maryam Nawaz after going to  jail, had told a private news channel that four to five leaders in the  PML-N were on an ‘assignment’.   
“These persons have been given the assignment to distort the  PML-N’s narrative (respect the ballot). Whenever the campaign against  the government reaches a decisive phase, one of them tries to defuse it.  Those on this are those who are talking about ‘reconciliation’. I don’t  want to name them but when seasoned leaders cause damage to the  narrative, this is not possible without an assignment (from the  establishment),” Latif had said and alleged that these four or five  leaders in the PML-N got assignments from those who did not believe in  law and the constitution. “These leaders must remember the fate of  Chaudhry Nisar,” Latif had warned.   
“This is simply outrageous. Latif thinks that he has got the  licence to take on Shehbaz and other senior leaders after securing the  blessings of Maryam Nawaz,” a senior leader considered to be from the  Shehbaz group said.   
“Latif should not only be served with a show cause but strict  action be taken against him for crossing the red line,” he suggested,  saying that Latif’s outburst against Shehbaz and others was at the  behest of someone in the top of the Nawaz and Maryam camp.  
Latif, an MNA from Sheikhupura district, was released from jail a  couple of months ago in a case of ‘inciting people against the state  institutions’.   
In a television programme, he had said his party would not say  “Pakistan Khappay” (Long Live Pakistan) if anything happened to its vice  president Maryam Nawaz.  
When contacted by 
, Malik Ahmad Khan, the newly  appointed spokesperson for Shehbaz Sharif, admitted that Mr Latif had  violated the party discipline.   
“The party president (Shehbaz) has taken a serious note of  Latif’s uncalled for comments and the power to issue a show-cause to him  (Latif) rests with him,” Mr Khan said.   
However, according to a news channel, PML-N vice president denied  the reports, urging the party workers not to pay attention to the  ‘propaganda by the enemy,’ saying Nawaz and Shehbaz ‘are one’.  
“This is a democratic party. Differences in opinion may exist.  This does not mean that one raises questions pertaining to party  leadership,” she said, addressing a gathering of workers from Bahawalpur  division. “When it comes to the party leadership, everyone agrees with  Nawaz Sharif as well as Shehbaz Sharif,” she said.

’s queries.

"LSM grows by modest 2.25pc in July
","September 16, 2021","ISLAMABAD: The Large Scale Manufacturing (LSM) grew by 2.25 per cent in July, reflecting a slowdown in industrial output, data released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) showed on Wednesday. 
The slowdown in the first month of the current financial year is in stark contrast compared to the previous few months when the industrial growth was in double digits with a claim of revival of industrial production after a slump because of a countrywide lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic. 
In the outgoing financial year, the LSM showed highest growth of 14.85pc and the government claimed that slums in industrial production has come to an end. 
On a month-on-month basis, the big industry production contracted by 4.91pc. 
Since July 2020, the LSM has rebounded after suffering months of a downturn on account of the Covid-19 pandemic, mainly in the automobile, construction, textile, food, chemicals, non-metallic mineral products and pharmaceutical sectors. 
The PBS snapshot of manufacturing activity showed that 11 out of 15 sub-sectors in the LSM rose in July. Low interest rates and reduction in duties on raw materials are expected to further spur economic activities during the current financial year. 
The production has witnessed increase in textile, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, automobiles, iron & steel products and fertilisers, while it decreased in non-metallic mineral products, and paper & board. 
Sector-wise, production of 11 items under the Oil Companies Advisory Committee fell by 3.57pc year-on-year in July. The 36 items under the Ministry of Industries and Production rose by 1.40pc, while 65 items reported by the provincial bureaus of statistics were up by 5.22pc. 
The LSM at 9.73pc of GDP dominates the overall manufacturing sector, accounting for 76.1pc of the sectoral share. It is followed by Small Scale Manufacturing which accounts for 2.12pc of total GDP and 16.6pc sectoral share. 
According to the Pakistan Economic Survey 2020-21, despite the issues raised in the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, the manufacturing sector remained sound and resilient during FY21 on the back of well in time government initiatives. 
It further said the government’s thoughtful decision to resume business activities and adoption of smart lockdowns boosted sentiments and the economy gained traction after witnessing a hefty decline in FY20. 
As per the PBS data, the entire automobile sector excluding buses showed strong growth in July 2021 compared to the same period from a year ago. Production of tractors rose by 38.35pc, trucks by 10.20pc, jeep and cars by 92.19pc, LCVs by 66.16pc and motorcycles by 8.22pc in July. However, the production of buses declined by 79.59pc. 
Cement output also dipped by 10.02pc in July despite the fact that there is a greater demand following the start of construction activities and increase in exports. In the steel sector, billets and ingots also posted a growth of 9.01pc. The production of paints and varnishes declined by 2.14pc and cigarettes by 13.71pc. 
In pharmaceuticals, the output of tablets dipped by 24.07pc, injection by 36.53pc, and capsules by 18.39pc. However, the output of syrups is up by 86.67pc.

"US Open victory yet to sink in for Raducanu
","September 16, 2021","LONDON: US Open champion Emma Raducanu said on Wednesday that her 
 at Flushing Meadows had yet to sink in and that the 18 months she took off from the sport provided her with the “hunger” to prevail in New York. 
The 18-year-old Briton stunned the tennis world by defeating Canada’s Leylah Fernandez in straight sets on Saturday to become the first qualifier to capture a Grand Slam title. 
Raducanu became Britain’s first Grand Slam champion in women’s singles since Virginia Wade in 1977 and did not drop a set during her run to the title in New York. 
“I feel great. Everything that’s happened in the last 72 hours has been so much fun... it still hasn’t really sunk in, but occasionally I’ll remember that I won the US Open. So yeah, a really funny feeling,” she told the WTA website. 
Raducanu took a break from tennis last year due to the pandemic and also because her parents insisted that she should complete her high school exams. 
“Having 18 months away... coming out you play every match like you don’t know when your last match will be. That was how I was approaching the whole summer... But the biggest thing is that I never once got ahead of myself,” she said. 
“For three weeks I just played the opponent in front of me, I took care of what I wanted to try and achieve on that day against that opponent, and just repeated it for three weeks.” 
Raducanu has made a string of public appearances since her win last weekend, the most high-profile being at the Met Gala in New York on Monday. 
The teenager called her red-carpet experience “eye-opening”, adding: “At the Met Gala everyone is so experienced and so accomplished in their own way and it was really cool to hear how they are and their perspective on things.” 
The new world number 23 shot to fame at Wimbledon earlier this year, reaching the fourth round in her first Grand Slam, and intends to have a short rest after a whirlwind two months. 
“I have a few days’ rest and recovery [coming up], I think needed after the last seven weeks,” she told American broadcaster CNBC on Tuesday. 
“But then I am straight back to training and hungry to get better and come back out and play some more tournaments.”

Factory’s owner Hassan Meetha alias Ali Meetha, its building’s owner Faisal Tariq, three supervisors — Syed Imran Ali Zaidi, Zafar and Rehan — and watchman Syed Zarin have been booked for their alleged involvement in the incident.
Police had first arrested the watchman and later Meetha, Tariq and Zaidi were also arrested after District and Sessions Judge (East) Khalid Hussain Shahani had revoked their interim pre-arrest bail granted to them on Aug 30 against a surety of Rs500,000 each.
On Wednesday, the investigating officer, Sub-inspector Izat Khan, submitted an interim investigation report before the judicial magistrate (East).
In the interim report, the IO mentioned that four suspects, including the owners of the factory and its building, were in judicial custody on remand. He added that two supervisors of the factory, Zafar and Rehan, were still absconding and efforts were under way to arrest them and produce before the court.
He informed the court that the DVR [digital video recorder] and nine bags full of samples of the evidence collected from the factory building had already been sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory of the University of Karachi and reports on the actual cause of the fire were still awaited.
IO Khan added that the relevant provincial government departments and civic agencies had already been included by widening the scope of the investigation into the incident.
He said that while dismissing the bail pleas of the owners, the judge had observed that “the authorities, who failed to discharge their functions include the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA), labour department and inspectors, deputy commissioner concerned, Karachi Development Authority (KDA) and Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (Civil Defence Department). These all are responsible for the offence and ought to be implicated, investigated and taken to the task for the alleged crime”. 
In light of the court’s observations, the IO said he had issued summons to the relevant officers/officials of K-Electric, SBCA, Sindh Civil Defence, Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan, the KDA, Anti-Encroachment Cell, the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board, fire brigade and Sui Southern Gas Company Limited.
Issuing letters under Sections 160 (police officer’s power to require attendance of witnesses) and 94 (summons to produce documents or other things) of the Criminal Procedure Code, the IO said he had summoned the officers/officials of these departments and agencies along with their respective reports with regard to action, if any, taken against the owners of BM Luggage (Pvt) Limited for running commercial activity in a structure officially approved for residential usage.
He further said that the fire department had particularly been asked to submit a report, replying to queries about the reporting of the fire incident, timing of their response and whether the blaze was caused by an electric short-circuit or gas leakage, etc.
He submitted that no reply had so far been received from any of these departments and agencies, adding that it was expected that they would respond in this week. Therefore, he requested the court to accept the interim investigation report and grant time for filing the final one.
While accepting the interim report, the judge granted time to the IO for filing final investigation report till Sept 18.
A case was registered under Sections 322 (manslaughter) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code at the Korangi Industrial Area police station.",Pakistan
"Flour price set to rocket in Punjab amid high wheat price
","September 16, 2021","LAHORE: With the federal government hinting, and the Punjab most probably following, at wheat release price of Rs1,950 per 40kg, the flour price is set to increase by a staggering 22.73 per cent – from the current official price of Rs860 per 20 kilo to Rs1,100.  
The new flour price, however, will be 10.57 per cent less than the current market price which had hit Rs1,230 per 20kg because of an exceptional increase in wheat price during the last six weeks: wheat hit at the rate of Rs2,200 per 40kg.  
However, if the last official price is something to go by, the increase per 20kg bag will be Rs240. Last year, Punjab had a release price of Rs1,475 per 40kg and had allowed millers to sell a 20kg bag at Rs860 after adding grinding charges of Rs105 per bag. The newly announced price of Rs1,950 per 40kg (or 24.36pc more) is bound to reflect in new price: Rs975 wheat charges, Rs105 grinding charges and Rs20 transportation charges and profit margin) and a market price of around Rs1,100 per 40kg.  
“The Punjab had also recommended the same price which Special Assistant to Prime Minister Jamshaid Iqbal Cheema hinted at on Wednesday,” claims an official of the Provincial Food Department.  
The next crucial decision, which the department now has to take, is the release date. The decision on both issues (release price and date) has to be taken by the provincial cabinet and the department has already moved a summary in this regard and a decision should come by the end of this, or early next, week. The supply side situation, he said, is still easy.
“So, the food department can wait for a week or two. However, the final word will come from the cabinet,” he said.  
“Yes, there is no supply panic. The millers are holding stocks of around one million tonnes: 850,000 tonnes of declared ones and some undeclared for trading purposes. The department itself houses around four million tonnes and three million tonnes is being imported by the federal government; of which one million tonnes will be coming to Punjab in case of need,” explains a miller from the city.  
“The total availability will thus be around 5.8 million tonnes. It is the same quantity that was available to the province last year. Thus everyone should stay comfortable as far as domestic requirement and arability is concerned. However, drainage to Afghanistan is a question mark,” claims Muhammad Ramzan, a trader from the city.  
Afghans are left on their own this year and there would neither be American nor Indian food help coming to them. There only fallback would be Pakistan.  
“Pakistan can have import for export policy, to begin with. It means allowing millers to import as much wheat as they want to send to Afghanistan. At the later stage (may be by November or December), Pakistan can allow flour export to Afghanistan if its stocks allow. But, it should not take eyes off the Afghan market because it can create pressure, in otherwise comfortable Pakistani market, he advises.  
Justifying the new price, SAPM Cheema insisted: “In India, each kilo of flour costs Rs61, it is Rs75 in Bangladesh. Even after the increase, per kilo price in Pakistan will be Rs55 per kilo.”  
He said this while addressing a press conference here on Wednesday.",Pakistan
"Zakir Jaffer’s name was not in FIR registered on July 20: counsel
","September 16, 2021","ISLAMABAD: The defence counsel in Noor Mukadam murder case claimed that his client Zakir Jaffer, father of Zahir Jaffer, was taken into custody despite the fact that he was not nominated as accused in the FIR registered on July 20 and even he was not present in the city on that day.
Khawja Haris, counsel for Zakir Jaffer, on Wednesday while reading the FIR before the Islamabad High Court (IHC) Justice Aamer Farooq said that parents of Zahir Jaffer had no role in Noor Mukadam’s murder as they were in Karachi. Zakir even condemned the incident, he added.
He informed the court that police arrested Zakir and his spouse Asmat Adamjee on July 24.
According to the counsel, the FIR was registered on murder charges. However, the police added offences of concealing of evidence and abetment later on.
Justice Farooq inquired whether the charge-sheet in this case had been submitted in the trial court.
Shah Khawar, counsel for Shaukat Mukadam, father of Noor Mukadam, told the court that the charge-sheet had been submitted before the trial court adding that the police had accused Zakir Jaffer of abetting in the crime.
The police challan claimed that on July 20, Zahir Jaffer and Noor went into brawl after the latter refused to marry him and then the accused illegally detained her in the room.
Referring to the Call Detail Record (CDR), the challan stated that before killing and beheading Noor, Zahir made at least four calls to her parents at 2:21pm, 3pm, 6:35pm and 7:29pm. “Noor Mukadam’s murder could have been averted had Zahir Jaffer timely informed the police”, it said.
The challan said in order to conceal the evidence and the body of Noor, Zakir Jaffer sent five Therapyworks  employees to his F-7/4 residence - the crime scene of gruesome murder. When the Therapyworks employees tried to enter the room, Zahir got confused and attacked them. One worker Amjad Mehmood got injured and shifted to the hospital. The injured worker lied to the hospital administration and gave road accident as the reason of his injury.
According to the challan, the parents and the Therapyworks employees tried to conceal the crime and attempted to destroy the evidence.
Advocate Haris argued that the addition of sections of the Pakistan Penal Code related to concealing/destroying evidence and abetment was an afterthought as police added the offences two days after the registration of the FIR.
The court then adjourned the haring till Thursday (today). The defence counsel would continue arguments on Thursday.",Pakistan
"Heavy Electrical Complex workers without salary for two months

According to the employees, they have been facing financial problems as the HEC management has not paid them salaries of two months. 
“I have been buying grocery items on credit, but the local shopkeeper has stopped the routine supply to my family as I failed to pay him the pending amount,” Namroz Khan, a worker, told this correspondent. He said he might not be able to pay his gas and electricity bills if the situation persisted. 
According to sources in the office of deputy director labour, Hazara division, the labor officer, Haripur, visited the HEC on Aug 31 following workers’ complaints and after confirmation of nonpayment of salaries filed a case with the local labour court. 
Through the formal litigation, the labour officer argued that nonpayment of salaries was a violation of section 3 of the KP Payment of Wages Act, 2013, and the administration was liable to be punished under section 20 (1) of the same law. 
The labour officer, according to a letter written to the factory management on August 26, asked for payment of salaries.

"Ashraf Ghani’s abrupt exit scuttled deal on power-sharing, says Zalmay Khalilzad
","September 16, 2021","WASHINGTON: Former president Ashraf Ghani’s abrupt exit last month scuttled a deal under which the Taliban would hold off entering Kabul and negotiate a political transition, the US negotiator on Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
In his first interview since the collapse of the 20-year Western-backed government, Zalmay Khalilzad, who brokered a deal with the Taliban last year to withdraw US troops, told the 
 that the insurgents had agreed to stay outside the capital for two weeks and shape a future government.
“Even at the end, we had an agreement with the Talibs for (them) not to enter Kabul,” he told the newspaper in the interview.
But Ghani fled on Aug 15 and the Taliban, in a previously arranged meeting that day with Gen Frank McKenzie, chief of Central Command, asked if US troops would ensure security for Kabul as government authority crumbled.
“And then you know what happened, we weren’t going to take responsibility,” Khalilzad said.
President Joe Biden had insisted that US troops would only work to evacuate Americans and Afghan allies and not extend America’s longest war. Asked about Khalilzad’s remarks, State Department spokesman Ned Price said it was not an option to stay “a moment longer” in Kabul.
“There was never a realistic, there was never a viable, there was never a practical option for the United States to stay,” Price told reporters.
“We were left with a very clear and stark impression that if the United States sought to prolong our presence on the ground, our service members... would again be targets of Taliban violence, not to mention terrorist attacks by groups like IS (the militant Islamic State group).”",Newspaper
"Macron meets key Gulf ally Abu Dhabi crown prince in historic chateau
","September 16, 2021","			
FONTAINEBLEAU: French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday held talks with the crown prince of the UAE’s Abu Dhabi, Mohammed bin Zayed, one of Paris’ closest allies in the Middle East region.
The two met for a working lunch at the historic Fontainebleau Chateau outside Paris, where the United Arab Emirates has played a key role in restoration works, correspondents said.
France has close military, political and cultural ties to the UAE. Abu Dhabi has in the last month served as a hub for the evacuation by Paris of French nationals and Afghans from Taliban-controlled Afghanistan.
Macron also has a strong personal relationship with Mohammed bin Zayed, known as MBZ, who is seen as one of the most powerful figures in the Gulf, along with his close ally Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as MBS.
Analysts believe Macron and MBZ are united by a shared distrust of political Islam and particularly activities of Islamist political parties such as the Muslim Brotherhood in the Middle East.
They also both have thorny relations with Turkey under its strongman President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, even if there have been signs of a thaw in ties between Ankara and the UAE and Paris over the last weeks.
“The discussion will focus on the strategic partnership between the two countries and on all regional issues,” the Elysee said in a brief statement ahead of the talks.
They were also to visit the historic theatre at the Fontainebleau Palace built between 1853 and 1856 under the nephew of emperor Napoleon I, Napoleon III, which has been painstakingly restored thanks to UEA funding.",Newspaper
"Afghan Taliban leader Abdul Ghani Baradar among Time's 100 most influential people of 2021
","September 16, 2021","Abdul Ghani Baradar, the Taliban co-founder and now deputy prime minister of Afghanistan, has been named among the 
 of 2021 by 
 magazine.
Baradar's profile for Time's list, written by veteran journalist Ahmed Rashid, noted that he ""is revered"" among the Afghan Taliban as a founding member, ""a charismatic military leader and a deeply pious figure"".
It said that when the Taliban took over the Afghan capital in August, it was on the terms negotiated by Baradar, which included amnesties offered, the lack of bloodshed upon seizing power and contacts and visits with neighbouring states such as Pakistan and China.
""A quiet, secretive man who rarely gives public statements or interviews, Baradar nonetheless represents a more moderate current within the Taliban, the one that will be thrust into the limelight to win Western support and desperately needed financial aid. The question is whether the man who coaxed the Americans out of Afghanistan can sway his own movement,"" the profile said.
			
Baradar was once a close friend of the movement's reclusive first leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar, who gave him his nom de guerre, ""Baradar"" or ""brother"". 
Following the fall of the Taliban government in 2001, Baradar served as a senior military commander responsible for attacks on coalition forces, a UN sanctions notice said.
He was arrested and imprisoned in Pakistan in 2010. After his release in 2018, he headed the Taliban's political office in Doha, becoming one of the most prominent figures in peace talks with the United States.
Baradar appears to be the first Taliban leader to make it to the list, although the publication has made no such mention in its write-up. The full list can be viewed

Also included in this year's list is Afghan women's rights activist Mahbouba Seraj, US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, Chinese President Xi Jinping, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, former US president Donald Trump and Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi.

"CPEC hasn’t slowed down, assures Asad Umar
","September 18, 2021","ISLAMABAD: Planning and Development Minister Asad Umar on Friday said security threats had increased in the country because of opposition by international powers to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and the latest situation in Afghanistan.  
“Security threat is elevated,” he said in response to a question at a hurriedly called news conference, adding that no doubt development on CPEC was looked upon with aversion by big global powers who wanted to sow dissension in the country. The challenges are also there because of the uncertain Afghan situation. “So there are not only security challenges, but these are at an elevated level,” he said.  
However, Mr Umar said, the entire leadership led by the prime minister and also including the army chief and other security high-ups had taken effective steps that had also been shared with the Chinese leadership who had expressed confidence in the additional security arrangements.  
In such situations politicians ought to be careful while commenting on CPEC, he said, adding that there was no bar on criticism and recommendations but it should not be described like “closed down, finished or destroyed”.  
The minister was referring to the observations by chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Planning Salim Mandviwala who recently said the Chinese ambassador and companies had complained about slow pace of work on CPEC projects.  
Without naming Mr Mandviwala, the minister said he was a seasoned person and could not be expected of speaking irresponsibly but perhaps he had been misled. He said he expected that the Chinese embassy would also be issuing something explanatory to the media.  
Mr Umar rejected a perception that CPEC had been slowed down over the past three years and claimed the major work on the corridor projects had been completed during the tenure of the current PTI government.  
In the first phase of CPEC, power and infrastructure were the two major sectors of focus and power projects of 3340MW were completed by the previous government, while 5864MW projects were being completed by the current government. On top, work on another 1824MW projects had also been started recently and these would be completed after the tenure of the current government.  
In infrastructure and road sector, the minister said, the PML-N government had completed 394km-long motorways and highways under CPEC, while the current government had so far completed 413km of motorways and highways.  
He said the PML-N government had totally ignored the western corridor that was at the heart of CPEC. He said Gwadar-Hoshab road was completed by the previous government which had also initiated Hakla-D.I. Khan motorway and completed 42 per cent of work, while the rest of 56pc was completed by the current government. Other than these two projects, the previous government could not take to initial approval stage any of the road projects on the western alignment.  
The planning minister said the D.I. Khan-Zhob road (210km) project had been approved and a loan application submitted while negotiations for the loan were in process. Similarly, the contractor of the Zhob-Quetta road project had been mobilised and PC-1 of Quetta-Khuzdar road approved, while funding for this project had already been allocated in the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) 2021-22.  
Mr Umar said the current government had completed 67pc work on 10km Khuzda-Basima road and would soon complete the rest of work. Likewise, he said, the 146km Hoshab-Awaran road project had also been approved and the contractor had been mobilised. The project is an integral part of the CPEC central alignment that connects the port city of Gwadar with Sindh.  
“In fact, real work on western corridor of CPEC has been started by our [PTI] government,” he said, adding that instead of waiting for the Chinese loans the government has started work on the projects from its own resources under the PSDP.  
Moreover, the government is also starting work on the connecting roads to the western alignment. The Peshawar-D.I. Khan motorway project is one of such projects which has recently been approved. Similarly, the 460km Karachi-Quetta-Chaman road project has also been approved and one of the portions will be completed by the government itself while the other sections would be constructed under the public-private partnership.  
Likewise, the government has also accorded approval to other such projects such as Nokundi-Mashkel road, Mashkel-Panjgur road and Awaran-Jhal Jhao road. The minister said these connecting roads and the western alignment were being built to take maximum benefit of the opportunities to be open up in Afghanistan after peace and stability prevailed there.  
Asad Umar said that after completion of the first phase, “we are entering the second but very important phase of CPEC under which investment would come to a range of sectors, including industrialisation, agriculture, livestock, science and technology and other social sector development sectors”. He said the present government had also taken three industrial zones to operational stage.",Pakistan
"World’s largest tree wrapped in foil to protect it from forest fires
","September 18, 2021","			
LOS ANGELES: The world’s biggest trees were being wrapped in fire-proof blankets on Thursday in an effort to protect them from huge blazes tearing through the drought-stricken western United States. 
A grove of ancient sequoias, including the 275-foot General Sherman Tree — the largest in the world — were getting aluminum cladding to fend off the flames. 
Firefighters were also clearing brush and pre-positioning engines among the 2,000 ancient trees in California’s Sequoia National Park, incident commanders said. 
“They are taking extraordinary measures to protect these trees,” said park resource manager Christy Brigham, according to 
. 
“We just really want to do everything we can to protect these 2,000- and 3,000-year-old trees.” Millions of acres of California’s forests have burned in this year’s ferocious fire season. 
Scientists say man-made global warming is behind the years-long drought and rising temperatures that have left the region highly vulnerable to wildfires. 
On Thursday, two fires were looming down on the park’s Giant Forest, home to five of the world’s largest trees, including the General Sherman. 
Around 500 personnel were engaged in battling the Paradise Fire and the Colony Fire, which together have already consumed 9,365 acres of woodland since they erupted from lightning strikes on September 10. 
The enormous trees of the Giant Forest are a huge tourist draw, with visitors travelling from all over the world to marvel at their imposing height and extraordinary girth. 
While not the tallest trees — California redwoods can grow to more than 300 feet — the giant sequoias are the largest by volume. 
Smaller fires generally do not harm the sequoias, which are protected by a thick bark, and actually help them to reproduce; the heat they generate opens cones to release seeds. 
But the larger, hotter blazes that are laying waste to the western United States are dangerous to them because they climb higher up the trunks and into the canopy.",Newspaper

"Former players back Sharma to replace Kohli as India’s T20 captain
","September 18, 2021","NEW DELHI: Opener Rohit Sharma has demonstrated his leadership qualities in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and is an obvious choice to succeed Virat Kohli as India’s Twenty20 captain, according to several former players.
Kohli, who has led India across formats, has decided to relinquish Twenty20 captaincy after the 20-overs World Cup scheduled in the United Arab Emirates and Oman from Oct 17.
Kohli has a 27-14 win-loss ratio as India’s Twenty20 captain, while his Royal Challengers Bangalore team continue to chase their maiden IPL title.
While the Indian cricket board is not in any hurry to name a successor now, Rohit, IPL’s most successful captain, is likely to be elevated as India’s Twenty20 skipper.
For former India captain Dilip Veng­sarkar, it is a no-brainer.
“Rohit deserves to be India’s next T20 captain because he has done well whenever he’s been given an opportunity to lead India,” Vengsarkar told 
 newspaper on Friday.
“In 2018, India won the Asia Cup under his captaincy. Beside that, he’s been an exceptional captain for the Mumbai Indians, having led them to five IPL titles.”
Former player Sandeep Patil also backed IPL’s most successful captain for the job.
“Rohit has proved his mettle,” Patil, part of India’s 1983 World Cup winning squad, told the same newspaper.
Kohli cited his  “immense” workload as the reason behind his decision but Indian cricket board president Sourav Ganguly said the decision was made  “keeping in mind the future roadmap.”

"Shehbaz’s ‘protest’ makes Nawaz serve notice on PML-N leader Javed Latif
","September 18, 2021","LAHORE: Finally, after the ‘silent’ protest by Shehbaz Sharif, MNA Javed Latif has been issued a show-cause notice on the direction of former premier Nawaz Sharif for indirectly criticising PML-N president and some other party leaders considered close to him.
PML-N secretary general Ahsan Iqbal on Friday served the show-cause notice on Latif.
“It has come to the notice of the party Quaid that you (Javed Latif) appeared on a talk show on Sept 14 in which you made certain comments and allegations that were baseless and violative of the party discipline. Quaid is proud of all his colleagues who have stood shoulder to shoulder with him over decades. The party remains united despite the worst conspiracies hatched against it by anti-democratic forces. The recent victory in the cantonment boards’ election is a testament of our unity and steadfastness which enjoys popular support of the people,” reads the notice. 
It further says: “Whereas PML-N has the tradition of allowing maximum space to its members to express their opinions within the party in the spirit of true democracy, at the same time the tone and tenor in public discourse no matter whosoever it comes from, which includes discussions in TV talk shows, that violates the very ethics and discipline of the party is intolerable. I am directed by Nawaz Sharif to issue this show-cause notice to you [Latif] and you are called upon to show cause as to why disciplinary action should not be taken against you. Respond to this notice within seven days.” 
A party leader told 
 that Mr Latif was now given two options – either seek unconditional apology from Shehbaz Sharif or resign as party MNA.
“The boycott of two back-to-back divisional level meetings of the party in Lahore this week by Mr Shehbaz over not issuing a show-cause notice to Latif finally bears fruit as Nawaz Sharif realised the sensitivity of the matter and took a corrective measure,” he said and added that the episode was a set back to the Maryam Nawaz camp as well.
Shehbaz Sharif, the opposition leader in the National Assembly, was reportedly very upset over Latif’s rant against him and his fellow party leaders and took it as his ‘insult’.
Javed Latif, who had become a confidant of the party vice-president Maryam Nawaz after being jailed, had told a private news channel on Sept 14 that four to five leaders in the PML-N were on an ‘assignment’ to distort the party’s narrative [respect the ballot].
Indirectly referring to Shehbaz, who advocates the narrative of reconciliation [with establishment], Latif said “those who are on an assignment talk about reconciliation. I don’t want to name them but when seasoned leaders cause damage to the [party’s] narrative, this is not possible without an assignment [from the establishment].”
On Friday, Javed Latif claimed while talking to a news channel that he knew how Nawaz Sharif was convinced to serve a notice on him as he (Nawaz) was not ready to do so.  
“I know how Nawaz Sharif was persuaded to issue a show cause notice to me. However, I am even ready to resign if asked,” he said and added that he had ‘friendship’ with Shehbaz but he stood by his words that some leaders in the PML-N were causing harm to Nawaz Sharif’s narrative.  
Latif also claimed that some leaders in the party meetings had spoken against Nawaz’s narrative. 
This is not an isolated episode, as earlier this month Shehbaz Sharif cut a sorry figure after the party issued a clarification on his statement regarding his idea of ‘national government’ terming it his personal opinion.  
Talking to reporters at the Lahore Press Club, PML-N president Rana Sanaullah said it was wrong to say that anyone in the PML-N was on ‘assignment’.  
“If someone is on ‘assignment’ he cannot remain in the party,” he said.",Pakistan

The Privatisation Commission which is arranging roadshows since Sept 13, says the revival of Pakistan Steel Mills would be a unique transaction as since its closure various attempts have been made to revive it.
It said this was the first time after 16 years that the Ministry of Privatisation was making unrelenting efforts, and the transaction is expected to be completed in the second quarter of next year.
The Privatisation Commission says investors’ consortium from South Korea and China held meetings with the team of the commission led by Minister for Privatisation Mohammadmian Soomro on Friday. 
Financial and legal advisers and senior officials of the ministry responded to the queries from the potential investors.
Mr Soomro reiterated that the government will welcome foreign investors in Pakistan and will provide all possible facilities to investors. The revival of Pakistan Steel Mills and its functioning in its full capacity is the prime focus of the whole process.
Its revival would augur well for the economy of the country by fulfilling the indigenous demand for iron and steel, which is currently imported from China, Germany and Japan, he said.",Pakistan
"PM Imran says dialogue initiated with Taliban for inclusive Afghan government
","September 18, 2021","Prime Minister Imran Khan on Saturday that he has initiated a dialogue with the Taliban for the formation of an inclusive government in Afghanistan representing multiple ethnic groups. 
The statement by the premier came in a tweet after the conclusion of the 20th Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Council of Heads of State (SCO-CHS) 
, where regional leaders, including PM Imran, met to discuss the situation in Afghanistan following the US withdrawal from the war-torn country. 
""After meetings in Dushanbe with leaders of Afghanistan's neighbours and especially a lengthy discussion with Tajikistan's President Emomali Rahmon, I have initiated a dialogue with the Taliban for an inclusive Afghan government to include Tajiks, Hazaras and Uzbeks,"" he tweeted.
			
In a subsequent tweet, he added: ""After 40 years of conflict, this inclusivity will ensure peace and a stable Afghanistan, which is in the interest not only of Afghanistan but the region as well.""
			
Pakistan has been stressing the need for an inclusive government in Afghanistan since the Taliban 
 the country and announced an [interim government][3.
The prime minister had 
 the same during his address at the SCO-CHS summit on Friday. 
""The Taliban must fulfil the pledges made, above all for an inclusive political structure where all ethnic groups are represented. This is vital for Afghanistan’s stability,"" he had said, adding that it was also important to ensure respect for the rights of all Afghans while making certain that the country will never again be made a safe haven for terrorists.
Other leaders at the conference had 
, pointing out that Afghanistan’s new interim cabinet almost exclusively comprised ethnic Pashtuns, the group's main support base. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin, who had spoken via a video link, noted that the new provisional government could not be called representative or inclusive, “as we do not see representatives of other ethnic groups there. But we believe we need to work with it.”
Similarly, Chinese President Xi Jinping had said it was necessary to “encourage Afghanistan to put in place a broad-based and inclusive political framework” and to “resolutely fight all forms of terrorism” and live in peace with its neighbours. 
He was of the opinion that Afghanistan should be guided to be more open and inclusive, and pursue moderate domestic and foreign policies.
The Afghan Taliban had announced an interim government, comprising 33 members, earlier this month.
Prior to that, they had 
 an ""inclusive"" government that represents Afghanistan's complex ethnic makeup.
However, the current structure mainly comprises Pashtuns, who form less than half of Afghanistan’s population, and there is no participation of women yet in the interim setup.",Pakistan
"Biden faced ‘unfair criticism’ over Afghanistan troop withdrawal: PM Imran
","September 18, 2021","Prime Minister Imran Khan said he believed US President Joe Biden was targeted with ""unfair criticism"" over 
 from Afghanistan, terming his decision to pull out troops “the most sensible thing to do.”
In an interview with Russian broadcaster 
, the premier referred to former Afghan president Ashraf Ghani 
 the country and the army surrendering a week before departure of foreign forces.
""How can you prepare for that?” he asked.
""So there was so much unfair 
 of President Biden, and what he did was the most sensible thing to do,"" said PM Imran while commending the US president for his decision.
When asked about the kind of relationship he had with Biden, Imran said his government had ties with the US. ""Our security chiefs keep exchanging views about Afghanistan,"" he added.
 
 
The prime minister also said he wasn't sure whether the US had any coherent policy on what they were going to do in the war-ravaged country.
He also called upon the United States to devise a strategy if a humanitarian crisis broke out triggered by a feared halt in international help to Afghanistan. 
""There will be far-reaching consequences in terms of the refugee problem, which Pakistan and Iran will feel more as they have taken more number of 
,"" he cautioned.
The premier stressed the US had a big role to play, as it was there [in Afghanistan] for 20 years. 
The only reason the US invaded Afghanistan, he said, was terrorism. 
""What would be the achievement if Afghan soil becomes a place for terrorists again. We should not let Afghanistan drift towards another crisis,"" emphasised the PM.
The premier said he was deeply hurt by the remarks of US senators against Pakistan over the Afghan debacle.
""Pakistan is the country that gave the greatest number of sacrifices for the US in its war,"" PM Imran said.
“We were asked to become part of this coalition when Pakistan had nothing to do with 9/11 as there wasn't any Pakistani involved. We had no reason to enter the war.""
He said it was painful to see the US making Pakistan a scapegoat for its failures.
PM Imran also dispelled the impression that Pakistan allegedly helped the Taliban in the fight against US forces.
“If we believe this is the case, it means Pakistan is stronger than the US and the whole of the Europeans.""
He said it was all propaganda by the ""puppet"" Afghan government led by Ashraf Ghani to cover up its ""incompetence, corruption and inability"" to govern the country.
He also called out India for sponsoring propaganda to defame Pakistan, saying Delhi had heavily 
 in Afghanistan for its nefarious designs. 
The prime minister underlined that Pakistan was working with all neighbours of Afghanistan on a mechanism to recognise the Taliban government. He stressed upon the new Afghan rulers to form an inclusive government, which he said was a key to long-term stability in the country.
According to him, ""There are people within the Taliban who feel the government will remain unstable unless they get all other minorities under the umbrella.""
PM Imran noted that the Taliban were a reality now and the world didn't have a choice except to incentivise them for a stable country.
""The international community must encourage them to walk this path and hopefully it will lead to peace.""
He warned that Afghanistan will collapse if the world put sanctions on it. ""Around 75 per cent of the country's budget is through aid, and if this monetary assistance is stopped, the country will fall.""",World
"Quorum becomes order of day for National Assembly
","September 25, 2021","ISLAMABAD: Quorum has become an order of the day for the National Assembly as Friday was the fifth consecutive day when the chair adjourned the sitting without taking up any agenda item after an opposition member pointed out lack of quorum soon after recitation from the Holy Quran and playing of the national anthem. 
A minority member of the main opposition Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), Kesoo Mal Kheeal Das, mentioned the lack of quorum as soon as Deputy Speaker Qasim Suri declared start of the Question Hour. 
Mr Suri ordered a headcount of members and later adjourned the sitting till Monday afternoon. 
When Mr Das was pointing out lack of quorum, for which the presence of 86 members (one-fourth) of the 342-member house is required, his other colleagues on the opposition benches had started leaving the house for the lobby without giving any reason for their walkout. 
The quorum issue has been haunting the National Assembly for quite some time, but since the start of the fourth parliamentary year last month, the issue has acquired the form of a serious issue. Interestingly, so far, there has been no official word either from the speaker or the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) over the issue despite constant criticism from the opposition as well as from outside over the failure of the government to ensure quorum in the assembly. 
Article 55(2) of the Constitution under the title “Voting in Assembly and quorum” reads: “If at any time during the sitting of the National Assembly the attention of the person presiding is drawn to the fact that less than one-fourth of the total membership of the Assembly is present, he shall either adjourn the Assembly or suspend the session until at least one-fourth of such membership is present.” 
Many political and constitutional experts believe that pointing out quorum during the routine discussion and Question Hour is a misuse of the constitutional provision as quorum can only be pointed out during voting on some important issue. According to them, the spirit of this provision is to ensure maximum participation of members while doing legislation as Article 55(1) says that “all decisions of the National Assembly shall be taken by majority of the members present and voting”. 
Muddasir Rizvi, an official of the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen), said there was a need to revisit the rules and the constitutional provision with regard to the quorum to prevent its misuse. 
He pointed out that such a provision was available in constitutions and rules of almost all parliaments in the world, but it was used very selectively. 
PPP information secretary Shazia Atta Marri said in a statement that it seemed that PTI members were displeased over the bad governance of the ruling party as the government had failed to complete the quorum of the National Assembly. 
Ms Marri said that even now the PTI members were not ready to support this “government of liars”. 
She said unemployed and inflation-hit people’s level of patience had been running out while the ruling party’s members had also been fed up by hearing the same speeches of Prime Minister Imran Khan for three years.",Pakistan
"Owen defends biennial World Cup proposal, says it’s about inclusivity
","September 25, 2021","			
 
Then just an 18-year-old, on as a substitute in England’s second World Cup group game against Romania — in a game his side would eventually go on to lose — he became his country’s youngest goal-scorer at a World Cup; a record that stands to this day. 
It was against Argentina though, in a round-of-16 match that England would also go on to lose, where he showed the full repertoire of his skills — pace, acceleration and lethal finishing. 
Owen took in his stride a through ball from David Beckham — whose red card later on would ultimately decide the contest in Saint Etienne — and left Jose Antonio Chamot trailing in his wake before going past Roberto Ayala and planting a perfect finish. 
Inevitably, there were comparisons to a player who was the best at that time: Brazilian phenomenon Ronaldo, the star of that World Cup and three years his senior. 
Ronaldo also suffered heartbreak at that World Cup as Brazil lost the final to France, although he would eventually get redemption four years later by lifting the Selecao’s fifth world title. 
That title eluded Owen but both his and Ronaldo’s careers followed a similar trajectory; peaking early on, winning the Ballon d’Or in their early twenties, before injuries slowed them down. 
They played together too, for a season at Real Madrid. 
And now both are behind FIFA’s plan to change the scheduling of the tournament that defined their careers. 
Owen and Ronaldo were part of the FIFA Legends panel which held meetings with FIFA’s global football development director Arsene Wenger in Qatar earlier this month, where consultations were held about making the World Cup a biennial event despite widespread uproar that it would not only devalue the standing of the tournament but also have an impact on the club game. 
Ronaldo said after that meeting that a World Cup every two years “would be a great opportunity to engage the youth that may be going into different areas.” 
Owen, though, is of the view that the plan is about inclusivity, about seeing newer countries qualify. 
“A 100 percent,” the former Liverpool and Manchester United striker told 
 when asked whether the plan would actually help develop the game globally during a Zoom interview on Friday morning after he was 
 the brand ambassador for the upcoming Pakistan Football League, a six-team franchise event set to be launched by the end of the year. 
“The main point on the agenda, the reasoning for having a World Cup every two years is to have more inclusion, more involvement from so many more countries,” he added. “It seems the same countries are playing every four years. Football is a game for all the people all over the world.” 
FIFA has already expanded the World Cup to 48 teams from 32, increasing slots for each continent starting from the 2026 edition. The long-drawn qualifying for the World Cup sees participation from almost every country in the world but Owen believes that actually playing at the tournament makes the difference. 
“FIFA is really trying to push for other countries to be able to be included and just compete at that much higher level on a frequent basis so it will certainly improve the level of football around the world,” he said. “So that’s a definite positive from that point of view. It will also see more meaningful matches.” 
Owen said a possible change in World Cup scheduling, along with the launch of the PFL, gives Pakistan football something to look forward too. 
Pakistan has never won a World Cup qualifier in its history and football remains mired in crisis with the country currently suspended by FIFA. 
The PFL is being launched after Global Soccer Ventures signed an agreement with the court-elected Pakistan Football Federation, which is not recognised by the game’s global body, to develop Pakistan football. 
“It will be a natural progression, a natural improvement just because football is out there and that it’s being played,” said Owen. “There will be children watching this. It’s going to increase the popularity so quite inevitably there will be improvement in the standard. 
“We’re not naive to think it will happen overnight. We have seen so many leagues over the world which enhance the [playing] standard [of a country] if they’re done well and done sustainably. There is no reason why in a country of Pakistan’s power and numbers the standard of football cannot improve rapidly.” 
Following his exploits at the World Cup in France, Owen came back from a dreadful hamstring injury to win the Ballon d’Or in 2001 after helping Liverpool to five trophies that year including the treble of the UEFA Cup, FA Cup and the League Cup. 
Further injuries, though, meant Owen was unable to achieve greater heights, although he did win the Premier League with Manchester United in 2011 as a bit-part player. 
“You look behind and you see the Ballon d’Or,” said Owen, sitting in front of his trophy cabinet during the interview, “and obviously that means you were at the top of the tree at one specific point. I know if I hadn’t had injuries in my career, I would’ve had a bigger trophy cabinet. 
“Injuries affected Ronaldo too,” he added of the Brazilian who came back from a horrific knee injury to win the World Cup in 2002. “As a player growing up, I was looking at him and admiring him so to play alongside later on in my career was very special.” 
The injuries that affected both Ronaldo and Owen meant they both had to alter their similar playing styles. The tearing pace and the searing acceleration that made them so special were gone when they played together at Real. 
“Of course you cant’t help if you have injuries and you try to come fitter and stronger than when you left the field in the first place,” Owen said.
“Of course you have regrets. I burst onto the scene very quickly. I achieved a lot very quickly in the first four or five years of my career. 
“I got goals, broke records. The only sad thing from my point of view was that I couldn’t sustain that for the second half of my career. But it’s also a [matter of] pride that I was playing at the same level and despite all those injuries and managed to sustain and almost change my game to be a different type of player.” 
As soon as Owen’s interview ended, the European Club Association released a statement slamming FIFA for trying to “railroad through plans for biennial World Cups”, adding that the approach to the reforms of the international match calendar were in “direct and unilateral breach of certain legal obligations”, as it joined European football’s governing body UEFA in opposing the proposals. 
On Friday evening, FIFA released a video of former France striker David Trezeguet, a World Cup winner with France in 1998, reiterating Owen’s view that changing the way World Cups are held will eliminate matches of lower of importance and that the quality and global competitiveness will grow. 
The former players have said that more World Cups will ensure future stars of the game get greater chances to win the game’s biggest prize. 
But even that stirs quite a debate. 
Ronaldo won it twice in four appearances, after being an unused substitute in Brazil’s 1994 title-winning campaign. Trezeguet won it once in three tournaments. 
Owen played in three tournaments but never got close. That is precisely what makes the World Cup in its current format so special.",Newspaper
"UK seeks smoother waters with France after subs row
","September 25, 2021","LONDON: Britain on Friday sought to turn a page with France following a cross-continental diplomatic crisis centred on alleged deceit over a submarine contract with Australia. 
French President Emmanuel Macron was left furious last week after Australia ditched a mega-deal to buy diesel submarines from France in favour of nuclear-powered US ones, under an agreement secured during secret talks facilitated by Britain. 
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson reached out to Macron for a telephone call on Friday after Paris accused its UK, US and Australian allies of a “stab in the back” over the deal and dismissed London as a “junior partner” to Washington. 
Johnson and Macron “reaffirmed the importance of the UK-France relationship and agreed to continue working closely together around the world on our shared agenda, through Nato and bilaterally”, Downing Street said in a statement. 
They also noted the “strategic significance” of UK-French cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region and sub-Saharan Africa, it said. 
They agreed to “intensify cooperation” against cross-Channel people-smugglers, and to stay in contact over post-Brexit fisheries licences and trading arrangements for Northern Ireland. 
The contract for nuclear submarines that sparked the diplomatic crisis forms the centrepiece of a new strategic alliance involving Australia, Britain and the United States known as AUKUS, which is widely seen as an attempt to counter China in the Indo-Pacific. 
France and other Nato allies are not in the mix, although the AUKUS trio have stressed it is not meant to be exclusionary. 
In a terse account of the Johnson call, Macron’s office said the prime minister offered to “re-establish cooperation” and that the French president was “awaiting his proposals”. 
Macron was more emollient after phone talks on Wednesday with US President Joe Biden. 
According to a joint statement, Macron and Biden vowed to meet in Europe at the end of October, prior to both visiting Scotland for a UN climate summit hosted by Johnson. 
Downing Street said Johnson “looked forward to welcoming President Macron to Glasgow in November for COP26”, with both agreeing on the need for stronger climate action. 
Speaking at a meeting of the “E12” European security group, which includes Britain, French Defence Minister Florence Parly said news of the AUKUS alliance had come as a “shock”. 
“We expect clarification from not only an EI2 member but also an ally and a European country,” she told reporters at the talks in Stockholm. 
French anger over the submarine contract saw Macron recall the French ambassadors to Washington and Canberra in an unprecedented diplomatic protest. 
But the French envoy in London remained at her post, with France’s Europe Minister Clement Beaune dismissing London as a mere “third wheel” in the deal. 
Using Franglais, Johnson this week appealed to France to “donnez-moi un break” while also telling Paris to “prenez un grip (get a grip)”. 
The submarine spat has sunk relations between Paris and London to their lowest ebb since Britain’s 2016 vote to leave the European Union. 
Brexit has led to several disagreements between both nations, notably over fishing rights but also the issue of trade between mainland Britain and Northern Ireland, which came to a head during the G7 leaders’ meeting in June.",Newspaper
"Palestinian shot dead by Israeli troops in clashes; eight others injured
","September 25, 2021","RAMALLAH: A Palestinian was shot dead by Israeli troops on Friday when clashes broke out on the sidelines of a demonstration in the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian health ministry said. 
The victim was hit in the head by live fire, the ministry said, in the flashpoint town of Beita, scene of regular demonstrations against Israeli settlement expansion, which often degenerate into clashes. 
A family member identified the dead man as Mohammed Ali Khabisa, 27. 
He was taken to hospital in the northern West Bank city of Nablus where he died shortly afterwards, the ministry said. 
Another eight Palestinians were wounded by rubber-coated bullets, the Palestinians’ official 
 news agency reported. 
The Israeli military said it launched an investigation into “reports that a Palestinian was killed”. 
A statement claimed a “violent riot” had erupted during which “hundreds of Palestinians burned tyres and hurled rocks at IDF (Israeli Defense Forces) troops”. 
Beita residents have been demonstrating since May against the wildcat Jewish settlement outpost of Eviatar set up nearby without Israeli permission. 
The outpost was evacuated in early July but Israeli army troops remain stationed there while authorities deliberate on its fate. 
If the settlement is approved, its founders will be allowed to take up residence more permanently. 
Beita’s residents have vowed to continue their campaign until the army too leaves the outpost. 
Several protesters have been killed and hundreds wounded in clashes with the Israeli security forces since May. 
Israel occupied the West Bank in the Six-Day War of 1967 and all Jewish settlements in the territory are considered illegal by most of the international community. 
Almost half a million people live in Israeli settlements in the West Bank, alongside 2.8m Palestinians.",Newspaper
"Asad Umar says Sindh govt never shared Green Line flaws
","September 25, 2021","KARACHI: As several parts of the metropolis remained submerged by rainwater on Friday after Thursday’s light-to-moderate rains, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government made it clear that it was primarily the responsibility of the provincial authorities to fix flaws, if any, in the infrastructure of the Green Line Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project that could have damaged the Central district’s drainage and sewerage system. 
The reaction came from a key member of Prime Minister Imran Khan’s cabinet, who claimed that the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) government in Sindh was only raising a hue and cry over the media as it had never formally approached the authorities in Islamabad regarding any flaws in the Green Line project infrastructure. 
He went on to offer the role of the federal government to fix the problem once and for all if the Sindh authorities could not handle the situation and found it hard to find any solution. 
“When we came to power [in August 2018] and took charge of the Green Line project, the ground infrastructure was very much built as the project was already launched [in Feb 2016],” Federal Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Asad Umar told 
. 
Mr Umar was responding to a question about the allegations of the Sindh government, which after Thursday’s rain and urban flooding, mainly in the Central district, had warned that the situation was unlikely to improve because of huge, concrete and kilometres-long infrastructure of the Green Line bus service that reportedly had led to almost collapse of the Central district’s drainage and sewerage system. 
“We continued with the project and the project has now been completed. We have never received any complaint from the Sindh government about any drainage or sewage problem they are facing. Now the sewage, drainage or whatever local problems, they are needed to be fixed by the provincial government. While taking care of Karachi Transformation Plan, I personally hold frequent meetings with Sindh officials, including the chief minister, but I was never told about any such shortcoming in the project. I only heard it last night [Thursday] over media.” 
On Thursday Karachi administrator and Sindh government spokesman Barrister Murtaza Wahab called the federal-funded Green Line project as the main source of flooding in the Central district. He even complained of receiving ‘no response’ from the federal government’s Sindh Infrastructure Development Company Ltd (SIDCL) despite bringing the complaint in its notice. 
“Last year we had witnessed the same hue and cry after rains and this year here it’s again,” said the administrator. “We have both — formally and informally — requested the SIDCL to fix this problem but they don’t pay any heed. The situation here [Nagan Chowrangi and Shehrshah Suri Road] would not improve if they [SIDCL] don’t fix it.” 
However, the PTI’s government doesn’t sound convinced and to strengthen his claim Mr Umar referred to other parts of the city where the Islamabad-funded projects had helped drain the rainwater out and saved them from urban flooding. 
“It’s not alone the Central district which faced the same situation, as there were other parts of the city as well where rainwater always caused damages,” he said. 
“But this year a visible difference was seen due to cleanliness of three major nullahs by the federal government — Mahmoodabad, Gujjar and Orangi Town,” he claimed.
The minister went on to say: “If the Sindh government is not capable of fixing the problem in the Central district, we would do this as well. But please say that you [Sindh government] cannot do it. The federal government will do it happily.”",Pakistan
"Mental capacity is of crucial value for conversion: LHC
","September 25, 2021","LAHORE: The Lahore High Court (LHC) has ruled that Muslim jurists regard mental capacity of a child as of crucial importance for conversion to Islam.  
“There is no exact definition of religion. It is a matter of faith…,” observed Justice Tariq Nadeem while dismissing a petition filed by a member of the Christian community seeking recovery of his daughter who married a Muslim man after embracing Islam.  
Gulzar Masih, a rickshaw driver from Faisalabad, had alleged that his minor daughter Chashman Kanwal was abducted by Mohammad Usman and his accomplices.  
He said the police found the girl but refused to hand over her custody to him saying she had converted to Islam and married Usman. Gulzar said he approached a local court in Faisalabad but it dismissed his application for the recovery of his daughter.  
In his detailed verdict on the petition on which a short order was issued last week, Justice Nadeem observes that the Supreme Court has held that Article 20 of the Constitution grants rights to citizens to propagate their faith but that right does not allow anyone to convert a person to another religion by coercion or inducement.  
Justice Nadeem maintains that forced conversion or imposing beliefs on others rather constitutes infringement of the right to freedom of religion.  
The judge says that neither Holy Quran nor any specific hadith of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) expressly stipulates minimum age for conversion to Islam.  
Justice Nadeem notes that Hazrat Ali (RA) was only ten when he accepted Islam.  
However, he says, Muslim jurists regard mental capacity of a child as of crucial importance when considering the question of his/her conversion.   
The judge remarks that the age of discernment is generally reckoned as the age when one attains puberty.  
Justice Nadeem holds that the high court cannot undertake a factual inquiry while exercising its jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution as the question whether a conversion is tainted or otherwise cannot be determined without recording evidence.  
The judge notes that the petitioner mentioned the age of his daughter as 17 years in the FIR and it divulged from the record that she had contracted marriage with the respondent and also recorded her statement before a judicial magistrate under Section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code.  
The judge states that the girl in her statement had said that she was sui juris and had embraced Islam on her own free will and without any coercion and no one had abducted her.  
“In the eventuality of above discussion, the instant writ petition has no merit and is hereby dismissed in limine,” the verdict concluded.",Newspaper

"Sharifs bought UK flats with motorway money, alleges Fawad
","September 27, 2021","ISLAMABAD: Minister for Information and Broadcasting Chaudhry Fawad Hussain on Sunday said the Sharif family had purchased Avenfield flats in London after committing massive corruption in the Lahore-Islamabad Motorway project.
The Sharif family was purchasing the Avenfield flats at the same time when the most expensive agreement of the region for the construction of a motorway was being signed by the then Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) government, he told a news conference.
Minister for Communications and Postal Services Murad Saeed also spoke.
Mr Fawad said the PML-N government did not spend the money on the welfare of people and rather it laundered the money abroad to buy luxury flats in London.
The minister said that the money spent on such expensive projects by the PML-N government was borrowed from different international financial institutions. As a result, he said, the country had to pay $2 billion in interest to a company which was in agreement with the then government to construct the motorway.
He mentioned a report published in a leading national daily on Dec 4, 2002, stating that the cost of Lahore-Islamabad Motorway had exceeded Rs60 billion. The total income from Motorway till 2002 was Rs450 million only, he added.
Lashing out at Prime Minister Imran Khan’s critics who said that he was against the construction of motorways in the past, Mr Fawad said Mr Khan was never against the development of road infrastructure, but the corruption which was committed in the name of such mega projects.
“There is no concept of development without road infrastructure because communication (linkages) are everything, but if you start building roads to promote your own business as it was in the case of Sharif family then there would be no development in the country,” he said. Mr Fawad said corrupt practices at local level did not cause major damage to the country, rather it was the systematic corruption of a prime minister and his cabinet members which ruined the nation.
The minister said that the same happened in the country where from 1947 to 2008, the total debt stood at Rs6 trillion, but it were the Sharif and Zardari families which took the debt to Rs27 trillion only in 10 years.
The incumbent government had to pay back $10 billion over the last three years because of loans taken by the past governments, he added.
The minister said the country still had to repay massive debt which had piled up due to corruption of those two families in all economic sectors of the country.
In reply to a question, the minister said that contracts worth Rs1 trillion for road projects had been signed during different tenures of the PML-N government.
The present government, he said, was striving hard to root out such mafias that had been weakening the country.
About corruption cases against the Sharif family, he said the government was pursuing them vigorously to take them to logical conclusion.
Speaking on the occasion, Murad Saeed said the construction and expansion of highways would not only usher in a new era of economic development in remote areas of Balochistan, but they would also pave the way for economic development in the entire region through CPEC.
He said that progress and prosperity of Balochistan province was must for the development of Pakistan, adding that “if Balochistan is prosperous then Pakistan will be prosperous”.
Mr Murad said that Prime Minister Khan not only promised development and prosperity of backward areas of Balochistan, but also took practical steps for the purpose.
The minister said that in comparison to rulers of the past, Mr Khan paid special attention to development of Balochistan .
He said the previous government claimed to have built roads in the past but they ignored Balochistan.
“We have always strived hard to put Balochistan on a path to progress to make it a developed province where people have equal access to health, education, clean drinking water, employment and business facilities,” Mr Murad asserted.
He said the previous governments in Balochistan only issued tenders for development projects but they practically did nothing for the purpose.
“The PTI government not only approved the western route of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) but also initiated Zhob-Kuchlak project,” he said.
The minister said that construction work on 146-km-long Hushab-Awaran Highway was in full swing.
He said Prime Minister Khan laid the foundation-stone of Quetta western byp­ass and Dera Murad Jamali bypass this year.
The video of Quetta western bypass project has been released and work on Dera Murad Jamali Bypass was under way, he said.",Pakistan

Usyk, giving away height, weight and reach to the champion, proved too elusive for Joshua throughout an enthralling contest and landed the much cleaner shots, finishing with a flurry in round 12 as he went in search of a knockout. 
Joshua stayed on his feet but the decision was a formality as Usyk claimed the WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO belts. The three judges scored the fight 117-112, 116-112, 115-113. 
Former Olympic champion Usyk, who was contesting only his third professional heavyweight fight, follows in the footsteps of compatriots Wladimir and Vitali Klitschko who dominated the division for a decade from 2004-15. 
He is also just the third cruiserweight world champion to step up a weight and become the heavyweight world champion after Evander Holyfield and David Haye. 
For Joshua, a second career defeat was a crushing blow and scuppered his hopes of a unification showdown with fellow Briton Tyson Fury, the WBC holder, who takes on American Deontay Wilder in Las Vegas on Oct 9. 
Even the most diehard Joshua fans had to admit that their man had been schooled by a silky opponent who rarely looked ruffled even when sustaining a cut above his eye late on. 
Joshua gave the crowd little to cheer about and appeared to run out of ideas against his southpaw opponent who was ahead throughout the fight. 
“This means a lot for me. The fight went the way I expected it to go. There were moments when Anthony pushed me hard but it was nothing special,” Usyk told Sky Sports. “I had no objective to knock him out because my corner pushed me not to do that. In the beginning, I tried to hit him hard but then I stuck to my job.” 
A sensational atmosphere greeted the fighters as they climbed into the ring, with the crowd in full cry and fireworks blasting into the sky. 
But from the moment the first bell sounded, Joshua appeared unsure whether to try to overpower his opponent or try to outbox him -- and he failed miserably at both. 
A nervous hush descended on the stadium in the opening rounds as Usyk’s threat became all too apparent. 
Constantly on the move, he rocked Joshua in the third with a powerful left hand. 
Usyk retained control in the following rounds as Joshua failed to unleash his supposed superior power and the Londoner was in big trouble again in the seventh round as he was sent staggering backwards by a big left hook. 
A nick appeared above Usyk’s eye in the 10th round but Joshua’s face was showing signs of battle damage. 
Joshua needed a knockout to retain his belts but it was Usyk who came closest with a ferocious attack at the end of the 12th. 
Even before the official result was announced, some Joshua fans were heading for the exits while Usyk’s followers were just getting the party started.",Newspaper

"Teenage girl ‘gang raped’ in Haripur
","September 27, 2021","HARIPUR: Three persons, including a van driver, gang raped a teenage girl in Baldhair area here, the police said on Sunday.

"LDA to probe failure to get jurisdiction ordinance promulgated
","September 27, 2021","LAHORE: The governing body of the Lahore Development Authority (LDA) has asked the director-general (DG) to inquire into the issue related to the failure of the officers in getting extended the LDA (amendment) ordinance of 2021 (XVIII) promulgated on April 13, amending the LDA act, 1975 (XXX of 1975) under which the jurisdiction of the authority was reverted to the Lahore metropolitan area as defined under section 9 (1) (b) of the Punjab Local Government Act of 2019.
The body took the decision in a meeting on Sept 22 after the matter related to LDA’s jurisdiction regarding the master planning of the entire Lahore division or the metropolitan areas alone came under discussion, 
 has learnt.
LDA DG Ahmad Aziz Tarar, however, said the issue would be resolved soon as the ordinance has been extended. “This has been extended by a resolution of the Punjab Assembly. However, the last date of extension is not available to me at the moment,” he added.
According to an official source, the 2021 (amendment) ordinance amending the LDA Act, 1975, promulgated by the governor on April 13, was not enacted on its expiry date. “Later, we heard that it was extended in August and itexpire on Oct 1,” the official source in LDA told 
 on Sunday.
“And if this is not enacted or extended on October 1, the jurisdiction of the LDA to Lahore division (Lahore Metropolitan areas and the districts of Kasur, Sheikhupura and Nankana Sahib) would ultimately be considered as restored.”
According to the minutes of the meeting held to discuss the compliance with the decisions taken by the LDA governing body in its 6th meeting of the year held on Aug 17, the participants discussed the issues pertaining to the master planning of the Lahore division.
“It was discussed that the functions of the LDA (under the ordinance) have been restricted to the Lahore metropolitan areas. It was decided in the meeting that the opinion of the stakeholders of three districts (Kasur, Sheikhupura, and Nankana) as well as the legal aspects regarding the master plan by the LDA for areas outside its jurisdiction need to be considered”, read the minutes.
The authority constituted a committee consisting of the secretaries of housing, local government and law departments, and the LDA DG to look into the matter and submit its recommendations as soon as possible. The committee in its meetings deliberated and observed that in view of article 128 of the constitution, the matter would be reconsidered after enactment of the ordinance on this issue. However, the committee recommended that till such time the enactment is made, the LDA will restrict itself the master of Lahore.“
It may be recalled that following promulgation of the ordinance, the local government department, through a letter titled ‘Curtailment of Jurisdiction of LDA with respect to land use and housing schemes viz-a-viz Nankana Sahib, Sheikhupura and Kasur’ directed the LDA to hand it over the entire land use and private housing schemes record related to the districts of Sheikhupura, Nankana Sahib and Kasur to the respective defunct tehsil municipal administrations/municipal committees/tehsil councils with immediate effect. Following the ordinance and the direction, the LDA started handing over the entire land use/private housing schemes/subdivisions record to the respective defunct local government field formations based in these districts.
The LDA’s jurisdiction, in view of the rising complaints related to the mushroom growth of illegal housing schemes, commercial buildings and inappropriate land use in Kasur, Nankana and Sheikhupura, was expanded in 2013 to the entire Lahore division with an objective to regulate all such affairs under uniformed laws, rules/regulations and policies instead of getting these done by the then TMAs. However, the problems related to various issues in these districts couldn’t be resolved due to various legal, technical and administrative problems.
Though the then PML-N government was satisfied with its decision, the PTI government, started working to reverse most of the PML-N orders/policies, including the LDA (Amendment Act) 2013, under which the authority’s jurisdiction was expanded to other districts. Finally, Governor Chaudhry Sarwar on April 13 issued an ordinance to amend the LDA Act, 1975, deleting Sheikhupura, Kasur and Nankana Sahib from the LDA’s scope of work.
 The LDA administration, following the decisions of the governing body in its meeting, has introduced amendments to the building and zoning regulations-2019. Under amendments (Ramps & Toilets for Persons with Disabilities), all buildings other than the residential ones would have such facilities accessible by wheelchair-bound people and those with other disabilities.",Pakistan
"Use of mobile phones while driving to be included in list of serious offences
","September 27, 2021","ISLAMABAD: After much deliberation in the ministries of law and interior, the traffic police have now decided to include the use of mobile phones while driving in the list of serious offences.
It has proposed to fine motorcyclists Rs1,000, car drivers Rs1,500 and public transport drivers Rs2,000 for using mobile phones to text, voice calls and making videos while driving.
“We are waiting for the Cabinet Division to approve the new proposed fines. At present, use of mobile phones comes under the heading of ‘other miscellaneous offences’,” said SP Islamabad Traffic Police (ITP) Sarfraz Virk.
According to ITP’s data, since January, 53 accidents have been registered of vehicles hitting bikes of which 43 were fatal. There have been 21 accidents of vehicles hitting pedestrians of which 15 were fatal and 30 collisions between vehicles of which 11 were fatal. The numbers of unregistered cases are not known.
The ITP also does not know if the cause of the above-mentioned accidents was distracted driving, including the 40,527 fines for lane violations.
Since the start of 2021, 15,233 drivers have been fined a meagre Rs300 for using mobile phones while driving. Still there is no specific ban on talking and texting while driving.
SP Virk complained that traffic police were facing an acute shortage of staff and had sought additional human and material resources.
“Today, the human resource and material are the same as it were in 2005 when the ITP was set up for the estimated 500,000 indigenous population of the capital city,” he said.
“The indigenous population has increased to 2.2 million while traffic police are working with the same strength of 685 staff which included officers and jawans. Among the top functions we perform are VVIP movement, pilot duties for dignitaries, traffic regulation, licencing, education and finally enforcements,” SP Virk said.
He further said the number of traffic police staff had dropped to 618 after some of them retired and the positions were still vacant.
“With 10 per cent (62) personnel on leave, the traffic police are currently equipped with 556 staff working in three shifts. During a VVIP movement, 350 staff are engaged on the 17 km stretch from the airport to Serena Hotel,” the SP said, giving an example of why enforcement was suffering.
“We have proposed to increase the staff to 2,600-plus to increase presence across the city, including two new zones. Of these, over 1,200 wardens will be dedicated for the enforcement of regulations on roads,” he said.
According to Mr Virk, these increased resources are needed especially after the number of cars registered in the capital city till April 2021 had increased to 1.17 million since 1981. From 1981 till 2005, there were roughly 250,000 vehicles registered in the city.
“Our biggest challenge is that citizens in supposedly 100pc literate Islamabad break the law knowing it can have serious consequences. Accidents happen in a blink of an eye. You have to be paying attention all the time. You never know what call, which text, or your post can be your last when you are doing it from behind the wheel,” said another senior police official.
He said there was never a text or a social media post that needed a response while behind the wheel. When these tragedies happen, it’s not the people who were involved but their families also whose lives were changed.
A citizen, Shehryar Khan, said: “There is less talking on cell phones when people are behind wheels, but a lot more fiddling with them.”
Often there was one driver ahead slowing up traffic behind him only because he must respond to a “very” important text message or just for no reason keep checking WhatsApp or Facebook, complained Babar Shah, adding: “The police check speeding, why doesn’t it fine drivers for under-speeding and disrupting smooth flow of traffic,” he added.
Iqbal Siddiqui was waiting for the light to turn green at a signal when a speeding Toyota Passo squeezed between his Honda Civic and the road divider, scraping the paint job and hitting and twisting the side mirror before coming to a screeching stop past the zebra crossing. While there were minor scratches on the right side of the Civic, the two drivers in front were not so lucky.
“There was hardly any space between the two cars in front and the divider. The newlywed couple in the Passo were distracted by their phones. Luckily, no one was hurt,” he said.",Pakistan
"Pakistani startup Oraan raises $3m seed funding for gender-inclusive fintech
","September 27, 2021","Oraan, a Karachi-based gender-inclusive fintech, has raised $3 million in the largest seed funding closed by a local women-led startup, according to a press statement issued by the company. 
The statement said the investment was co-led by Zayn Capital and Wavemaker Partners, with participation from Resolution Ventures, i2i Ventures, Hustle Fund, Haitou Global, Plug and Play, and angels like Claire Diaz-Ortiz, a former partner at Magma Partners, who has also come on board as an adviser to the company. 
Previously, the fintech had raised financing from Tharros, Zayn Capital, an angel syndicate led by Google executives, and Graph Ventures, bringing its total funding raised to date to just over $4m. 
Oraan was founded in 2018 by Halima Iqbal, a former investment banker, and Farwah Tapal, a design strategist.
“Oraan was founded when we realised that the large majority of the Pakistani population struggles to access financial services simply because they are not designed for them,” said Iqbal. “While there is a demand among women for credit, insurance and savings services, they are unable to approach financial institutions due to mistrust, complexity of products and challenges around mobility.”
According to the press statement, the startup has designed products and services around credit, insurance, and savings in Pakistan, which it says is home to five per cent of the world’s unbanked female population. 
The statement described Oraan Committees, the startup’s flagship product, as the digital reimagination of Rotating Saving and Credit Associations (ROSCAs) — an age-old method of group saving and credit. 
""ROSCAs, usually known as committees or beesees in Pakistan, are used by 41 per cent of the Pakistani population, with up to $5 billion rotating annually,"" it said, explaining that using the Oraan app, users could sign up for committees that suited their needs and allowed them to save with groups beyond their immediate geographical and social networks.
Recently, Oraan was selected for the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Regulatory Sandbox programme, the press statement said, adding that today, Oraan boasted a community of over 10,000 savers, 84pc of whom were women, from across 170-plus cities. 
""These women use Oraan Committees to save, borrow, build emergency funds, and achieve other goals like travel and pay for education, working capital, as well as medical treatments."" 
The statement added that the startup now planned to use its knowledge to launch other financial products especially catering to women ""in the hopes of becoming the country’s women-first digital, social bank"". 
Speaking about Oraan, Faisal Chowdry of Zayn Capital said: ""Having been involved with Oraan since early 2020, we are excited to co-lead Oraan's latest funding round to help promulgate indigenous finance across Pakistan and in the region. Our belief is that the digitisation of indigenous finance solutions and behaviours is the key to unlocking the fintech opportunity in Pakistan and providing real utility in terms of product for customers."" 
He added that ""being able to be a part of the story of the only women-led and founded fintech in Pakistan, with a goal of empowering women who sit at the financial helm of every household, fits with our ethos at Zayn. “ 
Similarly, Gavin Lee, general partner at Wavemaker Partners in Southeast Asia, said, ""With half of Pakistan's 200+ million population being female, it is striking that bank account penetration for women in the country stands at just seven per cent, making the gender gap in banking access in Pakistan one of the most serious in the world."" 
""We believe that designing a female-friendly financial product to help women access the banking system, and in turn allow them to access credit, insurance, and investment, is one of the most critical ways to promote sustainable economic growth in Pakistan,"" he added.
Commenting on Oraan raising $3 million, former special assistant to the prime minister on digital Pakistan Tania Airdus termed the development a ""big milestone"" for women in tech, entrepreneurship and ""millions that have been financially excluded"".
			 
Meanwhile, Federal Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Minister Asad Umar tweeted that ""Initiatives like Oraan which improve financial inclusiveness for women would make a great impact on key strategic objectives like women empowerment and increasing savings rate.""

"PML-N's Mohammad Zubair denounces 'fake and doctored' video
","September 27, 2021","PML-N leader Mohammad Zubair denounced on Monday what he termed a ""new low"" in politics after an alleged video of him and an unidentified women went viral on social media.

"CTD detains two suspected militants linked with IS in Karachi
","September 27, 2021","The Counter-Terrorism Department and a federal intelligence agency carried out a joint raid at New Truck Stand on Karachi's Mauripur Road on Monday and detained two suspected militants linked with the Islamic State (IS) group, according to CTD official Mazhar Mashwani.
The official said the detained men had been identified as Naseemullah alias Naseem and Mohammed Isa alias Molvi Idris. 
The CTD has claimed to have seized two pistols along with rounds from the custody of the held suspects.
According to Mashwani, the suspects were trained in Shorawak and Baramcha areas of Afghanistan and have expertise in the use of explosive material. 
During interrogation, it was revealed that Naseemullah had married the daughters of two killed IS militants, namely Hafeez Pandrani and Mohammed Siddiq, Mashwani said, adding that both his wives were involved in the transport of weapons and explosive material to militants.
The officer added that Naseemullah had provided an explosive-laden Datsun vehicle to an IS militant, Abdullah Brohi, in Khuzdar in 2013. 
The CTD had registered cases against both the detained men and they were being further interrogated, while relevant police stations had been approached for more information, the official said.
Monday's arrests follow the 
 of 11 suspected IS militants by the CTD in Balochistan's Mastung area last month.
A CTD spokesperson had said at the time that a search operation had been conducted in Mastung on the basis of an intelligence report about the presence of suspected terrorists in a compound.
The security personnel had cordoned off the compound and asked the armed men to surrender, but they opened fire instead.
“After the heavy gun battle that ensued, 11 alleged terrorists were found dead in the compound, which they were using as their hideout,” the spokesperson had said.
He had added that a huge quantity of arms and ammunition was seized from the compound.",Pakistan

Sherman will meet senior officials in Islamabad on October 7-8 after an earlier visit to New Delhi and Mumbai on October 6-7, when she will meet officials and civil society leaders and address the US-India Business Council's annual “ideas summit”, the State Department said.
Prime Minister Imran Khan, in an

“In Afghanistan, the lack of legitimacy for an outsider's protracted war was compounded by a corrupt and inept Afghan government, seen as a puppet regime without credibility, especially by rural Afghans,” he wrote, elaborating on themes in his address on Friday to the UN General Assembly.
He urged the world to engage the Taliban government “to ensure peace and stability”.
Biden, who like his predecessors has called for strong relations with India, has yet to speak to Prime Minister Imran, although Secretary of State Antony Blinken

"Irsa fails to finalise water distribution formula as Rabi season starts
","October 1, 2021","ISLAMABAD: With over 28 per cent shortage anticipated, the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) could not finalise on Thursday water distribution mechanism for Rabi season, starting on Oct 1, amid serious differences among the provinces.
It was a rare meeting of the Irsa’s advisory committee that was marred by protests, walkouts and inconclusive sessions that could not reach agreement on any of the agenda items. The only agreement among the Irsa members and provincial secretaries for agriculture and irrigation was to meet again on Oct 5 with the same agenda items.
The meeting presided over by Saif Anjum, who is officiating as Irsa member for Punjab and chairman, came under criticism when Irsa’s member for Sindh objected to the proposal for distribution of water shares among the provinces under the three-tier formula based on the combination of para 2, para 4 and para 14(b) of the 1991 Water Appor-tionment Accord to allocate shares in times of shortages.
Under para 2, provincial water shares are fixed on the basis of about 38 million acre feet (MAF) of water availability in Rabi at the rate of about 19MAF to Punjab, about 15MAF to Sindh, about 3.5MAF to KP and 1.3MAF to Balochistan, while para 2 required balance river supplies like floods at the rate of 37pc each to Punjab and Sindh, 12pc for Balochistan and 14pc for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). Under para 14(b) of the accord, the record of actual average system uses for the period 1977-82, would form the guidelines for developing a future regulation pattern. These ten daily uses would be adjusted pro-prata to correspond to the indicated seasonal allocations of the different canal systems and would form the basis for sharing shortages and surpluses on all-Pakistan basis.
The remaining provincial members and chairman reminded the Sindh representatives that the three-tier formula was finalised by Irsa in 2003 with consensus of all the provinces and all three above sections were part of the accord and not from outside.
It was also explained that Sindh had already moved a reference to the Council of Common Interests (CCI) on the subject and should wait for the outcome.
Sindh’s team insisted that water distribution for Rabi should be done under para 2, i.e. 37pc of available water each to Punjab and Sindh and 12 and 14pc to Balochistan and KP, respectively. Sindh also demanded that water shortage should be applicable to Balochistan and KP and they should not be exempt from cuts.
The majority view was that distribution could not be made under para 2 because the water available was less than the required quantity. Irsa’s Balochistan and KP members said that Sindh’s demand for cut in their water shares was unreasonable.
The Irsa member for Balochistan also made a formal complaint that Sindh had denied 0.8MAF from its water share approved by Irsa in just-concluded Kharif season which should be compensated through higher share in Rabi.
Sindh’s Irsa member, secretary for irrigation and secretary for agriculture staged a walkout on the grounds that they could not remain part of the meeting when their stance was not accepted.",Pakistan
"IBA says expelled student can appeal against committee’s decision
","October 1, 2021","KARACHI: A day after its disciplinary committee 
, the Institute of Business Administration (IBA) made clear on Thursday that the student had the right to appeal to numerous committees if he did not insist on terms against the IBA’s rules and processes.
The student, Mohammad Gibrail, had reported on social media an 
 that took place on the campus on August 25. He had posted on his Facebook details of the incident wherein he saw an employee of IBA’s finance department allegedly shouting at and threatening a female employee.
The student later refused IBA’s directive to take down the post. The concerned female employee also filed a complaint in writing with IBA’s anti-harassment committee, which is yet to announce details of its investigation.
The case led to students’ protests and caused uproar on the social media on IBA’s decision, which many described as “gross over-reaction” and “extremely unfair”.
On Thursday, IBA Executive Director S Akbar Zaidi sent a note to his colleagues stating that he knew many of them were upset at the decision of the disciplinary committee. “Such decisions are not easy. The student was given numerous opportunities to discuss issues and find a way which did not lead to the decision taken. Many of our colleagues intervened and pleaded with him to try and find a way out, but he wanted [the employee in question] to be dismissed first without recourse to IBA’s process.”
He stated that an IBA’s official was asked to leave the IBA “on charges which are similar to those being alleged. It took various committees and the Board of Governors seven months to terminate his services, but this happened through various processes, exactly what we are doing now and what has happened over the last few weeks”.
Dr Zaidi said the student “has the right to appeal to numerous committees if he so wishes, as long as he does not insist on terms which are against IBA’s rules and processes”.
While the IBA did not name the expelled student, Gibrail posted on Facebook on Sept 28 that he sensed that the IBA’s disciplinary committee was going to expel him. “Even still, I’m saying with all my complete senses that I WILL NOT SAY SORRY EVEN IF IT WILL COST MY HEAD. I cannot be a hypocrite, a person who has difference in his words and deeds, and a person who takes decision by looking towards the number of people supporting him; I cannot be that person.”
Earlier on Wednesday, the institute released a statement on the student’s expulsion according to which the BS Economics programme student was “counselled” by various members of the IBA community. “However, despite the counselling provided to him, the student refused to adhere to the right channels that are expected to be followed by all members of the IBA faculty, students, and staff,” it said.
The disciplinary committee found him guilty of sharing details of the alleged harassment incident on social media “without first following the SOPs that are expected to be followed at IBA”.
“Sharing details about an alleged incident without having complete knowledge of the context/ background on any public platform is against IBA’s rules and regulations,” the statement said.
The student was also found to have “shared details of the employee (Facebook profile including picture of the person) of the institute even before the victim filed an official complaint, which led to endangering the physical and psychological safety of the employee, his co-workers, and the department”.
The student “defamed the institute, its finance department, and the employee [besides] senior professors on various national forums” as well as “incited students to protest and led demonstrations against the institute and pit the students and the IBA administration against one another which could have jeopardised the security of the protesters and the administration personnel”, the statement added.
The IBA disciplinary committee accused the student of having endangered the physical and psychological safety of other students, employees, and faculty members through the protests.
He also “(attempted) to influence the decisions of the relevant committees, which are completely independent and neutral, to achieve desired outcomes through dissemination of the incident and chain of events on mediums of communications outside the IBA and spreading misinformation and twisting of facts”, the statement said.
It further read: “It is important to note that his highlighting the incident of alleged harassment within IBA has been appreciated by the IBA administration. We welcome our students pointing out issues which are of concern to them and our community. This is something that we, at the IBA, take very seriously and we have senior professors, management, and experts of the field, including many women, who are part of the committee to investigate such matters as per IBA/HEC policy of anti-harassment through the Anti-Harassment Committee.”
“However, we need to emphasize that the act of the student of whistle-blowing of alleged harassment has nothing to do with the disciplinary matter, which was the basis of the hearing and recommendation. The IBA Anti-Harassment Committee is investigating the case as per IBA and HEC rules, regulations, and procedures. We do not jump to any conclusions on the basis of hearsay and always follow processes before any decision can be taken,” it added.",Pakistan
"Dengue cases’ spike a wake-up call for Punjab govt
","October 1, 2021","LAHORE: Spike in dengue cases in the provincial capital has set alarm bells ringing.
The data shows that 223 people contracted dengue virus in Punjab during the last 24 hours (Thursday) including 167 in Lahore.
A day earlier, the number of the positive cases was 136 in Punjab -- 103 of them in the provincial capital.
Other than the official figures, there are reports that the health authorities have failed to show the actual disease burden which is higher than what is being reported daily. Health practitioners in private and public-sector hospitals claim that dengue has hit Lahore hard and most cases go unreported.
The official data shows the dengue cases are on the rise also in Rawalpindi which reported 35 cases of the virus during the last 24 hours (Thursday) which a day earlier were 17, showing a 100 per cent surge.
In Punjab the total number of the positive cases of the virus has reached 1,659 and 1,347 have been reported in Lahore alone.
A health official said the Punjab government seemed non-serious to stop fast transmission of dengue because of the tardy work to destroy the breeding grounds of mosquitoes spreading virus. He said that owing to recent rains, water has accumulated alongside the roads and at green belts, government offices and private buildings. The teams formed for the purpose, he said, were visiting very few places to check breeding of larvae.
Thousands of health teams would go from door to door to check and destroy larvae during the previous government under the regulations formed at that time to get rid of the epidemic, he said. Former chief minister Shehbaz Sharif undertook unprecedented measures to combat the epidemic, said the official who had previously served in the Shehbaz Sharif-led government.
Recalling the steps the government had taken in this direction, he said officials drafted and issued special standard operating procedures (SOPs) for dengue control -- Prevention & Control of Dengue -- by appointing designated staff which was trained at home and abroad.
Mr Sharif presided over nearly 90 meetings being chief minister of Punjab and dengue cells comprising public health experts were formed besides constituting the teams of the police and district government officials to conduct raids to book those violating the dengue SOPs or guidelines. The official said hundreds of cases were lodged by the Punjab police daily.
Information technology programmes were run to collect data of reported cases of the dengue virus besides the reports to destroy larvae from across the province on a daily basis. The government also invited Sri Lankan experts to seek their help, said the official.",Pakistan
"Principal detains minor girl in Narowal for fee default
","October 1, 2021","NAROWAL: Muhammad Arshad was at his shop in Shakargarh on Sept 27 when he received a frantic call from the rickshaw driver who provides pick-and-drop service to his three daughters, the students of a private school in the locality.
The worried driver told him the school principal had held hostage one of his daughters in a locked room. Arshad immediately rushed to the school and found that the principal had locked his daughter, Fatima, a class one student, in a classroom. The screams of the terrified minor girl could be heard in the school.
When asked for the reason to detain her, Arshad, of Muhalla Madina Colony, says principal Muhammad Rizwan told him that the girl was being penalised for defaulting on the school paper funds worth Rs5,000. He was told to arrange the money to secure the release of his daughter.
Arshad says his three daughters are enrolled in the Dream Public School. On that fateful day, the principal let Reham, 6, and Inaya, 8, go but detained Fatima, 7.
He says the principal showed resistance to let Fatima leave the school without the fee payment. The parents of other students, Omar Sharif and Khalid Khan, who were present at the school, reacted strongly to the incident, saying the school administration had created panic among the children by committing a shameful act.
On the complaint of Arshad, the city police have registered an FIR against principal Rizwan under section 342 of the Pakistan Penal Code.
Shakargarh DSP Malik Mohammad Khalil said the police registered the FIR against the principal after a preliminary investigation. He said strict action would be taken against the suspect as per law.
The principal is at large.
Deputy Commissioner Nabila Irfan said a report of the incident had been sought from the chief executive officer of the education authority.

"Economic Coordination Committee okays wheat, urea import tenders
","October 1, 2021","ISLAMABAD: The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet on Thursday asked the Power Division to seek a review from power regulator for a streak of quarterly tariff adjustments for K-Electric involving Rs101 billion burden on budget and approved tenders for import of 550,000 tonnes of wheat and 100,000 tonnes of urea.
The meeting presided over by Finance and Revenue Minister Shaukat Tarin also extended for a month the Prime Minister’s Relief Package-2020 for provision of five essential items on subsidised rates that expired on Sept 30. “The ECC granted extension for one-month with a direction to present a detailed summary before ECC, keeping in view, international price hike in essential food commodities,” a statement said.
The ECC also approved a summary of the Ministry of National Food Security for award of fifth international wheat tender to import 550,000 tonnes (after matching process) of wheat for the FY22. It also approved a tender for import of 100,000 tonnes of urea for building strategic reserves of the fertiliser during the Rabi season FY22.
On a summary moved by the Power Division regarding quarterly tariff adjustments of K-Electric, the ECC decided that the Power Division may approach National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) to review its earlier decision on the issue and present an updated summary before ECC for consideration. The Power Division had proposed to adjust pending tariff claims of KE worth Rs101bn against its payables towards Power Division’s Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA).
One tariff determined by Nepra was duly notified by the federal government on May 22, 2019. Also, quarterly tariff adjustments determined by Nepra on Dec 31, 2019 of 11 quarters, on the basis of last quarter April-June 2019, tariff was notified on Oct 12, 2020 to maintain uniform tariff. It was reported that in the matter of Discos the difference between actual cost of supplying power and reference rates was passed on to consumers prospectively through fuel cost adjustment (FCA) and QTAs (quarterly tariff adjustments) mechanism.
However, in case of KE the reference rates (fuel and capacity) are rebased on quarterly basis through mechanisms for adjustments as provided in 2018 multi-year tariff and accordingly the difference in actual and reference rates relates for previous period cannot be charged to consumers prospectively and hence to be paid through GoP subsidy.
Power Division tabled another summary regarding levy of sales tax on subsidy granted by federal government to Discos. After seeking input from all concerned, the ECC decided that the matter may be referred to the Law Division for seeking opinion and legal interpretation may be presented before the committee for further deliberations.
The issue pertained to sales tax claimed by FBR on subsidy paid by the government to the consumers on socioecoomic considerations and such claims had gone beyond Rs100bn. The power companies claimed that GST on subsidy for recovery form consumers was illegal because the subsidy was provided by the government and federal government could not be taxed. Also, a socioeconomic obligation could be taxes and a resulted recovery of uncharged tax from Discos would result in increase in circular debt.
The ECC approved summary by the Power Division regarding approval of payment mechanism for TNB Liberty Power Ltd. The ECC approved the proposal as part of settlement with other relevant IPPs.",Newspaper
"Israeli fire kills three Palestinians in day of unrest
","October 1, 2021","JERUSALEM: Three Palestinians were killed on Thursday by Israeli fire, including a 
 in Jerusalem, a militant shot during West Bank clashes and a Gazan who approached the border fence.
The violence comes days after an Israeli raid on militants in the occupied West Bank left five Palestinians dead.
At dawn in Jerusalem, the sound of gunshots rang through the Old City, with the body of a woman lying on a stone street that leads to the Al Aqsa mosque, a journalist said. She was later draped in a survival blanket.
Police said she had attempted to stab officers after being stopped for a check because her conduct aroused suspicion.
“During the questioning, the terrorist pulled out a knife and tried to stab the officers. They immediately responded with gunfire and neutralised her,” a statement said, noting medics later pronounced her dead.
The woman was identified by Palestinian officials as Israa Khozaimieh, 30, from Qabatiya in the northern West Bank. The attempted attack did not result in any Israeli casualties. Israeli security forces are stationed at each entrance to the Al Aqsa mosque compound, Islam’s third holiest site, known to Jews as the Temple Mount, the holiest site in Judaism.
The compound lies in east Jerusalem, which Israel occupied in 1967 and later annexed in a move never recognised by the international community.
In a separate incident in Burqin, in the northern West Bank near Jenin, Israeli troops and border police conducted an overnight operation “to arrest suspects and locate weapons,” a police statement said.
“During the operation, an armed terrorist fired at the forces who were operating in the village during a riot,” police said.
“Border police forces responded with gunfire toward the terrorist and neutralised him,” police said.
Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad said the man killed was Alaa Zayoud, 22, a member of its military wing.
No Israeli forces were wounded in the incident in the West Bank, a Palestinian territory under Israeli military occupation since 1967.
On Sunday, five Palestinians were killed after an Israeli raid in the West Bank sparked gun battles with Hamas militants, two of them in Burqin, officials said.
One of those killed in Burqin on Sunday was an Islamic Jihad member, and the movement said on Thursday that Zayoud had “joined” him.
Hamas, the militant rulers of the Gaza Strip, issued a statement in support of the “martyrdom” of Zayoud, saying “armed resistance and comprehensive confrontation” with Israel were the way to expel “settlers” from “our occupied land”.
In a third and unrelated incident in Gaza, Israeli troops “spotted three suspects approaching the security fence,” an army statement said.",Newspaper
"Chris Gayle pulls out of Indian Premier League citing 'bubble fatigue'
","October 1, 2021","West Indies cricket star Chris Gayle has pulled out of the Indian Premier League (IPL) with “bubble fatigue” and will instead focus on this month's T20 World Cup.
The big-hitting 42-year-old batsman played two out of three matches for Punjab Kings since the big-bucks tournament resumed in the United Arab Emirates last month.
Gayle left the team hotel because of “bubble fatigue” accumulated over the months playing franchise and international cricket during the coronavirus pandemic, Kings said in a statement.
Gayle said he wished to “mentally recharge and refresh myself”.
“I want to refocus on helping the West Indies in the T20 World Cup and would like to take a break in Dubai,” he was quoted as saying in the statement.
On Wednesday, Gayle released the music video of his new single “Punjabi Daddy” with the self-styled “Universe Boss” sporting traditional Indian dress and shaking a leg to the catchy tune.
			
Players in world cricket have often needed to restrict themselves to strict bio-bubbles because of the coronavirus.
They frequently have to stay within the confines of their team hotel and often cannot mingle with anyone outside, even on non-match days.
Some players have opted out, including Kieron Pollard, Andre Russell and David Warner pulling out of The Hundred tournament earlier this year.
The IPL has also been hit by withdrawals, with Josh Hazlewood and Liam Livingstone staying away over similar reasons.
Kings head coach Anil Kumble said the team respected Gayle's decision and “desire to prepare himself for the T20 World Cup” starting on October 17 in the UAE and Oman.
Punjab, who were due to play Kolkata Knight Riders later on Friday, are sixth in the table in the eight-team IPL.

"Petrol prices in Pakistan still cheap compared to rest of the world, says finance minister day after price hike
","October 1, 2021","Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin on Friday said petrol prices in Pakistan were cheaper than the rest of the region and the world, adding that only 16 countries had lower prices — all of them being oil producers themselves. 
Addressing a press conference in Islamabad with Minister of State for Information Farrukh Habib, Tarin said: ""There are only 16 other countries which have lower petrol prices than ours. They are oil producers and have their own oil."" 
The finance minister added that Pakistan had cheaper petrol prices than other regional countries as well, such as India and Bangladesh. ""We are cheaper than the [rest of the] region and the world as well. Do we want to reduce it (petrol price) further? absolutely,"" Tarin said. 
He said the current issue was if the government reduced prices then it would have to pay out of its pocket to fulfil revenue requirements. Tarin added that the petroleum levy had also been reduced to Rs2 to Rs3 per litre from Rs30/litre in 2018. 
""We are not even charging [petroleum] levy even though we have kept a target of Rs600 billion for it in the budget. But we and the prime minister didn't care for it. 
""The prime minister said that we can't burden the people further so this is a signal [about] what feelings the current ruler has for the poor,"" the finance minister said. 
His comments came a day after the government 
 by Rs4 per litre. The price of petrol stands at Rs127.30 per litre from October 1 (today). 
In a press release, the Finance Division said the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority had worked out higher petroleum prices based on an increase in prices in the international market as well as exchange rate variations in the last two weeks.
However, Prime Minister Imran Khan had ""decided against the recommendation and passed on the minimum increase in prices to the consumers"", it stated.
The government absorbed the higher international pressure of prices through a reduction in the petroleum levy and the sales tax, according to the notification. ""Petroleum prices in Pakistan are the cheapest in the region,"" it had said.
During his press conference today, the finance minister also addressed the issue of inflation and the prices of other essentials, saying that prices were being impacted all over the world due to the Covid-19 pandemic. 
""This disruption from Covid has impacted us as well and international prices currently are at their highest level in the last 10 to 12 years. 
""We have been affected by that as well because we have become a food importer. We did not become a food importer in only three years but we are facing the consequences of inadequacies in the agricultural sector for the last 30 years,"" Tarin explained. 
He said the government was investing in agriculture to increase productivity and self-reliance so payments to foreigners could be diverted to local producers. Tarin also outlined measures to provide relief to the general public in the prices of food essentials such as wheat, sugar and ghee. 
Furthermore, he added, direct food subsidies would be provided from October to the lowest segment of society comprising around 12.5 million households. 
He also outlined measures for agricultural reforms such as curbing middlemen profits in the agricultural supply chains. 
Regarding the overall economic situation of the country, Tarin said it had started growing and its effects were being felt on revenue collection with the Federal Board of Revenue exceeding its targets. 
""When our economy grows by more than five per cent then it will have a trickle-down effect,"" the finance minister said, adding that growth was being witnessed in industry, agriculture and services sectors. 
Tarin also said the 'Kamyab Pakistan Programme' would be launched very soon and four to six million households would be directly helped, 
The finance minister said that distributing cash handouts through the Ehsaas programme was not a ""permanent solution"". 
""We will teach people how to catch fish and not just give them fish so they can stand on their own feet,"" he added.
Regarding negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the power sector, he said the government would present alternative formulae and propose that raising tariffs was not the solution. 
""I am hopeful we will have a constructive discussion with the IMF and we will come to a solution."" 
Meanwhile, the finance minister's attribution of price increases to the Covid-19 pandemic drew criticism from PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif. 
He said singling out Covid-19 for blame was not only bad leadership but showed a ""consistent pattern of putting blame on external factors to shirk responsibility"".
			
PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari too launched a blistering attack against the government and rejected the increase in prices of petroleum products. 
""People are burning in the fire of historic inflation [and a] further increase in petrol prices is tantamount to fanning the flames.
""Taxes on petroleum products are an important source of revenue for the PTI government after ruining the economy,"" he said. 
			 
Bilawal said the people longed for relief and any good news from the incumbent government. ""[Prime Minister] Imran Khan should take another U-turn in the wider national interest [and] turn [back] his policies [by] 180 degrees,"" he added. 
The PPP chairman demanded that the increase in petrol prices along with additional taxes and duties should be withdrawn.

","October 1, 2021","Several media outlets, including the

According to 
, since Sept 21, the unverified account — which claimed to belong to the newly appointed Kabul University VC Mohammad Ashraf Ghairat — has posted tweets that were quickly picked up by the Western media.
One such tweet reads: ""Folks! I give you my words as the chancellor of Kabul University: as long as a real Islamic environment is not provided for all, women will not be allowed to come to universities or work. Islam first.""
			
The tweet quickly garnered attention and was picked up by the

However, in a turn of events straight out of a movie, the user operating the Twitter account later admitted that he was not the VC of Kabul University. Instead, he is a 20-year-old student at the varsity who is ""broken and frustrated"", he tweeted from the same account.
In a 
, he explained how he saw no future with the Taliban in power in the war-torn country.
""I grew up in Kabul, I went to school and university, I had dreams of becoming an influential person in Afghan society and politics. But now look at what has happened with all my aspirations,"" he said.
Speaking to

“What is going on in Afghanistan right now is the real joke,” Mahmoud told

"Regular engagement with US beneficial for both countries: FO
","October 8, 2021","ISLAMABAD: The Foreign Office on Thursday emphasised the need for regular engagement with the United States as US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman reached here for talks on bilateral ties and Afghanistan situation.
Foreign Office spokesman Asim Iftikhar, at the weekly media briefing, said: “Close and regular engagement between Pakistan and the United States has always been mutually beneficial and effective for stability in South Asia.”
Ties between Pakistan and US got off to a rough start under President Joe Biden, who assumed presidency in January. The new US president has remained reluctant to personally engage Prime Minister Imran Khan.
The absence of a telephone call between Mr Biden and Mr Khan has come to symbolise the irritants in the ties that have been marred by mutual mistrust. However, Washington has kept the channel of communications with Pakistan open at officials’ level in view of the latter’s importance for its interests in Afghanistan.
According to AFP, Ms Sherman offered her condolences to the families affected by the earthquake that struck parts of Balochistan on Thursday morning, leaving at least 20 people dead.
Ms Sherman’s visit follows a trip by CIA Director William Burns to Pakistan last month.
“There is a desire on the part of Pakistan, and I believe on part of US as well, to make this relationship broad-based and forward looking, moving away from looking at it mostly from the perspective of Afghanistan,” Mr Iftikhar said.
The developments in Afghanistan since the completion of the withdrawal of troops have widened the gulf between the two countries.
Pakistan is being held responsible for America’s Afghanistan predicament in Washington. The legislation proposed by 22 Republican senators calling for sanctions against Taliban and their foreign backers was an indication of the sentiment in the US.
Mr Iftikhar said: “While the views being expressed by lawmakers and experts during these (congressional) hearings do not necessarily reflect the United States’ official position, they are a matter of concern, and are nonetheless inconsistent with the reality of the ongoing cooperation between Pakistan and the US on Afghanistan.”
The spokesman emphasised the need for a relationship that took into account the interests of both countries. He noted that the two countries had multiple shared interests.
He said that during Ms Sherman’s meetings in Islamabad the two sides would exchange views on all issues of mutual interest including bilateral relations and the regional situation.
The visiting US official will meet Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Army Chief Gen Qamar Bajwa. She is also expected to call on Prime Minister Imran Khan.",Newspaper
"Saudi Arabia-led consortium completes Newcastle takeover
","October 8, 2021","LONDON: English Premier League club Newcastle United was sold to Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund on Thursday after a protracted takeover and legal fight involving concerns about piracy and rights abuses in the kingdom. 
The 300-million-pound ($409 million) takeover by the Saudi Public Investment Fund initially collapsed last year over concerns about how much control the kingdoms leadership would have in the running of Newcastle. 
PIF has had to offer assurances to the Premier League that its chairman, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and in turn the state will not have any control of the running of Newcastle. 
A rapid sequence of events reignited the deal after Qatar-based broadcaster beIN Sports, a Premier League rights holder, said on Wednesday that Saudi Arabia would lift a ban on it and also shut down illegal streaming services, removing a major obstacle behind the collapsed takeover. 
“We are extremely proud to become the new owners of Newcastle United, one of the most famous clubs in English football,” PIF governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan said. “We thank the Newcastle fans for their tremendously loyal support over the years and we are excited to work together with them.”
The PIF will be the majority partner alongside wealthy British-based Reuben brothers and financier Amanda Staveley. 
The Premier League said the club has been sold to the consortium with immediate effect following the completion of its owners and directors test. 
“The legal disputes concerned which entities would own and/or have the ability to control the club following the takeover,” the Premier League said in statement. “All parties have agreed the settlement is necessary to end the long uncertainty for fans over the clubs ownership. The Premier League has now received legally binding assurances that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will not control Newcastle United Football Club.” 
The takeover ends the 14-year ownership by British retail tycoon Mike Ashley, who has been widely viewed as a figure of scorn in the one-club city, whose St James Park stadium is affectionately dubbed the cathedral on the hill. 
Hundreds of Newcastle’s so-called Toon Army supporters, who have protested against Ashley’s running of the club, gathered outside the stadium in the drizzle throughout the day, buoyed by news of the imminent takeover. 
While they were celebrating, others said it was another example of Saudi Arabia “sportswashing”.",Newspaper

“I hear people saying that general elections in the country are going to be held soon,” he said. “The PPP is fully prepared for the next general elections even if they are held early. We are very focused in line with the directives and policy of our chairman [Bialwal Bhutto-Zardari];  and we are very much confident to achieve the desired results. But let me tell you, I don’t see PTI anywhere after the next elections. You will not find them here [in Sindh], nor in Punjab, Balochistan and KPK [Khyber Pakhtunkhwa].

"Latif’s disregard for notice shows PML-N in disarray
","October 8, 2021","LAHORE: PML-N MNA Javed Latif has shown ‘no regard’ to the show-cause notice issued to him last month for indirectly criticising party president Shehbaz Sharif as he neither bothered to respond to it nor to a reminder.
Mr Latif was given seven days to reply to the show-cause but despite the passage of three weeks he chose not to respond. A reminder has also been issued to him but to no avail.
“I have sent him (Latif) a reminder to respond to the show-cause notice,” PML-N secretary general Ahsan Iqbal said on Thursday in reply to a Dawn’s query regarding Latif’s ‘reluctance’ to respond to the party notice.
When asked if the party would take action against him (Latif) for violating the party discipline, Mr Iqbal said: “Let him submit a reply.”
PML-N sources insist that since Latif has the blessings of Maryam Nawaz (the party vice president), he simply put the show-cause notice in the dustbin. “Without the direction of someone at the top, Latif could not have dared to remain indifferent to the matter,” a party insider said.
Javed Latif, who had become a confidant of Maryam Nawaz after being jailed, had told a private news channel on Sept 14 last that four to five leaders in the PML-N were on an ‘assignment’ to distort the party’s narrative (respect the ballot). Indirectly referring to Shehbaz, who advocates the narrative of reconciliation (with the Establishment), Latif said “those who are on an assignment talk about reconciliation. I don’t want to name them but when seasoned leaders cause damage to the party’s narrative, this is not possible without an assignment (from the establishment).”
Shehbaz Sharif, the opposition leader in the National Assembly, reportedly took Latif’s comments as his ‘insult’ and boycotted two back-to-back divisional level meetings of the party in Lahore to register his protest with Nawaz Sharif. Later, Nawaz ordered issuance of a show-cause notice to Latif to placate Shehbaz.
On Sept 16, Ahsan Iqbal served him show-cause notice seeking reply within seven days regarding his ‘certain comments and allegations’ about his colleagues in the party. “I am directed by Nawaz Sharif to issue this show-cause notice to you (Latif) and you are called upon to show cause as to why disciplinary action should not be taken against you,” it said.
A senior party leader told Dawn that Latif’s episode had exposed the two groups in the party -- Maryam and Shehbaz. “Although Shehbaz’s protest forced Nawaz to issue show-cause notice, his (Latif’s) stubborn attitude shows that Maryam group prevails over Shehbaz’s. Latif knows that it is not in the power of Shehbaz to either corner him in the party or refuse him a ticket for future elections. As long as he (Latif) has the backing of Maryam, he does not need to apologise to Shehbaz,” he said.
Javed Latif did not respond to Dawn’s queries for his comment.",Pakistan

Holding photos of their martyred children, the parents held a protest demonstration outside Peshawar Press Club on Thursday. 
They chanted slogans against President Arif Alvi, Prime Minister Imran Khan, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmad.
The protesters said that federal government could announce conditional amnesty for TTP members if they gave up their extremist activities and surrender. They said that terrorists had taken lives of innocent people and they did not deserve any amnesty.
They said that ministers had soft corner for TTP which deeply hurt the parents of APS martyrs. “The rulers don’t realise what decisions they are going to take. 
The killers of our children, personnel of law enforcement agencies and other Pakistanis do not deserve any kind of pardon,” they said.
The protesters also expressed their anguish over the escape of Ihsanullah Ihsan from custody, saying the Taliban spokesman himself admitted to be a facilitator in army public school tragedy but he escaped safely to surprise of the people.

He said that TTP was directly involved in merciless killing of the people including the students. He added that government should avoid adopting equivocal policy about the terrorists.
“The government will satisfy us as to who is killer of our children,” he said and added that the parents wanted nothing else except justice. He said that if the terrorists were pardoned then the APS victims’ families would hold the government responsible for neglecting the sacrifices of people, who lost their lives during the war against terrorism.

"Minar-i-Pakistan assault case: Police arrest 8 suspects, including victim's associate
","October 8, 2021","Lahore Police claimed on Friday to have arrested eight suspects on charges of assaulting a female TikToker, Ayesha Akram, and her team at Lahore's Greater Iqbal Park on Independence Day. 
According to Lahore Investigation DIG Shariq Jamal Khan, the recent arrests have been made on the basis of a supplementary statement submitted by Akram in writing. 
In an earlier development, police had released 98 suspects after Akram and her companions had 
 them during an identity parade.
In her recent statement, Akram nominated 13 suspects, including her associate Amir Sohail alias Rambo, who had accompanied her to Greater Iqbal Park on the day of the incident. Sohail is among the eight arrested suspects. 
She held Sohail responsible for the incident, in which she and her companions were harassed and assaulted by a large crowd. 
Akram told police that Sohail had planned the incident, further accusing him and some of his companions of recording her obscene videos. She said Sohail had been using those videos to blackmail her and had extorted Rs1 million from her till now.
""I have been giving half of my salary to him,"" she said, adding that Sohail, along with one of his partners, Badshah, had been running a ""TikTok gang"".
DIG Khan assured that the remaining suspects would be arrested soon and that further investigation into the case would be carried out according to the law.
The case had surfaced when a video of a crowd of men harassing and assaulting Akram and her companions had gone viral. 
The footage showed the attackers laughing at Akram and using abusive language. The offenders had surrounded around her, ripped her clothes off and groped her. Though a few men were trying to rescue her, the crowd of offenders was so large that she was struggling helplessly to avoid attacks, the footage showed. 
Subsequently, Lahore police had registered a case against hundreds of unidentified persons for assaulting and stealing from Akram.
In the FIR registered at the Lorry Adda police station, a copy of which is available with 
, the complainant stated that she, along with six companions, was filming a video near Minar-i-Pakistan on Independence Day when around 300 to 400 people ""attacked"" them.
She said that she and her companions had made a lot of effort to escape from the crowd. Observing the situation, the park's security guard had opened the gate to the enclosure around Minar-i-Pakistan, the FIR quoted her as saying.
""However, the crowd was huge and people were scaling the enclosure and coming towards us. People were pushing and pulling me to the extent that they tore my clothes. Several people tried to help me but the crowd was too huge and they kept throwing me in the air,"" she said.
She further stated that her companions were also assaulted. During the struggle, her ring and earrings were ""forcibly taken"", besides a mobile phone of one of her companions, his identity card and Rs15,000 that he had on his person.
""The unidentified persons assaulted us violently,"" the complainant added.
The FIR was registered under sections 354 A (assault or use of criminal force against woman and stripping her of her clothes), 382 (theft after preparation made for causing death, hurt or restraint in order to commit the theft), 147 (rioting) and 149 (unlawful assembly) of the Pakistan Penal Code.",Pakistan
"Crisis lingers as govt yet to notify new ISI chief
","October 14, 2021","ISLAMABAD: Following the 
 between the civil and military leadership on the issue of appointment of new Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Director General, Prime Minister Imran Khan on Wednesday received a summary carrying names of candidates for one of the most powerful slots in the country.
A federal minister, who did not want to be named, told 
 that the premier received the summary that carried names for the office of DG ISI.
Also, the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) reprimanded its chief whip in the National Assembly Amir Dogar for disclosing details of the Monday night meeting of the PM with Chief of the Army Staff Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa followed by Mr Khan’s remarks at the cabinet meeting on Tuesday. He reportedly received a show-cause notice from the party.
Federal Minister for Information Fawad Chaudhry on Wednesday tweeted that consultation between the PM and COAS on the appointment of a new DG ISI had been completed and the process for the appointment had begun. “The civil and military leadership has yet again proved that all institutions are united for the country’s stability, integrity and development,” he wrote.
			
While briefing the press about the cabinet meeting, the minister on Tuesday had stated that the prime minister wanted appointment of new DG ISI according to the Constitution.
However, according to experts in defence matters, the procedure for the appointment is not mentioned in the Constitution or the Army Act, and all past appointments were made as per traditions under which the army chief proposes three names to the premier who then makes a final decision.
Last week, the military’s media affairs wing, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) had 
 that Lt Gen Nadeem Ahmed Anjum had been appointed the new ISI chief whereas Lt Gen Faiz Hameed had been posted as Peshawar corps commander.
Since a notification of the appointment had not been issued by the PM Office for next couple of days, it led to feverish speculation in the federal capital, compelling the government to break its silence on the issue. The information minister then on Tuesday told the presser that PM Khan and the COAS had a “long sitting” last night to discuss the matter after which the premier took the cabinet into confidence on the issue.
Meanwhile, Mr Dogar disclosed that the PM informed the federal cabinet that he had told the army chief that he wanted the DG ISI to continue for some time due to the critical situation in the neighbouring country.
“The prime minister has the authority to appoint the DG ISI and he held a detailed meeting with COAS Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa in this regard,” stated Mr Chaudhry earlier at the presser. “The federal government will follow a legal and constitutional procedure on the appointment of the DG ISI,” he said.
The minister categorically stated there would be no step taken from the PM Office or the military setup that damaged the repute of one another.",Pakistan
"Bank deposits jump by 17.4pc on record remittances
","October 14, 2021","KARACHI: As bank deposits grew by 17.4 per cent during the last 12 months, the investments in risk-free government securities also rose with higher percentage compared to advances.
The half-yearly report of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) issued on Wednesday showed that the total deposits of the scheduled banks soared to Rs19.828 trillion in September from Rs16­.886tr in September 2020, an increase of Rs2,942 billion.
The banks remained liquid during the last 12 months due to record growth in the remittances which ultimately translated into local currency and found place in banks. However, the major growth was recorded during the first nine months (January-September) of the calendar year 2021 as deposits increased by Rs2,743bn or 16pc.
Banks are inclined to invest in government papers that earn them risk-free high returns. The total investment of the schedule banks rose 27pc to Rs14.096tr in September from Rs11.090tr in September 2020, an increase of Rs3006bn.
During 9MCY21, the total investment increased by Rs2,676bn or 23.4 per cent. The banks earned huge profits during the calendar year 2020 due to higher rates of returns on government papers.
However, the advances didn’t go up like investments during the 12-month period under review. The SBP reported that the bank advances increased by Rs1,192bn, or 14.7pc, to Rs9.286tr in September compared to Rs8.094tr in September 2020.
However, the bank advances increased by Rs819bn or 9.6pc in 9MCY21. Bankers said the advances never increase like investments as the risk is high. It was also noted that during the 12- month period Covid-19 was also a reason for cautious approach adopted by the banks amid economic uncertainty.
Bankers said the bank deposits would grow further as the country had received record $8bn remittances during the first quarter of 2021-22.
The investment by the banks remained high despite steep cut in the interest rate which ultimately reduced the returns on government papers. However, the advances did not go up despite low interest rate.
The central bank had slashed the interest rate from 13.25pc in March 2020 to 7pc in June 2020, but the uncertainty of Covid-19 did not encourage the borrowers to benefit from the low-cost of money.",Newspaper
"Non-traditional exports to traditional markets surge by 60pc: ministry
","October 14, 2021","ISLAMABAD: The export of non-traditional products to traditional markets posted a growth of 60 per cent, suggesting a greater degree of product diversification over the past five years.
Traditional markets are European countries, US and Afghanistan while non-traditional markets are African countries and Central Asian states. Pakistan’s traditional products are cotton-based textile products and rice while non-traditional products are engineering goods, tractors, and certain fruits.
The commerce ministry carried out a comparison of three years (2015-2018) of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz government with the current year (2020-21) of the PTI government.
The data was shared during a meeting presided over by Adviser to the Prime Minister on Commerce Abdul Razak Dawood here on Wednesday.
According to an official announcement, the analysis shows that the export of traditional products increased by 7pc with a net increase of $1.028 billion. In the same traditional markets, the export of non-traditional products increased by 60pc, a net increase of $2.022bn in value.
A similar change was observed in terms of geographical diversification. The export of traditional products to non-traditional markets decreased by 1pc or $33 million. In contrast, the export of non-traditional products to non-traditional markets increased by 77pc or $713m.
The meeting was informed that diversification of exports is an important pillar of Pakistan’s export strategy and the commerce ministry has launched a number of initiatives aimed at product and market diversification of exports, including Look Africa Policy, Reconnect Silk Route Policy for Central Asian Republics and Drawback of Local Taxes and Levies.
The meeting was told that the ministry is focusing both on diversification within the traditional product sectors like technical textiles and other specialised product sectors where currently there is little or no export but there exists immense export potential. In addition, the ministry is also focusing on diversification into non-traditional product sectors.
The adviser said that product export diversification had to be coupled with geographical diversification to new markets like Africa and South America. He said the policy had just begun to show results but there was still a long way to go.",Newspaper

"Tensions soar as police clash with Serbs in Kosovo
","October 14, 2021","			
MITROVICA: Several police and ethnic Serbs were injured in fresh clashes on Wednesday in northern Kosovo in raids targeting smuggled goods, sparking fresh tensions in the already uneasy region beset by ethnic strife.
The violence prompted an urgent call for calm from the EU, and comes in the wake of a weeks-long standoff between Serbia and Kosovo over 
, marking the lowest point in ties in a decade.
Wednesday’s unrest came as police launched raids in four regions of Kosovo aimed at people smuggling Serbian-origin goods into the country. Ethnically-divided Mitrovica town saw the worst unrest, as one ethnic Serb suffered serious gunshot wounds and several others were lightly injured, said Zlatan Elek, the head of a hospital in town.
Police said six officers were injured in clashes and eight people were arrested.
A police statement said the raids were carried out at several locations, including homes, businesses and warehouses and smuggled goods worth “hundreds of thousands of euros” were seized. The operation provoked anger among ethnic Serbs, hundreds of whom blocked roads in Mitrovica — which is split with Serbs in the north and Albanians in the south — and nearby Zvecan. Police used tear gas and stunt grenades to disperse them.
In north Mitrovica the protesters set two vehicles on fire and hurled stones at police.
According to police, the crowd used “stunt grenades, firearms and hand grenades to prevent and attack customs and police officers on duty”.
The latest unrest follows a spike in tensions last month between the longtime foes.
They faced off for nearly two weeks after Kosovo banned cars with Serbian registration plates from entering its territory — mirroring a years-long Serbian practice against vehicles travelling the other way.
Kosovo dispatched special police units to oversee the ban’s implementation, angering local Serbs who blocked the roads leading to the border.",Newspaper
"SHC orders setting up of girls medical college at Mohatta Palace
","October 14, 2021","KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Wednesday ruled that Qasr-e-Fatima, commonly known as Mohatta Palace, would be used to set up a medical and dental college for girls.
The order came on a long-standing dispute over the heritage property of late Fatima Jinnah in Clifton. 
A single-judge bench of SHC headed by Justice Zulfiqar Ahmad Khan ordered that the college would also have a hostel as both the plaintiffs and defendants agreed to amicably settle the dispute and accorded their consent to establish the medical and dental college.
The matter was adjourned till Nov 1 as both sides also recommended the names of some retired judges and prominent doctors and relatives of late Miss Jinnah to be part of a trust to run the affair of the proposed medical college.
However, the fate of the Mohatta Palace Museum, which is funded by the government, remains unclear.
A suit was filed in 1971 by Hussain Waliji, a relative of Miss Jinnah about the administration of her moveable and immovable properties including Qasr-e-Fatima.
After the death of Mr Waliji, his son Amir Ali became the plaintiff, but he had also passed away during the pendency of the suit and then his legal heirs had become the part of proceedings.
The litigation was initiated after the award of a succession certificate of such properties to Shireen Jinnah, the only surviving sister of Fatima Jinnah after her death on July 10, 1967. The Shireen Jinnah Charitable Trust was made as one of the defendants in the lawsuit.
On the last hearing, lawyers for both sides — relatives of Fatima Jinnah (plaintiffs) and the Shireen Jinnah Charitable Trust (defendants) — had informed the bench that they had considered the matter and progressed to amicably settle the long-standing dispute with regard to the property left by Miss Jinnah, and had exchanged certain proposals.
A provincial law officer also submitted that now both sides were moving towards implementation of the wishes of late Miss Jinnah as translated through the trust deed where it was desired that the premises of Qasr-e-Fatima will be used for the establishment of a modern medical college exclusively for girls and an attached hospital for free treatment of underprivileged persons/patients.
Thereafter, the bench had asked the provincial law officer to go through the various orders of the court and file a statement as to what assistance could be provided to achieve the ends of using the property in question as per the desires of its owners Fatima Jinnah and Shireen Jinnah.
Earlier, a counsel had drawn the attention of the bench to an order of the SHC passed in 1996 to dig out other assets left by Miss Jinnah which were allegedly handed out to the trustees through the declaration instrument on which a report was filed by the official assignee in the same year listing certain personal properties of Quaid-i-Azam and Miss Jinnah. 
They sought an updated report from the official assignee in this regard, thus the bench had directed the official assignee to provide an updated list in this matter to reach to a just conclusion.
One of the counsel had also referred to an earlier order of the SHC issued in 1993 in terms of which it was ordered that the provincial government would deposit a sum of Rs61,188,000 with the official assignee as tentative sale price of Qasr-e-Fatima and asserted that upon the request of the Sindh government the property was handed over to it for repair and maintenance only.
The lawyer further referring to various earlier orders, pointed out that initial sum of Rs61 million through a cheque was deposited with the court nazir in 1994 by the provincial government that undertook to deposit the balance amount of Rs188,000 within a week, but it had deposited the remaining amount in 1996. Using such amount, the nazir had purchased Defence Savings Certificates (DSC) and Special Savings Certificates (SSC) which were still lying with him.
The nazir had informed the court that the principle profit accrued on DSC was Rs608,500 till Nov 2, 2004, and SSC was Rs399,959,500 till Jan 16, 2013. 
He further submitted in a report filed in September 2015 that the profit on the DSC for the period of 10 years and on the SSC for the period of two and half years was due.
It may be recalled that on a previous order, the bench had granted a request of the plaintiff’s counsel with regard to calling the property as Qasr-e-Fatima instead of Mohatta Palace in government documents.
It had ordered the provincial government and other defendants to ensure that the said property continued to be named, tagged, labelled and described as Qasr-e-Fatima only and all the documents wherein any other name was used to describe the said property should be corrected.",Pakistan
"PM orders setting up of leopard preservation zone on Margalla Hills
","October 14, 2021","ISLAMABAD: In view of the increasing leopard population in the Margalla Hills range, Prime Minister Imran Khan on Wednesday directed that a preservation zone be set up in the hills to ensure natural habitat for the endangered species.
The prime minister also approved establishment of the Wildlife Information Centre in Marghazar Zoo.
The decisions were taken in a meeting of the committee on climate change presided over by Prime Minister Imran Khan.
According to the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB), the population of leopards in the Margalla Hills was 
 and the animal was frequently spotted by visitors of hiking trails, especially on trails 4 and 6.
The IWMB with the assistance of the Capital Development Authority (CDA) is installing fences and gates around trail 4, which will be closed after sunset. Trail 4 was opened earlier in January to control crowding on other trails and monitor illegal wood cutting.
“The special leopard zone will provide a healthy eco-system to predators, permanently inhabiting the hills,” the prime minister was quoted as saying in an official press release issued by the PM Office.
Prime Minister Khan, in principle, also accorded approval to the National Climate Change Policy, 2021 and the National Wildlife Policy, 2021.
He directed setting up of a think-tank to coordinate efforts among various ministries and devise out-of-the-box solutions for climate change mitigation. He also said Pakistan had established its credibility as a ‘Green Champion’ due to its flagship ‘Ten Billion Tree programme’, initiated by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government.
Mr Khan said the international community was acknowledging Pakistan’s realistic and tangible steps to mitigate impacts of climate change and directed the Ministry of Climate Change to review targets and formulate new goals, aimed at fast-tracking the steps required to preserve the natural environment.
“Preservation of the country’s national parks is paramount and stressed the need for inducting trained manpower and utilising modern technology,” he added.
The prime minister appreciated the efforts of Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Climate Change Malik Amin Aslam for environmental protection and highlighting Pakistan’s efforts in this field.
Earlier, Amin Aslam briefed the meeting about the nationally-determined contributions, climate change and national wildlife policies as well as green climate diplomacy.
The meeting was attended by federal ministers Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Syed Fakhar Imam, Mohammad Hamad Azhar and Chaudhry Moonis Elahi, National Security Adviser Dr Moeed Yousaf, Minister of State for Climate Change Zartaj Gul, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Dr Shehbaz Gill, Balochistan Chief Minister Jam Kamal Khan and Gilgit-Baltistan Chief Minister Khalid Khursheed.
Chief ministers of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sardar Usman Buzdar and Mehmood Khan; Azad Kashmir Prime Minister Sardar Abdul Qayyum Niazi and Sindh Environment Minister Ismail Rahu joined the meeting via video-link.
The IWMB observed that unlike Ayubia, no case of attacks on livestock had been reported in the Margallas within the federal capital’s jurisdiction because there was a significant wild boar and monkey population along with barking deer in the area.
The board also observed that there were five leopards in the hills which was testament to the fact that the national park had a healthy eco-system. It also cautioned visitors on trails 4 and 6 to be careful and urged the public to trek and hike in groups and return before sunset as the leopards roam between these trails, sleep through the day and come out after dark.
“In case hikers do come face to face with a leopard, running is not an option; instead one should freeze and show no signs of fear,” the board advised.
A few months ago, the IWMB released images of a female common leopard named Shezadi found to be a permanent resident of the territory between trails 4 and 6 inside Margalla Hills National Park. Shezadi was caught on camera after traps were set up by the IWMB staff for several evenings in a row in late January. Leopards patrol and control 50 square km of the territory.
The common leopard is a critically endangered species and top predator of the park and is also very territorial by nature.",Pakistan
"Afghan pomegranate pickers jobless as fruits rot at shuttered border with Pakistan
","October 14, 2021","Afghanistan's festive pomegranate season has begun, but this year thousands of tonnes of the juicy red fruit risk rotting on trucks blocked at the frequently shuttered border with Pakistan — leaving thousands of farm workers unemployed.
With its tart and crunchy, ruby-red seeds locked inside a leathery red rind, the pomegranate is renowned for its health benefits, and is one of the most important crops in the country's south.
But the fruit is ripening as Afghanistan finds itself engulfed in a multitude of crises that have metastasised since the Taliban seized control two months ago.
 
“We have 15,000 farm workers in this region who have been laid off because the trade has been paralysed and the fruit is rotting,” Haji Nani Agha, who heads the Fresh Fruits Union in Kandahar, told 
.
In the shade of pomegranate shrubs, the melon-sized fruits fill burlap bags and crates being loaded onto trucks soon to head towards the Spin Boldak border with Pakistan.
But there their voyage comes to a halt.
Islamabad has 
 on imported fruits to zero in a bid to boost trade from its neighbour, but also tightened controls on ordinary Afghans trying to cross over, fearing illegal entries.
It has caused a tug-of-war between Pakistani authorities and Afghanistan's new rulers, who have frequently closed the border in protest.
Exporters hoping to sell their wares have found themselves stuck for days and even weeks in scorching heat.
“It is a catastrophe for all of Afghanistan, because all of Afghan trade goes through this border,” Agha said.
Usually, between 40,000 and 50,000 tonnes are exported across this border to Pakistan, and also on to India and the Gulf states each year.
But so far, only 4,490 tonnes have left the country, according to Abdul Baqi Beena of the Chamber of Commerce in the southern city of Kandahar.
“These products are waiting to be sold, but the more they are delayed, the more their quality deteriorates and the more their sale value plummets,” he said.
Even before the dramatic power shift, Afghanistan's agriculture sector had been hard-hit by drought and intense fighting in a number of provinces.
For years, the previous Western-backed Afghan governments and international donors tried to convince farmers to give up farming poppies for illegal opium production and instead grow fruit — such as pomegranates.",World
"Tarin hopeful on success of IMF negotiations, says encouraging progress made
","October 14, 2021","Federal Minister for Finance Shaukat Tarin on Wednesday expressed hope that top-level negotiations between Pakistan and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) would be successful and the $6 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) would be put back on track.
“I believe that the progress we have made to date is really encouraging and as we say, God willing, I see this happening now in this visit,” he said in an interview at the United States Institute of Peace.
The minister said that the concluding sixth round of talks with the IMF was the most important part of his visit to the US, adding that many virtual meetings had already taken place while the technical level discussions had also 
.
He said, at the final stage, meetings would be held with seniors at the IMF, including the Fund's managing director.
			
The minister said his government believed that IMF’s demand to increase power tariffs would trigger inflation, adding that this point was made in the technical discussion with the Fund, which was also informed that the increase in tariff would be made in a gradual manner so that it does not have an abrupt impact on inflation.
Tarin said that there were some problems in the power sector, including excess capacity, for which the government had to pay, adding that the performance of distribution and generation companies was also being improved. He said all this was being successfully negotiated with the IMF.
The minister said that there was no stagnation in growth and the Pakistani economy would grow by over five per cent during the fiscal year 2021-22.
He said that back in the 1960s, Pakistan’s economy was the fourth-largest in Asia. However, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's nationalisation policy and the Afghan war in 1979 disrupted economic growth, he added.
Tarin said Prime Minister Imran Khan took over an economy that was struggling in 2018 with a $20bn current account deficit, unsustainable fiscal deficit, adding that the premier had to go for a tough IMF programme besides taking some politically unpopular decisions including currency devaluation, increasing the discount rate and increasing utility prices.
The minister said that as the country’s economy started consolidating and growing, the Covid-19 pandemic hit the world.
However, it was skillfully dealt with by the government as was indicated by the far lesser human and economic losses caused by the pandemic in Pakistan compared to the rest of the world. He said the government kept investing in two productive sectors, agriculture and industry, as well as housing during Covid-19.
 
He said during FY2021, growth was recorded at over 4pc compared to -0.5pc the previous year, showing a V-shaped recovery.
The minister noted that around 60pc of Pakistan's population is below the age of 30 years. They need jobs, so the government revitalised agriculture, industry, exports and housing, he said. 
However, there was a need to make sure the growth was “not overheated”, he added. 
Tarin said the government was also ensuring that underprivileged people were not ignored and made to wait for the trickledown effect of positive economic growth, which has never reached them for many decades. Hence, the government had utilised bottom-up approaches to ensure sustainable and inclusive growth.
For this purpose, the government was providing interest-free loans to farmers and low-income families besides issuing health cards and giving technical trainings to help around four million households.
The minister said the premier had changed the country's focus from geopolitics to geoeconomics to ensure the economic welfare of people. “This kind of change in focus means everything changes in terms of foreign policy, economic policy, internal security, and whatever else and relationship with neighbours.”
He said Pakistan has good relations with all neighbouring countries, but there were issues with India, which needed to be resolved.
 
Tarin said that there was a fundamental issue between Pakistan and India and that was Kashmir, which he said was a disputed territory as per the United Nations Security Council resolutions.
However, he said the current Indian government was not accepting its disputed nature and had taken some 
, depriving Kashmiris of various rights.
He said that trade and economic activities between India and Pakistan were suffering, adding that PM Imran had told India so many times that if they take one step, Pakistan would take two steps and urged the Indian government to respond positively.
The minister said at the political level, there was a need to provide some space for economics and the welfare of people of both countries.
The finance minister said like all other countries, Pakistan also wanted an inclusive government in Afghanistan and was striving for that.
However, he cautioned that the Taliban were 
 and if the world did not come to support them on humanitarian grounds, there would be complete chaos, which would spill over to Pakistan and other countries.
 
He said that since the Taliban were saying that they would cooperate with the world, become a responsible country, take care of human rights, protect women rights and pledge not to promote terrorism, “we should help them step by step and encourage them to demonstrate improvements in their behaviour.”
Tarin said if the situation in Afghanistan worsened it would affect Pakistan the most. “Pakistan believes if the situation in Afghanistan deteriorates we will directly get affected, ” the minister remarked.
Talking about the security situation in Pakistan, the minister said that Pakistan had fenced its border with Afghanistan, except for a small strip near Chaman while traffic flow to and from Afghanistan had been controlled and security forces were also taking necessary action to maintain security.
Tarin said Pakistan wanted to have friendly relations with every country including the US and China.
He said that Pakistan had a ""major strategic partnership"" with the US and its friendship with China would not affect its relations with the former. 
“We believe we can work with both powers equally.”
The finance minister said that China had helped the country in building infrastructure but that did not mean that Pakistan had become China-centric. 
 
“We are open and want to do business with China, US, Europe, Japan, Korea. We are [an] open country. There should be no misconception,” he pointed out.
On the China Pakistan Economic Corridor, Tarin said Pakistan needed to build infrastructure to attract foreign investments. 
Since Pakistan was not in a position to build such a vast infrastructure, China had provided funds and helped it in building roads, railways, power generation and other utilities that had generated economic activity, the finance minister said.
Responding to a question, he said that there were some projects where companies from China, the US and Pakistan were engaged in joint ventures and collaborating with each other. 
""This cooperation can be enhanced,"" he added.
Tarin stressed that Gwadar port was not China-centric and it was open for use to everyone including the Japanese, South Koreans and Europeans. 
""Gwadar is the right place if anyone wanted to conduct business with African countries or the Central Asian states,"" Tarin said, adding that Gwadar was a ""big opportunity"" as it was a unique territory that covered the Gulf, Central Asian republics and even the distance to China was short from the port.
The finance minister said that the government wanted to attract investment from different counties and that was why it had developed infrastructure. He added that any country could come and invest in Pakistan.
Elaborating on his point, he said Pakistan had been making efforts to attract people from different countries to invest in economic zones and was also 
 for investment purposes.
However, he added that peace and stability in Afghanistan was needed. Tarin said that a stable Afghanistan was good for all and urged the world to help make the country manageable for everyone's benefit.
On the remaining conditions of the Financial Action Task Force, the finance minister said Pakistan had met 26 out of 27 conditions and the 27th one was also half met.
He said that any other country in this situation would have been removed off the grey list but “Pakistan is being punished by some countries for different reasons — not economic reasons.”
 
“Frankly it is [the] same mantra that Pakistan is a terrorist state [and that] Pakistan encourages terrorism,” he said, adding that the country which had lost 80,000 people, suffered $150bn in economic losses and was suffering for 40 years was being continuously blamed.
Tarin said people were being probed for the flight of capital from the country. 
He added that 
 and whoever had done anything wrong would have to face the consequences.
The finance minister said the government was working to reform the entire human resource sector through measures such as bringing in the private sector in key positions in ministries and having a combination of bureaucrats with an understanding of both the government and the private sector.
He said that the Federal Board of Revenue had constituted a committee along these lines, having 50-50 representation from public and private sectors, to move forward efficiently.
He pointed out that Pakistan had jumped 28 places in ease of doing business owing to comprehensive policy decisions. 
Tarin said Prime Minister Imran Khan was himself taking charge and the Board of Investment was reporting directly to him with the premier holding two meetings every month.
The minister also said that Special Economic Zones would be made autonomous to provide a conducive environment for foreign investors. He added that autonomous status would initially be introduced in around six zones within the next 12 months and would later be replicated in other zones.
Tarin said there were around 85 companies being run by the government out of which 15 were making losses of around 1pc of the GDP. These included airlines, railways, steel mills and power distribution companies.
He said that these companies would be disassociated from ministries, their control would be handed over to professional people to overhaul them and they would be privatised within five years. 
The finance minister maintained that in developing countries like Pakistan, the government had ""no job"" running businesses.
The finance minister said that no amount of hurdles would stop the government from making Pakistan economically great again and one of the top countries in Asia and globally. 
""If we make Pakistan one of the top countries economically in Asia [then] that will be an achievement — that is my motivation,"" he said.",Business
"FO slams Indian home minister's 'delusional' statement threatening Pakistan with surgical strikes
","October 14, 2021","The Foreign Office (FO) on Thursday slammed Indian Home Minister Amit Shah's ""irresponsible and provocative"" statement in which he threatened Pakistan with surgical strikes.
""This delusional statement only goes to further demonstrate the BJP-RSS combine’s propensity to stoke regional tensions for both ideological reasons and political expediency, based on enmity towards Pakistan,"" FO spokesperson Asim Iftikhar Ahmad said in a statement.
Earlier today, Indian media reported Shah as saying that India will carry out surgical strikes against Pakistan ""if it transgresses"", adding that the time for talks was over and it was now time to ""reciprocate"".
According to the 
, the minister said that there used to be talks when India's border came under attack, but now Delhi gives a befitting reply to terrorist attacks.
Shah made the comments while referring to the alleged surgical strike India had carried out in 2016, a claim that was 
 by Pakistan.
""The surgical strike under Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and former defence minister Manohar Parrikar was an important step. We sent out a message that no one can disturb India's borders. There was a time for talks, but now is the time to reciprocate,"" the report quoted Shah as saying.
			
According to 
, Shah — who was addressing the foundation laying ceremony of a university in Goa's Dharbandora — also added: ""The surgical strikes proved that we don't tolerate attacks. More will come if you transgress.""
Responding to the claims made by the Indian minister, the FO spokesperson said that such statements serve as smokescreens to divert global attention from India's state terrorism, and systematic human rights violations in occupied Kashmir and against minorities in India.
""Pakistan has repeatedly drawn the attention of the international community to India’s sinister designs of staging 'false flag' operations to implicate Pakistan and Kashmiris.
""While Pakistan is a peace-loving country, we will spare no effort in resolutely thwarting any aggressive designs,"" the FO spokesperson added.
Pakistan’s swift response to India’s Balakot misadventure in 2019 — including the downing of Indian combat aircraft and the capture of an Indian Air Force pilot — fully demonstrated the will, capacity and preparedness of our armed forces to deter Indian aggression, he concluded.
In 2016, at least two Pakistan Army soldiers were killed as Indian troops fired across the LoC in Azad Jammu and Kashmir. 
Indian officials had claimed that surgical strikes were conducted by the Indian army on ""terror launch pads along the LoC"". However, the Pakistan Army had rubbished the claims and called it a ""fabrication of the truth"".
Similarly, on Feb 26, 2019, India had tried to launch a similar operation against Pakistan but had failed and two of its planes had been shot down by the Pakistan Air Force.

"TV channel apologises to Ishaq Dar over ‘fabricated’ graft charges
","October 19, 2021","LONDON: Private channel 
, the broadcaster of 
, has issued an apology to former finance minister Ishaq Dar and said its allegations of corruption and misuse of authority against the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader were fabricated. 
The defamatory remarks were made in two news shows aired by the channel on July 8, 2019 and Aug 8, 2019. In the latter programme, 
, ""accountability tsar"" Shahzad Akbar had alleged that Mr Dar had managed and actively impeded the work of the Financial Monitoring Unit in Pakistan by preventing institutions from accessing the systems. It was also alleged that Mr Dar had taken these steps to “protect individuals involved in the Choudhury Sugar Mills money laundering case”. 
In a statement of apology aired on Monday by 
 at 6pm, 
 said it accepts that “[Mr Dar] never managed the Financial Monitoring Unit… never impeded [its] work, nor did he do anything to protect anybody in any case including the alleged Choudhury Sugar Mills case”. 
“We unconditionally apologise to Mr Ishaq Dar for the significant distress, upset and embarrassment which these broadcasts have caused him,” the channel said in the statement. 
			
Sources told 
 Mr Dar issued proceedings against the channel for these defamatory statements in July 2020, and served a claim in the UK High Court in November the same year. On March 2, 2021, 
 made an offer for amends — a procedure introduced by the UK’s Defamation Act 1996, whereby a defendant in an action for defamation may make a written offer to publish an apology and pay damages. Acceptance of such an offer terminates defamation proceedings and parties settle between themselves. 
In his claim, Mr Dar had maintained that the imputations conveyed by the publication constitute “very serious defamatory allegations of which the claimant is reported to be guilty as a matter of fact” and had caused serious harm. 
Along with a restriction and apology, Mr Dar had claimed damages for libel of around GBP 200,000 along with legal costs. 
A transcript of Shahzad Akbar’s claims on the show, which were a subject of the defamation claim, quotes the special assistant to the prime minister on accountability as saying that Mr Dar did not allow the FMU to function, adding that he had “paralysed the institution’. He also alleged that after Mr Dar’s departure, the unit was “brought back to life” and that allegedly blocked files of politically-exposed persons were accessed. These allegations now stand retracted, and the channel has maintained that it accepts Mr Dar’s position. 
In a statement shared with 
, Mr Dar said he has been vindicated and that the allegations made against him were “false, mala fide and evil”. 
Mr Dar said this development proves “how Mohammad Nawaz Sharif and his party colleagues have been subjected to political engineering and malicious campaign of lies”. 
“I have never been involved in corruption or any unlawful activity and never used any influence against any institution. The allegations made by the pro-government media house and Shahzad Akbar were aimed at damaging my reputation but Allah SWT has been most kind and the TV channel has accepted in the UK judicial process that the allegations were fabricated, false and untrue. The TV channel has accepted that I was maligned and nothing wrong has been done by me.”",Pakistan

","October 19, 2021","PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Mahmood Khan on Monday ordered the establishment of citizen facilitation centres (CFCs) in the capital city and divisional headquarters of the province.
He was chairing a meeting regarding the initiatives to be launched under the e-governance strategy.
The participants included minister for science and information technology Mohammad Atif Khan, special assistants to the chief minister Kamran Khan Bangash and Arif Ahmedzai, and senior relevant officials, according to a statement issued here.
The chief minister directed the officials to ensure the establishment of a model CFC in the provincial capital in three months and divisional headquarters in six months.
He set the one-month deadline to the relevant quarters for the launch of e-summary system to improve the efficiency of government departments and reduce the time involving the manual system of summary approval.

"FDI coming from US exceeds Chinese inflows in 1QFY22
","October 19, 2021","KARACHI: Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) from the United States surpassed inflows from China during the first quarter of the ongoing fiscal year (1QFY22), data released by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Monday showed.  
FDI from the US jumped to $100.9 million during July-Sept FY22 compared to $19.7m in the same period of last year. Inflows from China have shrunk in 1QFY22 despite the neighbouring country being the largest investor and biggest trade partner of Pakistan. 
The five-time higher FDI inflows from the US in 1QFY22 are encouraging for the country while at the same time a significant decline of FDI from China is worrisome. 
The FDI from China declined by 50 per cent in 1QFY22, down to $76.9m compared to $154.9m during the same period of FY21. Reports appearing in the media pointed towards slow progress in China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. However, both Pakistan and China have denied these reports.  
Pakistan is keen to develop economic relations with China which has become its biggest trade partner. Most of the trade is in favour of China. Exports from Pakistan witnessed slow progress during the last three years. The FDI during the last few years was dominated by China and contributed in the range of 40-50pc of the total inflows.  
A four per cent decline in the total inflows of FDI reflected some improvement during the first quarter compared to last year. The country received $439m during the 1QFY22 compared to $457m in the same period in FY21. During the first two months of FY22, FDI declined by 20pc reflecting no improvement on this sector except that China increased FDI.  
FDI inflows in September improved and rose to $236m compared to $202m in the same month of the previous year. 
Other important inflows were $60m from the Netherlands, $49.7m from the United Arab Emirates, $30.3m from the United Kingdom and $34.8m from Hong Kong. 
Despite record remittances and higher exports, the confidence of foreign investor could not be restored. Experts and industrialists blame unfriendly economic policies for investors along with 
, corruption and turmoil in the geopolitical situation of the region for low confidence. 
Interestingly, investors have found it easier to invest in India and Bangladesh in the same region. FDI has been increasing in the two countries. In India, the FDI increased by 27pc to $64 billion in 2020 from $51bn in 2019.  
The FDI during the last three years could not even reach $2.5bn in Pakistan; it was $947m in FY19, $2.315bn in FY20 and $2.056bn in FY21 showing the poor investment climate in the country. 
The outflow of portfolio investment was $100m during 1QFY22, slightly lower compared to an outflow of $108m in the same period of FY21. 
Power sector attracted highest FDI worth $131m while communications received $88.4m which included 24m for telecommunications and $64m for Information Technology. Financial business attracted $100.5m in the same quarter.",Newspaper
"Govt to issue Panda bond by March next year
","October 19, 2021","KARACHI: The government is going to issue a Panda bond — a renminbi-denominated debt instrument sold by a non-Chinese issuer within China — by March 2022, according to Muhammad Umar Zahid, director general for debt at the Ministry of Finance.
Speaking to members of the CFA Society Pakistan on Monday, Mr Zahid said the federal government was also looking to issue Eurobonds as well as sukuk and green bonds in the current fiscal year to bridge its financing gap.
“We’ll now maintain our presence in the international capital markets on a regular basis,” he said.
Of the expected federal fiscal deficit of Rs4 trillion in 2021-22, the government is determined to finance Rs1.5tr through external borrowing. 
Giving the expected breakdown of external financing, he said the government would raise Rs0.34tr through Eurobonds. About Rs0.11tr will be raised through sukuk/green bonds/Panda bonds while Rs1.05tr will flow from multilateral and bilateral sources.
The rest of Rs2.5tr financing needs in 2021-22 will be met through domestic sources, including Rs1tr of the local sukuk.
Responding to a question about the timing of domestic Islamic bonds, the top official in the debt management department said he was waiting for approval from the Sharia committee of the central bank.
“We have a list of assets from the NHA (National Highway Authority) available. These are various motorways. We have three airports — Multan, Islamabad and Lahore — that we’re getting valuated... Once we get the valuation, we’ll announce a proper issuance calendar for the entire fiscal year,” he said, noting that the government could opt for raising more than Rs1tr through the sukuk if market conditions were favourable.
Mr Zahid said there was no cause for concern as far as foreign debt repayments of approximately $14 billion in 2021-22 were concerned.
“This number may not be that high when we bifurcate it into refinancing and the new requirement,” he said, noting that as much as $9bn would likely be rolled over.
“The only thing that needs to be worried about is $5bn maturity, which is $1bn from Eurobonds/sukuk... and the rest of the maturity is due on the multilateral and bilateral portfolios,” he added.
He said as much as 78 per cent of the country’s total external public debt of $86.4bn happens to be from multilateral and bilateral sources on concessional terms i.e. low cost and long tenor.
He acknowledged that the commercial portion of the country’s external public debt — comprising Eurobonds and loans from foreign banks — witnessed a jump from 18pc of the total in 2019-20 to 22pc in 2020-21. “We issued Eurobonds of around $2.5bn and also raised money through commercial banks and Naya Pakistan Certificates,” he said.
Mr Zahid said he could “assure the market that things are moving in a positive direction” with regard to the ongoing negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the stalled loan programme. In the unlikely case of failed negotiations, he said, Plan B is “to increase our flows from the commercial sources, like bond issuances and commercial loans from foreign banks.”
Responding to a question, he said one-rupee depreciation in the exchange rate increases the external debt by Rs86bn. “If the rate depreciates by Rs10, Rs860bn is added to the external debt portfolio.”",Newspaper

"PPP squanders away public money on party’s programmes, say PTI leaders
","October 19, 2021","KARACHI: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf leaders on Monday called the Pakistan Peoples Party’s rally at Bagh-i-Jinnah a complete failure in terms of participation of people and criticised the ruling party of the province for squandering away public money on the party’s programmes and putting all government resources at its disposal. 
The PPP had brought their supporters on dozens of buses from rural parts of the province to make its show a success but it completely failed to attract Karachiites who rejected the party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari’s claims of enjoying widespread support in the metropolis, said Leader of the Opposition in the Sindh Assembly, Haleem Adil Sheikh, and PTI Karachi president and MPA Khurram Sher Zaman at separate press conferences here.  
“The PPP is responsible for growing poverty and increasing sense of deprivation among people of Sindh,” said Sheikh at his office.  
“I call them [PPP leaders] economic terrorists who are not worthy of inheriting Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto’s party. The PPP rally at Bagh-i-Jinnah ground was not a public meeting but an exclusive gathering of Sindh government employees, who were threatened to ensure their participation in the meet or face consequences,” he said.  
He said that despite liberally using government resources on the Oct 17 rally, most of the Bagh-i-Jinnah remained empty hence dozens of buses and other vehicles were parked along the main road to hoodwink people into thinking that the ground must be filled with people. 
“There was no participation of people from Korangi, Orangi, West, East, South, Keamari and Lyari in the rally,” said Sheikh who was flanked by Sindh Assembly member Saeed Afridi and other PTI leaders.  
“The PPP workers are angry with their party as the families of those who were killed in Karsaz twin blasts tragedy were neglected by the party and most of them are now facing hunger and poverty. Instead of paying tribute to martyrs, Bilawal and his men were dancing to the tunes of music,” he said.  
MPA Khurram Sher Zaman said at a separate press conference at party headquarters Insaf House that PPP leaders should stop making fool of people in the name of democracy and lie about their checkered past.  
He held the party, which had been ruling the province for the past 13 years, responsible for the chronic issues of price hike, poverty, social injustice and deteriorating condition of government departments. 
He said the Sindh government had failed on every front and only the party leadership, not the province, had attained prosperity. The PPP, he said, after having realised reputation of Asif Ali Zardari and his front-men among masses had been trying to project Bialwal Bhutto-Zardari as a future leader but he had failed miserably to create any impact on people. 
“Even in his address yesterday, he spent more time on criticism of Prime Minister Imran Khan and failed to share details about his government’s performance, which shows he has nothing to show off except legends of corruption.  
“They are such an anti-progress party that they neither do any good for people themselves nor allow centre to serve masses on the pretext of the 18th Amendment. But in fact, they just want to keep people of Sindh poor and helpless and thereby strengthen their rule,” he remarked.",Pakistan
"Violations by trekkers increase risk of human encounter with leopards in Margalla Hills
","October 19, 2021","ISLAMABAD: A recent risk of increased human-wildlife conflict in Margalla Hills National Park (MHNP) due to repeated violations by residents of the area, particularly students, has emerged.
This was highlighted by Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB) Chairperson Rina Saeed Khan recently. The IWMB has placed clear markings and signs denoting “Ecologically Sensitive Area” with a clear warning that anyone found violating the restriction would be handed over to the police under section 21 of the Islamabad Wildlife (Conservation, Preservation, and Protection) Ordinance, 1979.
In a recent tweet, the IWMB chairperson shared pictures of violators trying to enter the restricted area.
She wrote, “If you see these signs on MHNP trails PLZ DO NOT ENTER NO GO AREA! We are fed up of trekkers illegally entering into closed off areas.”
She pointed out that most of the violators were students of a hostel located near Trail 6 and asked them to respect the law. Section 144 could be implemented in the area and this would completely ban entry or gathering of any individual in the proximity of Trail 6.
In February 2021, around five common leopards including a female identified as Shezadi were spotted in the camera trap visuals of IWMB installed in Trail 4 and 6. This first indicated the 
 of the top predator in the national park. The MHNP has successfully emerged as a model of ecosystem restoration and wildlife habitat conservation after a thriving population of common Asian leopards have been reported in the park.
Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) on Climate Change Malik Amin Aslam said the prime minister gave the go-ahead for 
 in the MHNP, which would restrict public intervention through limited and guided safari tours in the future.
Pakistan Wildlife Foundation Vice President Safwan Ahmed told this agency that leopards were nocturnal animals that hunt at dawn and dusk mostly after sunset and before sunrise. “Leopards are very shy in nature and a solitary animal that desist from having encounters with humans,” he said, adding however, timings after Asr prayers, most likely after 3:30pm in winters and 5pm in summers were when the animals awoke. People should leave MHNP during these times as this could lead to an unpleasant encounter, he added. ",Pakistan
"The lamp of guidance
","October 19, 2021","THE blessed birth of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) in Rabiul Awwal is celebrated by Muslim communities across the globe, particularly in South Asia, with great fervour and reverence. In Pakistan, efforts have been initiated at the state level to set up a 
, using a title of the Holy Prophet used in the Quran (Surah Anbiya).
While devotion and attachment with the blessed name of the Noble Messenger is necessary, equally important for those seeking to learn from his glorious example is to follow the moral precepts he gave, as elucidated in the Quran and the authentic ahadith. If we fail to do this, our devotion is at most half-hearted.
Of course the Holy Quran is replete with moral teachings revealed to the Holy Prophet by the Almighty. It is another matter entirely that we who form part of his ummah have mostly failed to adopt these sterling precepts in our daily lives.
 
One particular place in the Holy Quran where moral and ethical precepts have been grouped together beautifully is Surah Isra/Bani Israel, the Holy Book’s 17th surah. It would not be an exaggeration to say that if we were to follow these moral principles, a sea change could be witnessed in our personal and public lives.
Ayat 23 exhorts us to honour our parents and take care of them in their old age. While Pakistan remains a traditional, conservative society where the joint family system is still in vogue, we must ask ourselves if the instructions in this blessed verse are being acted upon. Indeed, the truth is the opposite, as we are seeing fissures within the family system. Therefore, respect for parents, as well as compassion and understanding from elders for youngsters, is essential to rebuild the family structure.
In ayat 26 mankind is instructed to respect the rights of relatives as well as to help the poor. Maintaining the bonds of kinship ties up with the earlier ayat, where strengthening the extended family structure is concerned. As far as philanthropy goes, Pakistanis do indeed give a lot to the deserving as can be witnessed even in these times of rapid inflation and economic insecurity.
However, instead of just ensuring the less fortunate are fed, they should be helped to stand on their feet, without hurting their dignity. Charity should be channelled into education and job training programmes to help others become self-sufficient.
The next ayat condemns wastefulness. Here a lot of work can be done in society. For example, anyone who has attended a Pakistani wedding can testify to the fact that even many normal people turn into gluttons at marriage ceremonies, piling food high on their plates, and then wasting much of it. These wasteful practices need to be curbed and we can start early, teaching kids that wasting food is hugely unfair to others, and is also a burden on the environment.
 
At other points in this surah believers are told to maintain fiscal probity, ie not to be miserly, and not to be spendthrifts either; not to kill; to protect the wealth of orphans; to be fair while weighing goods, and not to walk on the earth arrogantly.
Indeed, all these are practical teachings manifested in the magnetic personality of the Holy Prophet, whom the Holy Book also terms a “Lamp of guidance” (Sirajum Munira, Surah Ahzab). Hence, those looking to follow in his footsteps need to ponder the teachings mentioned.
If we wish to reform society, instead of setting up au­­thorities cha­n­­­ge must be­­gin with the self. We must ask ourselves: am I guilty of arrogance, de­­­ceitfulness, wastefulness etc? Unfor­tu­nately, in our society serm­onising and outward display of religi­ous pra­­ctices prevail, while few talk about fixing our moral and ethical def­ects. It should be remembered that in ahadith literature, jihad against the nafs (base self) has been called the “greatest jihad”.
Therefore, to truly follow the teachings of Rehmatul-lil-Alameen, those who wield power must shun arrogance and ostentation in favour of simplicity and moral transparency. It can be argued that as per the Quranic worldview, no society can be reformed until its elite shun corruption and crooked behaviour. This is another point for the rulers to ponder.
 
The Holy Prophet was the ruler of a nascent state, yet he lived like ordinary people and sought no special privileges for himself or his family members, other than love for his “close ones” as ajr (reward) for his labours.
Here, from the spirit of the Quran, two things appear abundantly clear: that the Noble Messenger was not interested in any worldly rewards, and that love for his “close ones” has been commanded by the Almighty.
In conclusion, devotion must be coupled with examination and purification of the self in order to truly follow in the footsteps of Rehmatul-lil-Alameen.",Newspaper

“My message at the ACC was that we should not forget this philosophy and I am optimistic there will be better outcomes in future.”
Speaking about Aisa Cup 2023, Raja announced that the tournament, a 50-over competition, would be held in Pakistan in September.
“The ACC has agreed and approved that the 2023 event in Pakistan will be a 50-over competition and held in September. This aligns very nicely with the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2023, which will be held in October and November,"" the PCB Digital quoted him as saying.
He added, “we are looking forward to hosting this tournament in Pakistan and I am confident it will be a well-organised event because this is what the fans want.""

""[It] will be a prelude to the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2022 to be held in Australia from 16 October to 13 November,” he said.",Sport
"Eight embrace martyrdom as terrorist attacks rise in KP
","October 28, 2021","PESHAWAR: Eight security personnel including four soldiers were martyred and another wounded in cross-border attack, ambush and bomb explosions in different areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in two days.  
Terrorists from inside Afghanistan attempted to cross the fence along the Pak-Afghan border in Kurram tribal district between the night of Tuesday and Wednesday when troops in a prompt response engaged them and thwarted their attempt, according to the military’s media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).  
During intense exchange of fire, however, Lance Naik Asad Ali, 24, resident of Kurram, and Sepoy Asif, 21, resident of Lakki Marwat, embraced martyrdom, the ISPR added.  
From Lakki Marwat, our correspondent adds: Four police constables were martyred when terrorists ambushed a patrolling party on a busy road linking Lakki Marwat with Mianwali on Tuesday night.

"Banks disburse mere Rs18bn low-cost housing loans
","October 28, 2021","KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Wednesday reported that banks’ lending for low-cost housing in the country was extremely poor, with disbursements reaching barely Rs18 billion against loan applications seeking Rs200bn. 
In a statement issued on Wednesday, SBP Governor Dr Reza Baqir appreciated the progress made by the banking industry in supporting low-cost housing finance but stressed the need to accelerate the pace of approvals by banks to match the requests for financing to ensure that people are not discouraged by the processing time. 
As per the latest numbers of October 18, banks have received applications of more than Rs200bn. The banks have approved financing of Rs78bn out of which Rs18bn has already been disbursed. 
Banks remained extreme­­ly cautious while lending for housing and construction despite support from the government and encouragement from the SBP.  
The SBP governor expressed the hope that with the combined efforts of all stakeholders, the dream of Pakistanis to have their own homes can become a reality.  
While appreciating the efforts, Mr Baqir also asked stakeholders to increase outreach of the Govern­ment’s Markup Subsidy Scheme for Housing Finance commonly known as Mera Pakistan Mera Ghar (MPMG) to the wider public. 
He said that when the journey of MPMG started last year, low-cost housing finance was almost non-existent as commercial banks rarely ventured in this area fearing its inherent risks.  
He said the housing and construction credit of banks has reached to Rs305 billion at the end of September 2021, which was Rs166bn at the end of September last year, showing an increase of Rs139bn and a year-on-year growth of 84pc. 
In July 2020, State Bank of Pakistan advised commercial banks to increase their lending for housing and construction sectors to at least 5pc of their private domestic sector advances by December 2021. To assist in this, the SBP advised quarterly target to each bank after individual consultation, leading to concerted effort.  
The focus on this segment increased and for the quarter ending Sept 30, 2021, banks had achieved 94pc of their assigned targets on a consolidated basis. During July-September 2021, banks increased their credit to housing and construction sector by Rs48bn from Rs257bn as of June 30, 2021.  
The banks have also established a joint call center to address queries of general public regarding MPMG which was recently inaugurated by the SBP governor. General public can reach the call center at 0-33-77-786-786. This call center will help resolve complaints and assist common persons who would like to borrow under MPMG but face difficulties in completing the requirements of banks.",Newspaper

","October 28, 2021","KABUL: Officials from Turkmenistan will visit Kabul this week to discuss continuing work on the TAPI pipeline linking the energy-rich Central Asian country through Afghanistan to Pakistan and India, the Taliban government said on Wednesday.
The pipeline is expected to carry 33 billion cubic meters (bcm) of natural gas each year along a route stretching 1,800 km (1,125 miles) from Galkynysh, the world’s second-biggest gas field, to the Indian city of Fazilka near the Pakistan border.

"Supreme Court irked by delay in vacating Hindu Gymkhana in Karachi
","October 28, 2021","KARACHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday expressed concern over an inordinate delay in getting vacated the heritage building of Hindu Gymkhana that currently houses the National Academy of Performing Arts (Napa) and not providing an alternative land to the academy. 
The court directed the authorities concerned to submit a report till Oct 29 (tomorrow).
A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Gulzar Ahmed said that the apex court had been issuing directives to authorities for the past three years to get the building vacated and grant substitute land to Napa, but the officials were shifting responsibility to each others.
The provincial culture secretary appeared in court and submitted that he took charge a week ago and his predecessor had sent the matter about alternative land to commissioner Karachi. The bench directed officials to file a report about alternative land to Napa on Friday.
A petition was filed by Shree Ratneshwar Mahadev Welfare in 2014 submitting that the heritage site belonged to the Hindu community of Karachi before partition as the gymkhana building was established for the promotion of social and religious activities of Hindus, but the government took it over as an evacuee trust property after partition. 
The petitioner argued that a directive may be issued to Napa to vacate the building and hand it over to the Hindu community.
Meanwhile, the bench directed the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation to remove encroachments around a nullah in PECHS after the KMC argued that society had built shops on a drain.
However, the lawyer for the society submitted that they had not made any construction on the nullah land.",Pakistan
"Opposition accuses PPP govt of allowing Nasla Tower construction
","October 28, 2021","KARACHI: As the Supreme Court ordered the demolition of Nasla Tower within a week, the support for the residents of the 15-storey building started growing as on Wednesday leaders of major political parties met the families sitting outside the building, expressed their sympathy and demanded that the Sindh government provide alternative residence before execution of the apex court orders.
First it was Leader of the Opposition in the Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh, who visited the families of the Nasla Towers and “appealed” to the Supreme Court to allow more time for resettlement of the residents on humanitarian grounds and devising a mechanism for payment of compensation to them at the earliest. 
While calling the apex court verdict “a tough one”, he assured the families that he would take up the issue with the federal government to find a way out within the ambit of the law on humanitarian grounds.
“Everyone knows that actually it’s the Sindh government of the Pakistan Peoples Party which is responsible for the construction of Nasla Tower,” he told reporters. “All the relevant department and agencies which allowed the construction of this project work under the Sindh government. Now it is the responsibility of the chief minister to ensure alternative residents for the affected families and timely disbursement of the compensation.”
Earlier, the parliamentary party leader of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) Kanwar Naveed Jameel approached the Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah asking him to take personal efforts and interest to ensure alternative residences to the affected families of Nasla Tower and reasonable compensation for each apartment owner in the building.
“One cannot deny the fact that the organisations which regulate the construction activities in the city and keep checks on illegal business related with the real estate sector work under the [control of] Sindh government in line with the defined law,” he stated in the letter. 
“The Sindh government is solely responsible for such illegal business and being the head of the government it’s now your responsibility to ensure reasonable alternative residence to the affected families,” he told the CM in the letter.
Only on Tuesday, MQM-P senior deputy convener Amir Khan met with the families at Nasla Tower and expressed solidarity with them. He told reporters that the officials of departments under the Sindh government who passed the layout plans and allowed the construction of the building should be held accountable.
Pak Sarzameen Party (PSP) chairman and former city mayor Syed Mustafa Kamal also met the Nasla Tower families on Wednesday and strongly condemned the Sindh government for promoting illegal construction activities which had ultimately led to a “disaster” for scores of families.
“This Nasla Tower should not be turned into another Lal Msajid by pushing the oppressed against the wall,” he said. 
“The problem of the victims of the Nasla tower can be solved within 24 hours. If the government does not have money to compensate the victims, then there are thousands of builders who can easily generate funds and later on the amount can be compensated to the builder by adjusting the same in SBCA [Sindh Building Control Authority] challans,” he suggested.",Pakistan
"Punjab IGP says won’t bow to TLP’s violence
","October 28, 2021","LAHORE: Inspector General of Punjab Police (IGP) Rao Sardar Ali on Wednesday called the situation alarming, saying it was a matter of serious concern that the violent protesters of the banned Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan were armed with weapons and opened straight fire on police.
“The TLP is a proscribed organisation and its armed men fired straight shots at police besides carrying out violent attacks,” he said while addressing a press conference.
Consequently, four officials were martyred and 263 injured, he said, adding the same group had earlier martyred three personnel and injured 741 others in clashes in Lahore.
“A banned organisation is dictating the government to devise the country’s foreign policy as per its (TLP) wishes forgetting that it was the sole domain of state authorities,” the IGP said.
He said the TLP was also pressurising the government to make rules of its choice, which was highly condemnable.
“We will not bow down and let the proscribed organisation play havoc,” he said, adding the Punjab police would ensure writ of the state in the larger public and national interest.
Four police officials were killed and hundreds of others injured, many of them critically, after 
 once again broke out between the proscribed outfit and police at Sadhoke in Kamoke tehsil of Gujranwala district.
Thousands of charged workers of the proscribed organisation turned violent after the law enforcement agencies asked them not to march ahead towards Islamabad and abide by the law. However, the protesters attacked the law enforcers, emboldened by their leaders’ provocative speeches asking the activists not to stop.
The crowd split into small groups, and chased and attacked the police personnel, inflicting a major dent on the security plan.
The violence in Sadhoke and Muridke led to deaths and injuries to hundreds of policemen and TLP workers. Police fired teargas to disperse the violent protesters who pelted the force with stones in return. The situation was reported to be tense till this report was filed late on Wednesday.
Video clips showed that the TLP workers had scaled nearby buildings, shops and residences from where they hurled petrol bombs and stones at police. In some clips they were shown to have taken shelter alongside the GT Road to continue attacks on the law enforcers.
There were reports that the TLP managed to breach the main security point at Sadhoke and reached close to the Gujranwala border.
Following the violence, the Punjab police directed the Gujranwala and Gujrat police to reinforce security while monitoring the entire situation from a helicopter above the area.
Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid claimed that police personnel were 
 after the TLP men used weapons and fired shots at them.
Meanwhile, a TLP spokesperson claimed two of their workers had been killed and 41 injured in clashes with police on Wednesday.
However, the group’s claim could not be confirmed independently, while the police high-ups claimed the organisation’s social media team was circulating videos of its ‘killed’ workers by editing old pictures and footage recorded during its previous violent protests.
A source said the Sheikhupura regional police officer was commanding the force near Muridke where the district police officers of Kasur, Nankana Sahib and Sheikhupura were already present.
The Lahore capital city police officer was also leading a contingent of the force dispatched from the provincial capital in addition to the personnel deployed by the Sheikhupura district.
The source said over 300 TLP men attacked the Kasur police contingent that had taken position as the first tier of security in Muridke,and injured many of them. An assistant sub-inspector, Muhammad Akbar, was killed on the spot. The mob also forced the Kasur district police officer to retreat from his position along with his force.
They later snatched a prison van carrying dozens of police personnel and drove it to the centre of the group’s sit-in where they allegedly tortured the law enforcers with clubs. The personnel were later released.
The source said that during the day-long clashes, the protesters regrouped and repeatedly clashed with the law enforcers as well as torched and damaged several official vehicles.",Pakistan
"Theekshana returns as Sri Lanka look to test Australia with spin
","October 28, 2021"," 
Theekshana, 21, who missed the win against Bangladesh due to a side strain, made his international debut only last month but has quickly established himself as a much-feared mystery bowler, drawing comparisons with former Lankan spinner Ajantha Mendis. 
“Maheesh will be playing tomorrow, if everything goes well. We’ve rested him from training yesterday. He’s improved tremendously,” Arthur told reporters. 
Spin proved to be Australia’s undoing in the 4-1 series defeat by Bangladesh in August, with the tourists struggling on pitches not too dissimilar from the ones seen in the United Arab Emirates so far. 
“He [Theekshana] is a quality bowler. I think we’ve also got to — he’s a mystery bowler... tactically we do study our opposition. We obviously have studied Australia,” said Arthur. “We had a series not so long ago when I was with Pakistan here against them where we did use spin quite successfully. So hopefully that works. If you haven’t seen Maheesh, he certainly poses some questions.”   
“He has a couple of different balls that do make you quite hesitant if you can’t pick them.”   
Australia scraped past South Africa in their opener at the weekend, with a win for either side on Thursday likely to be crucial in the race for the semi-finals. 
Arthur added that his team did not have much to lose after coming out unscathed in the qualifiers and that they were confident of beating anyone on their day. 
“The players have been outstanding. And we just are improving. For us, it’s about our journey. It’s not a sprint... the qualifiers were tough. There was a lot of pressure on us there. Now the pressure is reversed,” he said. 
The coach was full of praise for Charith Asalanka, whose superb knock led the way against Bangladesh. 
“To see Charith’s development has been incredible. I remember him arriving in our bubble just before we went to England... and to see Charith’s journey from England to where he is now is a credit to himself,” Arthur added.  
Meanwhile Australia wicket-keeper Matthew Wade has backed skipper Aaron Finch and David Warner to hit top gear and help drive the team to a maiden Twenty20 World Cup title. 
Finch has almost 2,500 runs in T20 Internationals with a personal high of 172, the second best individual score ever made. However, he was out for a duck in Australia’s opening five-wicket win over South Africa at the weekend and has passed 50 just once in his last seven T20 innings. 
Warner, meanwhile, made 14 against the Proteas after coming into the tournament having been dropped by his IPL side, Sunrisers Hyderabad. 
“They’re terrific players. They’re just short of runs,” said Wade. “Guys that are world-class players for as long as they have been in this format are never out of form. They’re just short of runs at the moment.”  
Wade played a key role in the win against South Africa as he and Marcus Stoinis stood unbeaten in a tense finish. 
Chasing a modest 119 for victory, Australia were in trouble at 81-5 before Stoinis, who made 24, and left-handed Wade (15) put on an unbeaten stand of 40 to steer the team to victory. 
“It’s been spoken a lot about going into this tour about Davey [Warner] especially. We know he’ll come good,” said Wade. “I’ve played long enough with him now that he’s been under pressure plenty of times in his career, comes out, has a big score.”  
Warner, who celebrated his 35th birthday on Wednesday, said he feels like he is just a boundary away from a good innings. 
“I actually think people talking about my form is quite funny,” Warner said. “Against South Africa, I got my benchmark back with where I should be with my feet and everything. I feel like I’m in a good space, I’m hitting the ball well in the nets and couldn’t be any more ready to go. 
“I felt like I was one boundary away from having a good innings.”  
Warner has an imposing recent record against Sri Lanka with undefeated scores of 100, 60 and 57 when he last faced them on home soil in 2019.",Newspaper
"50,000 GB children involved in child labour: survey
","October 28, 2021","			
The new report estimates prevalence of 13.1 per cent child labour in GB, with one in seven children is working.
Many children work in hazardous conditions and are almost twice as likely to report mental health problems, according to ‘
'. This is the first such survey conducted in the country since 1996.
It is also the largest survey conducted in GB, with a representative sample of 7,032 households from all the 10 districts representing nearly 400,000 children between the ages of five to17, living across urban and rural areas of the region.
The survey, conducted in collaboration with Unicef, says that child labour prevalence is lower among children living in a household where the household head has migrated, compared to the children living in a household where the household head never migrated.
Children from poorer households are more likely to be in child labour compared to children from richer households by various measures. Average household income is higher for children, who are not in child labour.
“The GB government is sternly committed to protect basic rights of every child and to ensure access of every child to basic education, health, social and mental wellbeing and more as protected under the Constitution of Pakistan and UN Convention on Rights of the Child,” said GB Chief Minister Khalid Khursheed Khan while launching the survey in Gilgit on Wednesday.
The survey also highlights that almost 30 per cent of children aged five to 17 in GB do not attend school. Amongst those, who attend school, there is gender disparity with 88 per cent boys and 77 per cent girls.
“Every child has the right to be protected from harm, exploitation and abuse,” said Unicef representative in Pakistan Aida Girma.
“Children should be provided access to learning opportunities — as opposed to being forced to engage in exploitative economic activities — to live with dignity and reach their full potential. This target can only be achieved if no child is left behind, no matter how difficult and challenging the circumstances,” she said.
It is reported that 0.2 per cent of girls aged 10 to 13 and 7.4 per cent of girls aged 14 to 17 have married. Less than one in three children has a birth certificate, with the percentage being 1.3 points higher for boys than girls and higher for children in older age groups with a difference of 14.8 percentage points between children aged five to nine and children aged 14 to 17.
The children involved in child labour live on average in households with slightly fewer members compared to children not in child labour. Children in child labour are less likely to live with both parents, and more likely to have lost at least one parent.
More than a quarter of all households have at least one child in child labour. The child labour rate decreases with wealth of the household. Almost 40 per cent of households in the poorest wealth quintile have a child in child labour.
The percentage of households with at least one child in child labour is three times as high in rural areas compared to urban areas where the child labour rate is 10 per cent.
The households where the highest education completed by the household head is any grade of primary school are the most likely to have at least one child in child labour and the percentage of households with at least one child in child labour decreases with the level of education of the household head and is about 10 percentage points lower for households where the household head obtained higher education compared to the average of 26.7 per cent.
The survey recommends that since child labour is a complex issue, it is imperative to devise a coordinated policy response, focusing education, social protection, labour markets and legal standards and regulations.
It highlights that around 14.8 percent of students are neither in school nor working. These children are particularly vulnerable to becoming engaged in child labour. 
The survey suggests that it is important to understand why these children do not attend school, especially as schools in public sector are providing free of cost education in GB.",Pakistan
"Undeterred, thousands of TLP workers enter Gujranwala as protest continues for 2nd week
","October 28, 2021","The rally comprising thousands of workers of the proscribed Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) left Kamoke and entered Gujranwala city on Thursday afternoon, as life in the areas surrounding its route continued to remain disrupted.
Some 4,000 TLP workers travelled on Grand Truck Road in large trucks and buses along with their supplies, as stick-wielding activists of the group guarded the procession from all sides.
The rally was expected to bypass Gujranwala city and continue its journey towards Islamabad after crossing the Qila Chand bypass. However, the procession continued on a straight path and reached Sheranwala Bagh in Gujranwala's Old Town.
Soon after reaching the inner city, the TLP protesters set up camp on GT Road, blocking the thoroughfare from Sheranwala to Lorry Adda. Markets in the vicinity were also closed down to avoid any untoward situation.
The protesters said they would spend the night in Gujranwala before leaving for Islamabad via Wazirabad and Gujrat in the morning.
The TLP demonstrators have blocked the GT Road in Gujranwala district from both sides since Wednesday, causing hardships to the area residents in their commutes. From Kamoke tehsil to Jhelum, cellular services have been suspended for 24 hours.
Educational institutions along GT Road have also been closed because of the uncertain situation.
Meanwhile, Minister for Information and Broadcasting Fawad Chaudhry said that there would be no talks between the government and the banned group till they clear the roads and hand over those responsible for the deaths of police officials.
			
He called on ""patriotic Pakistanis"" to disassociate themselves from the protest, to return to their homes and not become a part of ""terrorism"" against the state.
Planning and Development Minister Asad Umar said that ""murdering Muslim representatives of the state, destroying public property in your own country and creating chaos all in the name of religion is no service to religion"".
""It is simply doing what the enemies of Pakistan and Muslims would want to see,"" he said.
			
Prime Minister Imran Khan has also 
 a meeting of the National Security Committee for tomorrow (Friday). According to the information minister, the meeting was summoned in light of the situation arising out of the ""illegal activities"" by the banned group.
 
Meanwhile, Rangers and police personnel took positions near the Chenab river and Wazirabad border. Security officials plan to stop the TLP activists near the Wazirabad-Chenab river area instead of Gujranwala city, police sources earlier said.
In Wazirabad, local authorities have dug up trenches near the Chenab bridge which were further deepened to block the TLP march.
			
At a high-level meeting held to review the security situation, Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar directed officials to ""take every step possible"" to establish peace in the province, according to a statement.
He said nobody could be allowed to disturb people's daily lives, stressing that ""the protection of people's lives and properties is the state's foremost responsibility.""
In view of the situation caused by the TLP rally, the Pakistan Railways announced that three trains between Lahore and Rawalpindi — Subak Kharam, Islamabad Express and Rawal Express — would remain suspended today for both inbound and outbound services.
The Peshawar-Quetta Jaffar Express will also be suspended for the Peshawar-Lahore leg today, while the Green Line will remain suspended between Lahore and Rawalpindi.
All other trains will function according to their schedule and route, a PR spokesperson said.
			
Meanwhile, PML-N president and opposition leader Shehbaz Sharif criticised the government's handling of the situation arising out of the TLP rally, saying ""federal ministers are giving contradictory statements on the prevailing situation.""
He quoted a minister as saying that Prime Minister Imran Khan ""was unaware of [the] 2020 agreement with TLP"". 
""There is a sheer chaos & lack of leadership & the government machinery is totally clueless. This is IK's way of governing Pakistan!!"" Shehbaz wrote. 
			
But Human Rights Minister Shireen Mazari denied his allegation, calling Shehbaz a ""confused soul"" and saying the person he had quoted was not a federal minister.
""There is absolutely no confusion in the govt led by the PM as the cabinet decision yesterday made abundantly clear the position on TLP. Seems massive confusion persists in your information!"" she wrote.
			
As security forces braced for more violence, one more policeman succumbed to injuries from 
 with the TLP, Punjab Chief Minister's Focal Person for Digital Media Azhar Mashwani said on Thursday.
The policeman, identified as Ghulam Rasool, was posted in the province's Kasur district.
""He was injured in #TLPTerrorism on 27th October and was under treatment in THQ Hospital Muridke,"" Mashwani said in a tweet.
			
""These so-called lovers [of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)] did not even spare someone whose name was Ghulam Rasool,"" he wrote.
The developments come a day after the government 
 to crush the TLP by all means and resolved that the army, Rangers and police would stop participants of its long march from entering the federal capital.
The decision was taken by the federal cabinet in its meeting presided over by Prime Minister Imran Khan following which Rangers were requisitioned in Punjab for 60 days to maintain law and order in the province.
The government categorically announced that it could not meet the TLP’s demand of closing down the French embassy in Pakistan and revealed that there was no French ambassador in the country.
“The cabinet has decided to treat TLP as a militant organisation and it will be crushed as other such groups have been eliminated. The Pakistani state has defeated major terrorist organisations such as Al Qaeda,” Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said at a post-cabinet meeting press conference.
The government's announcement had come after at least four police officials were 
 and another 263 wounded, many of them seriously, when violent activists of the TLP clashed with police near Muridke and Sadhuke on Wednesday.
The fierce clashes broke out after the TLP tried to resume its march on Islamabad to pressurise the government to accept its demands.
Punjab Inspector General of Police Rao Sardar said the charged mob of the proscribed organisation martyred four police officials and injured 263 others. 
While briefing the media, he said: “TLP activists were armed with automatic weapons and shot straight fire on the police,” The use of arms against the law-enforcement agencies by the banned outfit was a matter of serious concern, the IGP added.
On its part, the TLP claimed that two workers of the organisation had died in the clashes with police and 41 had been wounded.
A TLP spokesman said police had used excessive force against their peaceful rally. However, the group’s claim of deaths of its workers could not be confirmed independently.
Police said the TLP was trying to mislead the public by making false claims on social media and posting some video clips from the past.
In a statement on Thursday, the TLP Central Shura claimed that it was being held responsible for the deaths of three policemen but that they had died in a collision between a police van and a Mazda truck.
The statement also denied officials' statement that TLP workers had used weapons during the clashes, demanding proof of the same.

 win over New Zealand, making them well placed for the semi-finals.
“If India comes in the final, then it would be very good for the International Cricket Council, fans around the world and for world cricket,” he said on Thursday.
“That will bring the two countries closer. For me, it should be a win for love and defeat for hate.“
The head coach also declared that his team have “the mindset of champions” as they play Afghanistan in the Twenty20 World Cup in Dubai on Friday.
“We are playing with the mindset of world champions,” he added.
 
“The two wins have given us the confidence and belief to achieve that goal.” Saqlain replaced Misbahul Haq, who

"Indian PM Modi to meet Pope Francis for first time
","October 28, 2021","Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet Pope Francis in Rome for the first time this weekend when he visits for the G20 summit, officials said on Thursday, in what could be a thorny encounter.
Activists say that religious minorities in Hindu-majority India have faced increased levels of discrimination and violence since Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) 
 in 2014.
While Muslims, who make up around 14 per cent of the population, have borne the brunt, Christians, who account for just over two per cent, have also suffered a rise in reported violent attacks.
 
Under the pretext that Christians are seeking to forcibly convert Hindus, more than 300 violent incidents have been recorded this year, according to a report by a group of non-governmental organisations released this month.

"Flights, weddings cancelled as China tackles Covid cases
","October 30, 2021","BEIJING: Beijing officials on Friday told residents to postpone weddings and keep funeral ceremonies short, as disease controls across China were tightened just months before the Winter Olympics kicks off in the capital. 
The world’s most populous nation has reduced infection numbers to a trickle since its initial epidemic last spring thanks to a zero-tolerance approach of border closures, targeted lockdowns and long quarantine periods. 
But China is now grappling with flare-ups in a dozen regions linked to tourists, spurring officials to order millions to stay home, restrict inter-provincial travel and ramp up testing. 
Case numbers remain far lower than in most countries, with 48 new domestic infections on Friday bringing the tally to fewer than 250 in the past week. 
But authorities are not taking any chances, with tens of thousands of people in Beijing — which will host the Winter Olympics in February — under lockdown after a handful of cases were detected. 
Residents should “postpone weddings, keep funerals brief, don’t organise banquets, and reduce unnecessary gatherings”, deputy chief of the city’s disease control centre Pang Xinghuo said at a Friday press conference. 
Tourist spots will further limit capacity, while the newly opened Universal Studios resort will enter a “state of emergency epidemic prevention”, said Beijing’s deputy publicity chief Xu Hejian, without giving further details. 
Queues stretched down the roads outside Beijing’s medical centres as people sought to comply with newly enhanced Covid controls. 
Software developer Tu Anling, 24, said she needed a test before being allowed to board a train to Nanjing, a city 1,000 kilometres to the south. 
“I initially arranged to meet friends here (in Beijing), but the recent outbreak made many suddenly say they’re not coming,” she said. 
Many regions are demanding passengers show a negative test before entering, especially those from cities that have recently reported cases. Others said they needed tests to take academic or professional exams. 
About 6m people are under lockdown across China including around 4m in the northwestern city of Lanzhou and the Inner Mongolian county of Ejin, where around 35,000 people live.",Newspaper
"Effort under way to make growth sustainable: SBP chief
","October 30, 2021","KARACHI: State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Governor Dr Reza Baqir said on Friday the central bank is determined to “take any and all measures” to ensure that economic growth remains sustainable.
Addressing the Pakistan Banking Awards (PBA) 2021 ceremony, Dr Baqir said the country will announce the agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) “very soon” for the next review.
“We see the journey ahead in partnership with the IMF. It’s not just the money that the IMF gives. It’s also the fact that we have confidence in the direction of our policies. Therefore, we’re very happy that an independent international institution gives to the rest of the world... its assessment of the outlook,” he said.
In his 45-minute address to bank CEOs and senior management, Dr Baqir spoke at length about sustainable economic growth without mentioning belt-tightening or austerity that people generally expect under an IMF loan programme.
“Today, we have a very welcome challenge, the challenge of growth. It’s a challenge that we’ve been wanting to have. For the last two years, growth has been slowing. The fact that we’re expected to grow close to five per cent this year is a welcome challenge for us,” he said.
The SBP governor said the current growth phase is going to be sustainable because, unlike previous growth spurts, it’s supported by a market-based exchange rate system.
“One factor that’s supporting and ensuring that our growth will be sustainable is our market-based exchange rate system. Since its introduction in June 2019, it’s played a very helpful role of a shock absorber,” he said, noting that it’ll ensure that the current account deficit doesn’t grow too much.
He listed many SBP initiatives — like concessionary finance schemes for exporters, higher remittances and Roshan Digital Accounts — that’ll help increase the supply of foreign exchange in the market, thus reducing the pressure on the rupee.
“The market-based exchange rate system is going to ensure that our external position remains sustainable,” he said.  
Meanwhile, Habib Bank Ltd received the PBA award for the best bank. It also received the prize for the best bank for small and medium businesses.
The award for the best microfinance award went to Khushhali Microfinance Bank Ltd. National Bank of Pakistan was acknowledged as the best bank for agriculture. United Bank Ltd grabbed the award for the best digital banking.

"SC orders demolition of under-construction Tejori Heights
","October 30, 2021","KARACHI: After 15-storey Nasla Tower, the Supreme Court on Friday ordered demolition of an under-construction multi-storey building in Gulshan-i-Iqbal and gave the builder and authorities four weeks to implement its order.
The court directed the Karachi commissioner and builders to demolish Tejori Heights Tower after the counsel for builders could not establish the ownership of the land being used for the construction of the residential complex.
A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Gulzar Ahmed and comprising Justice Ijaz Ul Ahsan and Justice Qazi Mohammad Amin Ahmed also directed the builders to refund the amount to allotttees within three months.
It also asked the commissioner to ensure that the process of demolition and removal of debris was completed within the stipulated period.
On Thursday, the bench had observed that the construction on the land was illegal as documents produced in court were manipulated and could not prove the ownership of the builders on the subject land.
The court was about to pass an order when senior counsel Raza Rabbani, representing the builders, sought time to consult his clients. The CJP adjourned the matter for Friday and asked the counsel to get instructions from his clients whether they were going to demolish the building on their own or the court pass an order.
When the bench took up the matter on Friday, Mr Rabbani informed it that the builders agreed to demolish the structure by themselves and sought time to remove files of the allotttees from the site office for purpose of payment of compensation.
Earlier, the bench had put several questions to the counsel regarding the documents placed before it and to justify the title of the land, but he could not come up with a satisfactory reply.
During the proceedings, it was surfaced that the land allegedly purchased by the builders related to Survey No. 190 while the project was being built on a different land located in Survey No.188. The bench had observed that till the cancelation of the sale deed of Survey 190, allotment cannot be made in Survey No 188.
Justice Ahsan had said that there should have been a fresh sale deed for new/substitute property as title cannot be transferred by rectification of general power of attorney or sale agreement.
The lawyer for Pakistan Railways, Raja Qasit Nawaz, had argued that the land in question had been allotted to the railways for the Karachi Circular Railways (KCR) and an illegal construction was being made by the builders after preparing forged documents of the land.
The under-construction building is located near the abandoned Gilani railway station of the KCR in Block 13-D, Gulshan-i-Iqbal.
In December last year, the apex court had ordered immediate suspension of work on Tejori Heights Tower and barred the builders from creating a third-party interest after observing that on the basis of documents, prima facie there was no right of Tejori Heights on the land in question and directed the commissioner of Karachi to take over the construction site till further order.
The project is owned by the Karachi Town Builders and Developers and the proprietor of the company is Javed Iqbal Qureshi, who is father-in-law of politician and businessman Kamran Tessori.
The PR had last year lodged an FIR against Tessori for allegedly encroaching upon railways land measuring 2,783 square yards.
The same bench directed the National Academy of Performing Arts (Napa) and authorities concerned to remove the marquees and other temporary structures within the premises of Hindu Gymkhana in two months as the same were affecting the heritage character of the building.
It also directed the culture secretary and Karachi commissioner to provide alternative accommodation to Napa, housing in the heritage building of Hindu Gymkhana.
After examining the pictures of the gymkhana, the bench noted that some of its windows at ground floor were of aluminium while the first floor of the building had wooden windows of old style and ruled that original character of the windows should be restored.
The bench also took exception to the construction of an auditorium by Napa and said that how such construction could be made on the premises of a heritage site.
The lawyer for Napa submitted that the auditorium was built behind heritage building for its activities without blocking the view, its arch and façade.
The counsel further argued that the Hindu Gymkhana premises had been given to Napa on 30-year rent lease following an agreement with the provincial culture department and litigations were pending before the Sindh High Court about an eviction notice and alleged changes affected to the building and construction.
After viewing the pictures lawyer for Napa had annexed with his pleadings the apex court observed that it did not provide a clear view of the building from all sides.
It issued directives to take pictures and make videos providing clear view of the gymkhana building and structures raised around it and present the same at the next hearing.
About relocation of Napa, the culture secretary proposed the Jinnah Cultural Complex, located in North Karachi, but counsel for Napa submitted that he was not aware of any such complex and could made a final decision after visiting it.
The bench observed that Napa should be relocated to such a place which was easily accessible and had enough space with a world class auditorium and related facilities and directed the commissioner to look for space and come up with proposals.
A petition was filed by Shree Ratneshwar Mahadev Welfare in 2014 stating that the heritage site belonged to the Hindu community of Karachi before partition as the gymkhana building was established for the promotion of social and religious activities of Hindus, but the government took it over as an evacuee trust property after partition. Therefore, the petitioner argued that directive may be issued to Napa to vacate the building and hand it over to the Hindu community.
The CJP also came down hard on secretary culture department over depilated conditions of heritage buildings of the province and asked him that what his department was doing to protect and preserve such sites.
He remarked that there were countless buildings with pre-colonial and colonial era and instead of preserving the heritage sites, such buildings were being demolished and replaced with high-rising structures.",Pakistan
"Sindh govt announces door-to-door Covid vaccination drive
","October 30, 2021","KARACHI: Sindh Chief Secretary Syed Mumtaz Ali Shah has directed all the deputy commissioners and district health officers (DHOs) to launch a two-week Covid-19 vaccination outreach drive in their respective districts ‘on a pattern similar to the polio campaign’.
In this respect, the officials have been told that they can engage the workforce of other programmes and departments if required.
The decision followed a review meeting of the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) with the provincial governments wherein members expressed “grave concern” over the substantial decline in the Covid-19 vaccination drive in Sindh and the failure of districts in meeting their targets.
“In this connection, all the deputy commissioners are required to coordinate with their counterpart DHOs and engage all polio teams, lady and community health workers and other outreach workers for the Covid-19 vaccination campaign.
The services of EPI (Expanded Programme for Immunisation) vaccinators and PPHI (People’s Primary Healthcare Initiative) workers may also be available,” according to a home department letter dated Oct 26.
It also suggests to deputy commissioners that they can engage Accelerated Action Plan staff of the population welfare department for this purpose.
“If the deputy commissioners feel, they may also request the emergency operation centre (EOC) coordinator of the health department, Sindh, to constitute extra mobile vaccination teams by availing the logistic support of philanthropic organisations like Edhi, Chippa, Hilal-i-Ahmer etc.
“The daily report may be shared with the EOC coordinator and deputy secretary (staff) to chief secretary, Sindh,” it said.
The deputy commissioners would also depute their subordinates with mobile vaccination teams with strict directives to check public transports, restaurants and public places and immunise those who are not vaccinated against Covid-19.
The two-week drive was supposed to begin from Oct 27, but sources in the health department said the campaign was yet to take off.
The chief secretary was recently briefed in a meeting that 40 per cent people (13.759 million) in Sindh had received their first dose of Covid-19 vaccination whereas 24pc population (8.210m) had completed the two-dose vaccination course.
About the vaccination drive in educational institutions, the meeting was informed that 65,000 college students had also received Covid-19 vaccine shots.
In his remarks, the chief secretary gave directives to make it binding on private educational institutions to ensure vaccination of all their teaching and non-teaching staff and students.",Pakistan
"PPP activists take to the streets in twin cities against inflation
","October 30, 2021","ISLAMABAD: PPP activists in Islamabad and Rawalpindi staged protests on Friday against price hike, increase in poverty and unemployment.
The party organised the protests after Friday prayers on the call of PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.
In Islamabad, the demonstration was held in E-11 where workers and activists carried party flags, and chanted slogans against the government and in favour of Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Asif Ali Zardari.
Addressing the gathering, PPP General Secretary Syed Nayyar Hussain Bukhari said Imran Khan’s energy minister claimed that Pakistan was comparatively a cheap country in the region. 
“For him there is no inflation because he does not spend a single penny from his own pocket because petrol, electricity and gas are free for him and he is making fun of the poor,” he said.
“In 38 months, the people’s miseries have multiplied and they hardly make ends meet,” he said.
He urged the people to join the opposition to overthrow Imran Khan’s government as it was responsible for the price hike and problems being faced by them.
He said the finance minister said there would be more inflation but we inform him that the days of PTI government are numbered and people could not see the incompetent government to stay in power.
“It is time to say goodbye to these rulers. Bilawal is protesting against inflation as he is the heir of Benazir Bhutto who worked hard for the poor,” he said.
Terming Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed’s statements on Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan non-serious, the PPP leader said the minister changed his statement on the third day and his party every day. 
“Why did you make an agreement that could not be implemented,” he said.
In Rawalpindi, PPP staged protest on I.J. Principal Road.

"Asif the Finisher flattens Afghanistan
","October 30, 2021","SHADAB Khan wanted a single. Asif Ali didn’t. Asif wanted the strike. He wanted to do what Asif Ali does, and loft the ball effortlessly over the boundary. So, Asif sent Shadab back when Shadab had almost run to his end. It was a big call, but Asif the Finisher is playing the cricket of his life. People thought Asif wanted the short legside boundary. But the boundary didn’t matter to Asif, he just wanted the strike. The next over went six, dot, six, dot, six, six, and the match was over. The first six flew over long off and covered 92m. 
Pakistan had 
 Afghanistan to place one foot firmly in the World T20 semi-finals. It was a brave effort from Afghanistan in a match heavy on passion, both from the crowd and the players. Hearts often ruled heads, and the game was the more enjoyable for it.
If the passion of the two teams was equally matched, Afghanistan’s desperation seemed greater as they over-attacked their way to 76 for 6 in the 13th over. After that Afghanistan clawed their way back to set Pakistan a respectable total. Then, with three overs to go in Pakistan’s faltering run chase, Afghanistan even seemed the more likely winners — until Asif came to the party.
Asif has batted for only 19 balls in this tournament. In that time he has scored 52 runs and hit 7 sixes and a four. He is yet to get out. He has scored those runs under immense pressure, but looked in firm control of himself and the match situation. He is a short batsman who gets under the ball so expertly and with such power, whether short or full, that once a ball is hit the only destination is out of the ground.
 
Pakistan’s T20 formula relies on runs at the top order from the dynamic duo of Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan. What follows is generally suspect. A finisher is something other teams have. A consistent hitter is something other teams have. In two high-profile run chases, Asif has perfected the art of the hitter finisher. If nobody outside Pakistan had heard of Asif Ali before this World T20, they all know him now, Asif the Finisher with ice in his veins.
With Rizwan’s early dismissal, the question was who would pick up the baton and support Babar. Fakhar Zaman offered most promise, but he couldn’t see the job through, and neither could Mohammad Hafeez. Meanwhile, Babar rattled off one his least fluent fifties before atypically losing his patience, bowled off Rashid Khan’s last ball. It seemed a rash decision by Pakistan’s captain, as it left his team 26 to score off three overs. In the angst over Babar’s ill-timed exit, Asif slipped in almost silently, ready to do his night’s work.
The beginning of the match was wild. Pakistan’s fast bowlers sacrificed some control as they pushed for every inch of speed, responding to the roars of the crowd and their inner emotions. Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris Rauf were electric. Afghanistan were equal in their bravado, either nailing their big shots or miscuing into the hands of Pakistan’s fielders. 
It was this mayhem that left Afghanistan struggling. Pakistan’s domination was largely through their spinners. Imad Wasim and Shadab continued their excellent form on a pitch that favoured spin, although Mohammad Hafeez was unused. 
The innings got away from Pakistan in a late burst from Mohammad Nabi and Gulbadin Naib. Pakistan didn’t bowl badly but they were not quite the impeccable bowling force that we saw against India and Pakistan, but the mad noise of Dubai’s cricket stadium was enough to wobble anybody’s nerves. And those wobbles were enough to see Pakistan’s bowlers betray their iron discipline in line of attack just enough to allow Afghanistan a competitive total.
Pakistan are top of the table with one foot and half in the semi-finals. The challenge for Babar Azam’s team is to retain their intensity and avoid complacency. The last time Pakistan looked so strong so early in a world tournament was the 1999 World Cup in England. Their interim coach, Saqlain Mushtaq, was a central part of the highs, lows, and emotions of that journey. For Pakistan, the highs and the passion often go hand in hand, and Saqlain’s job is to keep the lows at bay. 
With the revival of Pakistan’s spin bowling and the discovery of Asif Ali, the Finisher, the prospect of lifting a second World T20 trophy grows more realistic with each game.",Newspaper

"Senate body rejects bill declaring women’s inheritance fundamental right
","November 4, 2021","ISLAMABAD: The Senate Standing Committee on Law and Justice on Wednesday rejected two constitution amendment bills, including the one seeking to declare women’s inheritance a fundamental right, with a majority vote.
The committee, however, approved two other constitution amendment bills, including the one seeking to authorise advisers to the chief ministers to participate in the proceedings of the provincial assemblies.
The committee which met under Syed Ali Zafar of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), was to take up a heavy legislative agenda that included 11 private member’s constitution amendment bills, but it had to defer most of them due to the absence of the movers.
Through the bills, mostly tabled by the opposition members, the movers had suggested some crucial changes to various provisions of the Constitution related to the promulgation of ordinance, increase in the powers of the Senate, ensuring meaningful participation of the provinces in the affairs of the federation and fundamental rights of the citizens of Pakistan.
The committee members were found divided in their opinion while discussing the bill moved by Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Senator Saadia Abbasi seeking to include the right of inheritance for women as the fundamental right under the Constitution.
Through the bill, Ms Abbasi had suggested insertion of a new Article 24A in the Constitution and the proposed amendment read “no women shall be deprived of her share from the inheritance in Pakistan”.
While arguing in favour of her bill, Ms Abbasi said Islam had prescribed well-defined shares for the male and female descendants of a deceased person, according to an official handout issued by the Senate Secretariat.
She said Islamic law entitled women to inherit immovable and movable properties, yet the practice had been to deny women their share in inheritance. She termed it an unjustified practice that had become a norm.
She said the purpose of her bill was to acknowledge, declare and assert the right of women in inheritance as a fundamental right in consonance with principles of Islam. She further said if the said amendment was approved it would enable women to directly approach the Supreme Court on matters related to inheritance.
Railways Minister Azam Swati was of the view that relevant laws already existed and there was no need for listing the matter of inheritance as fundamental right.
On the other hand, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Senator Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, while supporting the bill, said this amendment reinforced the state’s commitment towards protecting women’s right to inheritance.
However, another PPP senator and former law minister Farooq Naek also endorsed the minister’s viewpoint, saying they needed to work towards better implementation of the existing laws. Later, the chairman put the bill before the members for a vote and it was rejected with a majority.
The committee rejected another constitution amendment bill, also introduced by Ms Abbasi, regarding citizens’ right to bail and also declaring it a fundamental right in the Constitution.
The committee, however, approved the bill moved by Ms Abbasi regarding identification, preservation, conservation, restoration and access for all to national heritage sites of Pakistan.",Pakistan
"US watchdog finds no misconduct in mistaken Afghan airstrike that killed 10
","November 4, 2021","An independent Pentagon review has concluded that the 
 that killed innocent Kabul civilians and children in the final days of the Afghanistan war was not caused by misconduct or negligence, and it doesn’t recommend any disciplinary action.
The review, done by US Air Force Lt Gen Sami Said, found there were breakdowns in communication and in the process of identifying and confirming the target of the bombing. Said concluded that the mistaken strike happened despite prudent measures to prevent civilian deaths.
“I found that given the information they had and the analysis that they did — I understand they reached the wrong conclusion, but ... was it reasonable to conclude what they concluded based on what they had? It was not unreasonable. It just turned out to be incorrect,” Said said. He is the inspector general of the US Air Force and is considered independent as he had no direct connection to Afghanistan operations.
His review said the drone strike must be considered in the context of the moment, as US forces under stress were being flooded by information about threats to troops and civilians at the Kabul airport, just days after a 
. Thousands of Afghans were swarming the airport, trying to get out of the country following the Taliban takeover.
Said found that better communication between those making the strike decision and other support personnel might have raised more doubts about the bombing, but in the end, may not have prevented it.
Said was asked to investigate the August 29 drone strike on a white Toyota Corolla sedan, which killed Zemerai Ahmadi and 
, including seven children. Ahmadi, 37, was a longtime employee of an American humanitarian organisation.
The intelligence about the car and its potential threat came just days after a suicide bomber of the militant Islamic State group killed 13 US troops and 169 Afghans at a Kabul airport gate. The US was working to evacuate thousands of Americans, Afghans and other allies in the wake of the collapse of the country’s government.
Said concluded that US forces genuinely believed that the car they were following was an imminent threat and that they needed to strike it before it got closer to the airport.
“They all have a genuine belief based on the information they had and the interpretation, that that was a threat to US forces, an imminent threat to US forces,” he told reporters during a Pentagon briefing. “That’s a mistake. It’s a regrettable mistake. It’s an honest mistake. I understand the consequences, but it’s not criminal conduct, random conduct, negligence.”
He said repeated reviews of the video from that day showed that two minutes before the strike was launched, there was evidence that a child was in the strike zone.
Said, who said he watched the video himself, said troops in the strike cell did not see the child.
“I’m just saying it is 100 per cent not obvious,” he said. “You have to be like, no kidding, looking for it. But when you’re looking for it, certainly after the fact, if you ask me, was there evidence of the presence? Yes, there was.”
Steven Kwon, president of Nutrition and Education International, which employed Ahmadi, said he was deeply disappointed in the review.
“According to the inspector general, there was a mistake but no one acted wrongly, and I’m left wondering, how can that be?” Kwon said in a statement. “Clearly, good military intentions are not enough when the outcome is 10 precious Afghan civilian lives lost and reputations ruined.”
The report, which has been endorsed by Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, made several recommendations that have been passed on to commanders at US Central Command and US Special Operations Command. The review recommends that more be done to prevent what military officials call “confirmation bias” — the idea that troops making the strike decision were too quick to conclude that what they were seeing aligned with the intelligence and confirmed their conclusion to bomb what turned out to be the wrong car.
Specifically, the review said the military should have personnel present with a strike team, and their job should be to actively question such conclusions. The report says using a so-called “red-team” in such self-defence strikes that are being done quickly might help avoid errors.
Said also recommended that the military improve its procedures to ensure that children and other innocent civilians are not present before launching a time-sensitive strike.
Those changes, he said, could “go a long way to greatly mitigate the risk of this happening again” in these types of rapidly moving, self-defence strikes.
For days after the strike, Pentagon officials asserted that it had been conducted correctly, despite 
 that multiple civilians and children had died and growing doubts that the car contained explosives. Said’s review concluded that officials made their initial assessments too quickly and did not do enough analysis.
While Said’s report does not find individual fault or recommend discipline, he said commanders may decide to take administrative actions once they review his report. He said commanders may look at the report and determine that there was “subpar performance” and decide to decredential, retrain or fire personnel.
“You should not perceive the fact that I didn’t call any individual out with accountability that it does not mean that the chain of command won’t,” he said.
The US is working to 
 to the family, and potentially get them out of Afghanistan, but nothing has been finalised.
A second defence official said Austin has asked that Gen Frank McKenzie, head of US Central Command, and Gen Richard Clarke, head of US Special Operations Command, come back to him with recommendations for changes to address the gaps.
Said’s review mirrors many of the findings outlined by McKenzie several weeks after the investigation.
The Central Command review found that US forces tracked the car for about eight hours and launched the strike in an “earnest belief” — based on a standard of “reasonable certainty” — that it posed an imminent threat to American troops at Kabul airport. The car was believed to have been carrying explosives in its trunk.
The airstrike was the last in a US war that ended just days later, as the final American troops flew out of Kabul airport, leaving the Taliban in power.",World

"Yorkshire suspended from hosting matches over handling of racism allegations by Pakistan-born player
","November 4, 2021","England's Yorkshire County Cricket Club (YCCC) have been suspended from hosting international or major matches over their handling of allegations of racism by Pakistan-born former player Azeem Rafiq, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said on Thursday.
“It is clear ... that YCCC's handling of the issues raised by Azeem Rafiq is wholly unacceptable and is causing serious damage to the reputation of the game,” the ECB said in a statement.
“The ECB find this matter abhorrent and against the spirit of cricket and its values.” 
Yorkshire batsman Gary Ballance, who said on Wednesday that he had used racist language towards his former teammate Rafiq, has also been indefinitely suspended from England selection.
“Before any regulatory investigation is complete, the Board wishes to take immediate action in relation to Gary Ballance,” the ECB said.
“While Ballance has not been selected to play for England since 2017, he will be suspended indefinitely from selection. This position will be reviewed following the ECB regulatory investigation into his conduct.” 
The ECB added that it had agreed to hold Yorkshire to account over their handling of the matter and to consider sanctions including, but not limited to financial and future match allocations at the end of its investigation.
“In the meantime, YCCC are suspended from hosting international or major matches until it has clearly demonstrated that it can meet the standards expected of an international venue, ECB member and First Class County,” the ECB said.
The club's Headingley stadium is used regularly for England's test and limited overs matches and is due to stage a Test between England and New Zealand in June 2022, as well as a One-Day International featuring South Africa in July.
Several sponsors have ended their partnerships with Yorkshire following an independent report into allegations of racism made by Rafiq.
Earlier, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson stepped up the pressure on the ECB on the matter as his spokesperson told reporters: “The PM's clear that racist language should never be used in any context whatsoever. These are serious allegations. They must be investigated thoroughly and quickly. We urge the ECB to look at this carefully.""
Rafiq, Yorkshire's chairperson and the county's chief executive and director of cricket have all been summoned to testify before a parliamentary committee on November 16.
Meanwhile, Rafiq has demanded sweeping changes at his former English county club and across the sport and has revealed he is still suffering abuse amid a deepening racism row.
Yorkshire offered the 30-year-old off-spinner 
 in a report on his allegations of racial abuse in September.
But last week, the county said it would take no disciplinary action against any staff, unleashing a wave of criticism and prompting sponsors to withdraw their support.
Rafiq said the row was about “institutional racism and abject failures by numerous leaders at Yorkshire County Cricket Club and in the wider game"".
“The sport I love and my club desperately need reform and cultural change,” he posted on Twitter. 
			
“The system and environment changes that will organically educate and bring through a new generation that make this the beautiful game it should be,” he added. 
			
Former England international Gary Ballance on Wednesday admitted using a racial slur against Rafiq during their time together at Yorkshire, saying in a statement: “I regret that I used this word in immature exchanges in my younger years.""
“I do not wish to discredit Rafa by repeating the words and statements that he made about me and others but I have to be clear that this was a situation where best friends said offensive things to each other which, outside of that context, would be considered wholly inappropriate,” Ballance said, adding that “at no time did I believe or understand that it had caused Rafa distress”. He said that if he had realised, “then I would have stopped immediately”.
However, Rafiq on Thursday said that despite the condemnation of his treatment at Yorkshire, criticism is still coming his way.
“We wonder why people don't come forward. Even after everything that is out there, there seem to be personal attacks coming. What a sad state of affairs,” he said.
Ballance's admission came after publishing company Emerald ended their association with Yorkshire and their Headingley ground in Leeds over the handling of the report that found Rafiq suffered “racial harassment and bullying” at the club, with other club sponsors following suit.
Rafiq, who represented Yorkshire in two spells between 2008 and 2018, made 43 
 and said he had been driven to suicidal thoughts by his treatment at the club.
Yorkshire's redacted report upheld seven of his claims but concluded the club was not institutionally racist.",Sport
"Tehran’s envoy wants promotion of Pak-Iran trade
","November 3, 2021","QUETTA: Consul General of Iran in Quetta Hassan Darwishvand has said that in order to promote trade and achieve trade targets, governments of Pakistan and Iran should take steps to resolve issues being faced by businessmen of the two countries.
Speaking at a meeting with a delegation of the Quetta Chamber of Commerce and Industry (QCCI) led by its President Fida Hussain Dashti on Tuesday, Mr Darwishvand said the issues would be discussed in the upcoming annual meeting of the Joint Border Trade Commission.
He said a meeting of the commission would be held soon in Zahidan in which steps would be suggested for strengthening bilateral trade and for resolving issues being faced by the businessmen of the two countries.
“In this regard, Iran is always ready for all possible cooperation,” said Iran’s envoy, adding that authorities concerned should be approached for resolving issues affecting smooth trade activities between the two countries.
The envoy suggested that the business communities of Pakistan and Iran should form committees for resolving visa and other issues.
He appreciated the role of the Quetta Chamber of Commerce and Industry in promoting Pak-Iran trade relations and held out an assurance that Iranian government would play its role in removing all obstacles for smooth trade activities between the two countries.

"Injured Messi out of Champions League clash with Leipzig
","November 3, 2021","LEIPZIG: Argentinian superstar Lionel Messi will miss Wednesday’s Champions League clash with RB Leipzig due to injury, Paris Saint Germain announced on Tuesday.
The 34-year-old six-time Ballon d’Or winner has a left hamstring problem and a painful knee.
Messi had gone off at half-time of PSG’s 2-1 Ligue 1 victory over Lille last Friday but coach Mauricio Pochettino had said he expected him to be fit for the Leizig match.
However, he missed training on Monday and on Tuesday the club confirmed he would not after all be fit.
PSG’s statement said the four-time Champions League winner was suffering from  “a pain in his hamstring in his left thigh and a painful knee due to bruising.”
Messi may also be a doubt for Saturday’s Ligue 1 clash between table-toppers PSG and strugglers Bordeaux. He is due to then join up with his national squad for two World Cup qualifiers against Uruguay and Brazil.
Wednesday’s game will be the third match that Messi has missed this season due to injury, having sat out two Ligue 1 matches at the end of September.
Messi has made a low-key start to his spell at the French giants since arriving from Barcelona in August.
However, he produced one of his better performances in the 3-2 win over Leipzig a fortnight ago in Paris, scoring a double including the winner from the penalty spot.
He said when he ended almost two decades at Barcelona a major reason for joining PSG was to win a fifth Champions League trophy.
PSG will also be missing influential midfielder Marco Verratti -- who has a hip injury -- but welcome back French World Cup winner Kylian Mbappe into the squad after missing the game with Lille.
PSG top their Champions League group after three matches with seven points.
Last season’s beaten finalists Manchester City are a point behind whilst Leipzig are yet to get off the mark after three defeats.
Atletico Madrid may have knocked  Liverpool out of the Champions League two seasons ago but coach Diego  Simeone is not expecting either side to have that game in mind when they  meet at Anfield in their Group B clash on Wednesday.
Simeone’s  side scored twice in extra time on Merseyside to seal a dramatic 4-2  aggregate win in that last-16 match against then European champions  Liverpool.
But, after losing 3-2 to Juergen Klopp’s men in Madrid  in their group game in mid-October, Atletico will be determined to take  something from the game as they sit second in the group on four points,  level with Porto but five adrift of Liverpool.
“I understand that  we are talking about two great teams with two great stadiums, its a big  game but there is no rematch in soccer,” Simeone told a news conference  on Tuesday.
“That Anfield game it’s in the past, we won and moved  on. Those things don’t go back. It will be a game that Atletico fans will  remember but wont be a factor in tomorrow’s game.”
Meanwhile, Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola said they are completely focused on  Wednesday’s Champions League group game against Club Brugge and will not  have the weekend’s Manchester derby in the Premier League on the back  of their minds.
Last season’s  finalists City are second in Group A, a point behind unbeaten Paris St  Germain at the halfway stage of the phase. City play neighbours United at Old Trafford on  Saturday.
Guardiola’s side sit five points behind league leaders  Chelsea but the Spaniard said, unlike the Champions League, they would  have plenty of games to catch up in the title race.
“This game is  much more important than the United game. It gives us an incredible step  forward to qualify for the last 16,” Guardiola told reporters on  Tuesday.
“In the Premier League there are many games, here just  six [in the group stage] -- now three left. The third and fourth games  are the most important games and we need to take it seriously.
“Tomorrow  we have a chance, every year is more difficult. It’s just six games,  lose more than one or two (and) it’s difficult. We already lost in  Paris.”
Also on Tuesday, AC Milan coach Stefano Pioli said he is  fully aware his side will get no more chances in the Champions League  this season, knowing only victory will do against Porto in the San Siro  on Wednesday.
Milan have put in some strong performances on their  return to the Champions League, but they have mattered little as Pioli’s  side are bottom of Group B without a point.
“We don’t have to think about other  matches, tomorrow is the final chance,” Pioli told a news conference on  Tuesday.  “We believe we can still do it [reach the last 16].
“We  have the qualities to stop this negative streak of results. We deserved  more points, it’s true, but we are on zero in the standings -- we have a  game to fix it.”
Turkish club Besiktas will be  on the hunt for their first Champions League win of the season as they  travel to Portugal for Wednesday’s clash with Sporting CP.",Newspaper
"Rabada-inspired South Africa rout Bangladesh to boost semis hopes
","November 3, 2021","ABU DHABI: Pace spearhead Kagiso Rabada stood out with figures of 3-20 to help South Africa boost their semi-final hopes at the Twenty20 World Cup with a six-wicket win over Bangladesh here at the Sheikh Zayed Cricket Stadium on Tuesday.
Rabada and fellow quick Anrich Nortje shared six wickets between them to skittle out Bangladesh for just 84 in 18.2 overs in Abu Dhabi.
South Africa lost four wickets but skipper Temba Bavuma hit an unbeaten 31 and steered the team home in 13.3 overs for the third win from four Super 12 matches.
Taskin Ahmed returned figures of 2-18 but Bangladesh bowed out of the race for the final four after losing all their four matches. Rabada came all guns blazing after South Africa elected to field first and sent back Mohammed Naim, for nine, and Soumya Sarkar, for nought, to be on a hat-trick.
Mushfiqur Rahim denied Rabada his third successive wicket on the first ball of his next over but got out three deliveries later without scoring.
Bangladesh suffered another double blow when Nortje claimed skipper Mahmudullah Riyad’s prized scalp for three and Afif Hossain fell to Dwaine Pretorius for a duck.
 
Bangladesh slipped to 34-5 and the wickets kept tumbling with Nortje and leg-spinner Tabraiz Shamsi sharing five wickets between them as South Africa wrapped up the Bangladesh innings in 18.2 overs.
Mahedi Hasan top-scored with 27 before being caught and bowled by Nortje.
In reply, South Africa fell to 33-3 after Aiden Markam was dismissed for nought by Taskin but Rassie van der Dussen, who made 22, and Bavuma put the chase back on track.
The pair put on 47 runs for the fourth wicket before Nasum Ahmed got van der Dussen out.
David Miller came to hit the winning boundary as South Africa made it three wins in a row after their opening loss to Australia who are third in the table led by unbeaten England.
England, with four wins from four, are virtually assured of a place in the semi-finals leaving South Africa and Australia as the main contenders for second place in the group.
Meanwhile, Kagiso hailed South Africa’s convincing win over Bangladesh.
“What we have shown is that we have had different individuals stand up in different games and I think that’s been the key,  we are performing as a team. Glad we convincingly won today,” said Rabada.
“If I can contribute to the team success I’ll take it, even if I am not taking wickets,” said Rabada.“But on a personal note, it’s good to take wickets especially up front in the powerplay making inroads, that’s what we strive to do.
“I  am chuffed, but I am certainly not going to think about cricket tomorrow until we have to train again, but when the time comes we will regroup and strategise for England [on Saturday]. And it is going to be a  good game,” the pacer added.
Mahmudullah expressed his disappointment at the results Bangladesh have produced so far in the event.
“It’s frustrating, but we could have won two games,” Mahmudullah said of his team’s losses including two close matches against Sri Lanka and  West Indies. “If we had won those games, it would have been a different story.”
Bangladesh and Sri  Lanka are now definitely out of the equation in Group 1 with West Indies  only left with a slim chance of progress.

"Palestinians reject offer to delay their Jerusalem eviction
","November 3, 2021","JERUSALEM: Palestinian families on Tuesday rejected an offer that would have delayed their eviction by Jewish settlers in a tense Jerusalem neighbourhood, where protests and clashes helped ignite the 11-day Gaza war in May.
The four families in the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood near the Old City said their decision springs from our belief in the justice of our cause and our right to our homes and our homeland. They said that rather than submit to an unjust agreement they would rely on the Palestinian street to raise international awareness of their plight.
The proposal floated by Israel’s Supreme Court last month would have made them protected tenants, blocking any eviction and demolition order for at least the next 15 years, according to Ir Amim, an Israeli rights group that closely follows developments in the city.
The families would have been able to continue arguing their case in Israeli courts. But it would have forced them to at least temporarily attest to the settlers’ ownership of the properties, which could weaken the families’ case going forward, and pay rent to the settlers.
The four families are among dozens in Jerusalem who are threatened with eviction by Jewish settler organisations in several cases that have been working their way through the Israeli court system for decades.
The settlers are making use of an Israeli law that allows them to claim properties that were owned by Jews prior to the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation. Palestinians who lost homes, properties and lands in the same conflict do not have the right to recover them.
There was no immediate comment from the settlers, but Jerusalem Deputy Mayor Arieh King, a staunch supporter, said they had accepted the offer.
The families, who are originally from what is now Israel, say the Jordanian government granted them the land on which their homes were later built in exchange for their refugee status after it assumed control of the West Bank and east Jerusalem in 1948. They have been living there ever since.
Israel has portrayed the matter as a private real-estate dispute, but the Palestinians and human rights groups view it as a coordinated attempt to push Palestinian residents out of Jerusalem and change the city’s identity.",Newspaper
"Robust prisons management system handed over to Sindh govt by UN institutions
","November 3, 2021","			
HYDERABAD: Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah has said that his government is comm­itted to transforming prisons into true reformatories and correctional facilities in order to make inmates useful members of society.
He was speaking at ceremony held here on Tuesday for the han­ding over of the Prisons Manag­ement Information System (PMIS) to the provincial government and inauguration of the Sindh Prisons Staff Training Institute.
He thanked the UN Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs and the UN Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC) for their support in establishing these facilities.
“Unfortunately, it’s failure of government, civil society and legislature that we have to have inmates in prisons. We need to make sure that when inmates come out of prisons, they become better persons and contribute to society positively. For this, we need to train our staff,” Mr Shah said.
He said Sindh government had replaced a century-old prison law in 2019 with a forward looking enactment. He hoped that the facility just put in place would go a long way in making sure that prisons staff implemented the new law. He noted that other provinces were looking for updating their prisons law. He specifically recalled how the authorities in 1999 had claimed to have forgotten an inmate when he came to seek his bail.
“The system won’t forget any inmate. Each and every prisoner will be counted. It will enable the chief minister to press a button to know how many inmates are in jail,” he said.
The CM said that Sindh used to be crime-free until late 70s and early 80s when a culture of Kalashnikov and drugs entered this province and people were faced with it over 40 years on.
He said prisons had become places where hardened criminals not only created problems for the staff but also produced more criminals by recruiting inmates with minor offences.
He pointed out that his gover­nment was establishing a security prison in Thatta to keep only hardened criminals. Inmates with minor offences would be kept in other jails, which would be made proper correctional facilities, he added.
Mr Shah also sought the UN institutions’ help in eliminating use of drugs from the province. “The Hyderabad division has a major problem. We need to do away with this menace as it is affecting our future generations,” he said.
US Consul General at Karachi Mark Stroh told the audience that his country valued its relations with Pakistan. US remained the largest contributor to Pakistan in civilian assistance, he said. “Our ties are deep, broad and longstanding,” he added.
He said that for 40 years, US worked together with Pakistan to improve security and law enfor­cement agencies’ capacity across Pakistan. Since 2002, the INL had been trying to build and improve their long-term sustainable exper­tise and operational and profes­sional capacity. “It’s aimed at stren­gthening rule of law and justice in Pakistan,” he said.
Mark Tervakoski, the director of the US embassy’s International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Section, said that 600 prison staff would be trained every year at the newly established institute.
The PMIS has been set up at 22 prisons in Sindh to keep a track of inmates, their security, visitations and record. It would streamline the system and make it more humane to have a lasting impact by training correctional staff and digitise inmates’ record and their cases.
He said through this project, US would bring Pakistan’s prisons practices in line with international standards and ultimately increase effect­iveness of the country’s crim­inal justice and correctional systems.
UNODC representative Jeremy Milsom said the system would rid the prison authorities of time consuming paper work. The robust PMIS would reduce administrative work and speedup responsiveness to inmates’ needs.",Pakistan
"Wazirabad police find body of constable ‘kidnapped, tortured by TLP protesters’
","November 3, 2021","GUJRAT: Wazirabad police have found the dead body of a policeman lying in a field near Wadala Cheema village who was allegedly kidnapped and tortured to death by the unidentified workers of the proscribed Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) on Sunday night when he was returning home after performing his duty.
Police said Constable Adnan Ahsan Butt, a resident of Wahdat Colony, Gujranwala, was kidnapped by some unidentified TLP workers and later tortured to death even after an 
 between the government and the proscribed party last Sunday when former chairman of the Ruet-i-Hilal Committee Mufti Muneeb arrived at Wazirabad and addressed the sit-in participants.
A spokesman for Gujranwala police said they were informed on Monday by a local farmer, Ghulam Mustafa, of Wadala Cheema village along Bharoki road in Wazirabad Saddar police precincts, about the body of an unidentified man, aged 30 to 35 years, lying in his fields.
Acting on the information, a police party reached the spot and shifted the body having torture marks to the hospital for an autopsy.
The body was later identified as of constable Butt, he added.
He said the constable was returning from Wazirabad after performing his security duty when he was kidnapped and tortured to death by some TLP workers on Oct 1 night. He said it seemed the killers removed the uniform of the deceased constable, clad his body in shalwar qameez to conceal his identity and threw it in the field.
A case has been lodged against the unidentified killers under section 302 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) on the report of the owner of the field from where the body was recovered.
The city police officer has constituted a team under Gujranwala investigation SSP Syed Ali to further probe into the matter.
The martyred cop was survived by a widow and a minor daughter, the spokesperson said.
His funeral prayers were first offered at Gujranwala Police Lines and then in Wahdat Colony, where he resided. He was laid to rest in his ancestral graveyard on Tuesday evening.
The vehicular traffic was restored on the bridge on River Jhelum on Tuesday after authorities removed the containers parked there and filled the trenches dug up on the GT Road at Sara I Alamgir to prevent the participants of the proscribed TLP’s march on Islamabad.
However, the old and new bridges on River Chenab near Gujrat city are still closed for the traffic due to the ongoing TLP sit-in at Wazirabad.
The TLP had shifted the sit-in from the GT Road to the Nizamabad Park of Wazirabad on Monday, but authorities had yet to remove obstacles placed on Chenab bridges. However, pedestrians and motorcyclists have allowed to cross these bridges.
The internet and landline phone services have also been restored in the area on Tuesday after remaining suspended for the last one week.
An official privy to the security arrangements told 
 that normalcy was being restored gradually in Gujrat and Jhelum towns and the situation might get normal within the next 12 to 24 hours as release of TLP chief Saad Rizvi was expected on Wednesday, as announced by Mufti Muneebur Rehman at Wazirabad sit-in on last Sunday.

The 40-seat coaster had started its journey from tehsil headquarters Baloch and after hardly seven kilometres developed a technical fault, according to some witnesses, who said the vehicle first hit the mountain on the left side of the road and then suddenly turned right and fell more than 500 metres down the road.
A man who was selling 
 under a tent nearby saw the bus plunge and informed a prayer leader in Majhiari village, some two kilometres towards Baloch, over telephone about it.
The prayer leader then made announcements on the loudspeaker asking villagers to rush to the accident site to aid in the rescue.
			
Poonch Deputy Inspector General Rashid Naeem Khan told 
 that 22 people had died in the accident. He said five of the injured were sent to Kotli district, while three were transported to Baloch.
Sardar Farooq Ahmed Tahir, a former AJK minister in the previous PML-N government, who rushed to the scene along with rescuers, said 21 bodies had been recovered from the accident site, while one of the injured succumbed to his injuries in the Baloch Rural Health Centre.

"PM Imran announces 'biggest welfare package in Pakistan's history' to mitigate inflation impact
","November 3, 2021","Prime Minister Imran Khan on Wednesday addressed the nation to announce a package to mitigate the hardships of the inflation-hit public.
Under the Rs120 billion subsidy programme, eligible families will be able to purchase ghee, wheat flour and pulses at 30 per cent lower prices for the next six months, he said. 
At the start of his speech, the premier said the package would be ""the biggest welfare programme in Pakistan's history"", which he said would take the country towards becoming a welfare state.
He lauded the team of the government's flagship Ehsaas programme for collecting data on the financial status of families across the country. ""Until we had this data, giving subsidies was not an easy task, it was based on estimations. But since we have this data today, I am now in the position to present this relief package,"" he said. 
Prime Minister Imran said the PTI government had inherited a difficult economic situation, and thanked Saudi Arabia, the UAE and China for providing the help that saved Pakistan from defaulting. 
""We had to approach the IMF, we were stabilising the country for a year and then corona came,"" he said, lauding the NCOC for taking data-based decisions that helped Pakistan's coronavirus fight.
""We were internationally acknowledged for being one of the few countries to deal with Covid-19 in the best manner.""
Fearing unemployment, the premier said, the government imposed ""small and smart"" lockdowns instead of completely shutting down the economy. ""We especially saved agriculture and construction, which create jobs in urban areas and [increase] exports,"" he added.
Recounting the government's incentives for the construction and agriculture sectors, he said the country's economic indicators were ""positive"".
Prime Minister Imran acknowledged that inflation was a major problem in the country, saying the media and the opposition had the right to criticise the government.
But he said the media ""needs to balance and think whether inflation is rising because of our government or due to rise in prices in the international market"".
Quoting rising inflation figures in Europe and the US, the premier said the price of natural gas had increased by 116pc in the US and by 300pc in Europe, while there had been no increase in the price of gas being supplied to homes in Pakistan.
""There has only been an increase in the price of gas that is being procured from outside Pakistan,"" he said. He hinted that the country will face a ""gas problem"" in the winter. 
The prime minister noted that oil prices had risen by 100 per cent in the last 3-4 months internationally, while they had increased 33pc in Pakistan.
""When you say petrol is expensive, it is the cheapest in Pakistan, but we will have to increase the price because otherwise our deficit will increase and we will be further burdened by debt,"" he added.
Prime Minister Imran further said the price of wheat in Pakistan was half of that in India and Bangladesh, stressing that the government was ""doing our best so that you are not burdened much"".
He announced a subsidy programme to mitigate the impact of rising prices, saying it would provide relief to 20 million families and would affect 130m people.
Under the package, he said, 30 per cent subsidy would be given on ghee, flour, and pulses for the next six months.
""You will be able to buy flour, ghee and pulses at 30pc lower prices,"" he announced.
The package, worth Rs120 billion, is being given jointly by the federal and the provincial government. Prime Minister Imran said the package would be extended in the future if the conditions allowed.
			
Aside from the above, the prime minister noted that the government's Ehsaas programme worth Rs260 billion was already functioning with the aim to benefit 12 million families.
""We are also launching the Kamyab Pakistan [programme] with a funding of Rs1,400 billion to give interest-free loans to 4m families,"" he said.
The government is also providing skills education to 200,000 people as well as 6m scholarships and school stipends, the premier added.
Additionally, he said, the entire population of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had been given health cards, while the same programme was likely to be launched in Punjab in December. 
In his speech, Prime Minister Imran also appealed to industrialists and ""
"" to increase the salaries of their employees and share their profits will labourers.
The premier then addressed the opposition who he said had been protesting against rising inflation.
""I request the two big families to bring half of the money they looted and took outside [to Pakistan]. Even if they bring half [the money], I promise you and the nation that I will slash the prices of all food items by half,"" he said, in an apparent jibe at the families of PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif and PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari.
The PTI earlier said in a tweet that the prime minister would  ""announce a big public relief package in the country's history during his address"".
			
The prime minister's plan to address the nation was first disclosed by Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry on Monday, who said the premier would soon announce a ""big package"" to deal with rising inflation, providing relief to 10 million people directly.
Meanwhile, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Political Communication Shahbaz Gill told media persons that the prime minister would take people into confidence on the current economic situation and share details of the inflation package.
The government has been facing severe criticism from the opposition, particularly after Prime Minister Imran 
 a Rs10 increase in the price of petrol last month. Major opposition parties, including the PML-N and the PPP, have held countrywide rallies and protests over what they term ""unprecedented inflation in the country"".
Inflation measured through the Sensitive Price Index posted an 
 for the week ended on October 28 driven by a sharp rise in the prices of essential food items, data released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics showed.
This was the fourth consecutive week that witnessed an upward increase. Earlier, the finance ministry had 
 of inflation further rising in the country.
Last month, Planning and Development Minister Asad Umar had 
 ""immediate relief"" in rising commodity prices, saying it could take at least five months for the ""abnormal increase"" in global prices to head towards normalcy.
Even before the prime minister's address took place, PML-N Information Secretary Marriyum Aurangzeb earlier today

"India get first points, thrash Afghanistan to stay alive in T20 World Cup
","November 3, 2021","Opening batsman Rohit Sharma hit a blistering 74 to set up India's first win at the Twenty20 World Cup with a 66-run drubbing of Afghanistan on Wednesday as Virat Kohli's team avoided a shock early exit.
The Indian batting finally fired with Sharma and KL Rahul, who made 69, putting on 140 for the opening wicket to guide India to 210 for two in their must-win Super 12 game in Abu Dhabi.
The tournament's highest total proved too much for Afghanistan who finished on 144-7 in 20 overs.
They still remain in the hunt for the semi-finals along with New Zealand and India. Pakistan have already secured their place in the last-four from the group.
India, who came in as hot favourites but crashed to two straight losses, needed to win their remaining three games and depend on others for their entry in the semis.
: 
Returning off spinner Ravichandran Ashwin returned figures of 2-14 in his first white-ball international since 2017.
But Sharma remained the star with his 47-ball knock that deflated the opposition bowling after Afghanistan elected to field first.
Sharma took five balls to get going with a boundary off skipper Mohammad Nabi, who opened the attack with his off spin, and then tore into the bowling attack.
India raced to 53 in the first six overs of powerplay to signal their intent.
Rohit reached his fifty with a boundary off fast bowler Naveenul Haq and then hit a six to bring up the 100 for the opening stand.
Sharma, who had scores of zero and 14 in India's two losses, smashed the bowlers all around the park for eight fours and three sixes in his 47-ball knock before losing his wicket to Karim Janat.
Rahul soon followed his partner to the dugout after being bowled by Gulbadin Naib on a slower yorker.
Wicketkeeper-batsman Rishabh Pant and Hardik Pandya rode the momentum, putting on an unbeaten partnership of 63.
Pandya, who hit 35, and the left-handed Pant, who made 27, hit five sixes between them.
Afghanistan lead spinner Rashid Khan remained wicketless and gave away 36 runs from his four overs.
Naveenul Haq was crashed for 59 runs off his four-over allocation.
			
India's new-ball bowlers Mohammed Shami and Jasprit Bumrah took out the Afghanistan openers early in the innings.
Rahmanullah Gurbaz hit back with two fours and two sixes off Shami's third over but soon fell to Ravindra Jadeja after his 10-ball 19.
Ashwin, who came in to the XI in place of Varun Chakravarthy, got down to business as he trapped Gulbadin Naib lbw for 18 and bowled Najibullah Zadran to put Afghanistan in trouble at 69-5.
Never in the chase, Nabi and Janat, who made an unbeaten 42 off 22 balls, put on 57 runs for the sixth wicket to reduce their margin of loss.
Shami broke the stand to send back Nabi and then got Rashid Khan for nought in his final over to finish with three wickets in the match.",Sport
"Dead body recovered from PPP lawmaker's farmhouse in Karachi's Malir
","November 3, 2021","The body of a man, who was allegedly tortured to death, was found at a farmhouse belonging to a PPP lawmaker in Karachi's Malir on Wednesday, police and the victim's relatives said.  
According to Memon Goth Station House Officer (SHO) Khalid Abbasi, Nazim Sajawal Jokhio's tortured body was found at the Jam House, said to be PPP MPA Jam Awais' farmhouse in Malir's Jam Goth, at around 2:30pm on Wednesday.
He said the victim seemed to have died after being thrashed with sticks and punches during a scuffle at the Jam House. The SHO added that police had arrested two suspects in the case.
Malir SSP Irfan Bahadur told 
 that Nazim's body had been shifted to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) for the completion of legal formalities. He also confirmed that two suspects had been detained for interrogation. 
The officer said that police were waiting for the victim's relatives to file a case so that legal proceedings could be formally initiated.
Later, a case was registered under Sections 302 (premeditated murder) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code on the complaint of the victim's brother, Afzal Jokhio.
Additional Police Surgeon at JPMC, Dr Summaiya Syed, said there were ""bruises and abrasions"" on the victim's lower body. However, doctors did not confirm the cause of the death.
Afzal, the victim's brother and a former councillor of Karachi's Ghaghar Phatak area, accused PPP MPA Jam Awais and MNA Jam Abdul Karim of being involved in his brother's alleged murder. 
He and other relatives made the allegation on the basis of a video, which they said Nazim recorded. In the video Nazim said he had been tortured and threatened over a clip he shot of the ""guests"" of some influential persons hunting animals in his village near Thatta's Jungshahi town.
In the video, shared with the media by Nazim's relatives and seen by 
, the victim said he had shot a video of some persons hunting animals on his mobile phone, which led to his phone being snatched and him getting a beating. Without naming anyone, he said his phone was later returned, at which he called police helpline Madadgar-15. 
But when police did not reach for help and the ""hunters"" left, Nazim said he visited a police station to file a complaint about being subjected to torture. 
However, the victim narrated, he received ""threatening phone calls"", being asked to ""delete the video [of hunting] or face the consequences the [next] morning"". 
Nazim said in case of any harm to him, the persons at whose house the ""hunter guests"" were staying would be responsible.
“I am not afraid but this video statement of mine should be kept on record. I am receiving threats and I will not seek an apology,” he said in the video.
Enraged over the incident, Nazim's relatives and other members of the Jokhio community from Malir and adjoining areas staged a protest and blocked the National Highway near Gulshan-i-Hadeed on Wednesday.
The protesters, led by Nazim's brother, Afzal, alleged that the victim was murdered at the behest of influential persons, referring to the hunting video recorded by him.
Afzal told media persons on the occasion that Nazim had been receiving threats from the Jam House in Malir and was asked to visit the farmhouse immediately for a ""patch up"".
However, he said, when he and his brother went there, MNA Abdul Karim started beating Nazim and asked him (Afzal) to leave.
""I told him I was leaving my brother behind, trusting the MNA, and would take him away once a decision on the matter was made,"" Afzal said, adding that when he reached his house late on Tuesday night, two persons from the Jam House, Wadera Mohammed Khan Jokhio and Wadera Ishaq Jokhio, informed him that his brother had died.
“My brother was subjected to cruelty and was murdered,” he said.
Afzal urged the Sindh chief minister, Sindh inspector general of police, Rangers director general and other authorities for justice and the arrest of  ""influential waderas [landlords]"" allegedly involved in the murder.
Meanwhile, Opposition Leader in the Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh criticised officials over the delay in registering the FIR.
A statement issued by his spokesperson quoted him as saying that police were responsible for the delay in the post-mortem and registration of the FIR, which was ""shameful"".
He urged police to ensure the arrest of persons involved in the murder and assured the victim's family of his support.
Shortly after, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah took notice of the incident and directed police officials to register a case according to the wishes of the deceased's relatives.",Pakistan

Speaking at the 15th Islamic Finance Services Board (IFSB) Summit hosted by the Saudi Central Bank in Jeddah, Mr Baqir said that digital  transformation of the global Islamic financial services industry has  become a necessity for its growth and it needs to focus on innovation in  ways of service delivery to meet the expectations of today’s  tech-savvy and convenience-driven customers. 
Dr Baqir, who is the deputy chairman of the Council of IFSB, was chairing a session on ‘Digital  Transformation of Islamic Financial Services: Opportunities, Challenges  and Policy Implications’.
He said that  digitalisation of Islamic financial services offered tremendous  opportunities in achieving a more inclusive financial system for Islamic  countries, where a significantly large number of adult population is  unbanked.   
He said that development of  Sharia and prudential standards related to fintechs and digital  banking, by the international standards setting bodies such as Accounting and Auditing Organisation for Islamic Financial  Institutions and IFSB, would prove pivotal for the fast-paced  development of global Islamic financial industry and recommended setting  up of a technical working group to specifically work on these standards.
He also briefed the session about the key initiatives taken  by SBP during the last few years on the digital  front, especially in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic. He especially  mentioned SBP’s initiatives pertaining to National Payment Systems  Strategy, digital on-boarding framework to bring banking services at customers’  fingertips, digital on-boarding of merchants to  facilitate the growth of digital payments and Roshan Digital Accounts  for providing innovative banking solutions to millions of Non-Resident  Pakistanis (NRPs).
Other attendees at the summit included the central bank governors of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, Indonesia, Oman and Libya.
The  panelists discussed how digital transformation  could benefit and bring significant opportunities for the Islamic  finance industry, allowing greater accessibility, convenience, speedy  payment transactions and operational efficiency.

"November RLNG price 105pc higher than last year
","November 11, 2021","ISLAMABAD: The Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) on Wednesday notified average sale price for Regasified-Liquefied Natural Gas (RLNG) for November at about $15.68 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) which is almost 105 per cent higher than the same month last year and a fraction lower than October this year. 
The notification showed that major increase was due to expensive spot cargoes of Pakistan LNG Limited (PLL) which purchased only two cargoes for November but this shot up the average basket RLNG prices. The price notification showed the country would have a total of 10 cargoes for November instead of usual 11-12 cargoes. 
The notification showed the average import price delivered ex-ship of PLL at $24.1 per mmBtu was almost 327pc higher than $5.64 per mmBtu of same month of last year. This also included the most expensive cargo in Pakistan’s history at $30.6 per mmBtu arranged by PLL through emergency tender a few days ago after long-term contractors defaulted. 
The only saving grace for the government was significantly cheaper long-term contracts from Qatar. The RLNG for eight cargoes of Pakistan State Oil (PSO) had been secured at almost half the average sale price of $9.68 per mmBtu. These included six cargoes from Qatar at a DES price of $10.207 on the basis of 13.37pc of Brent and two cargoes at $7.887 per mmBtu based on 10.2pc of Brent under second term contract. 
The data showed that even PSO’s imports this year were almost 66pc higher than same month of last year when its average imports including spot cargoes were priced at $5.83 per mmBtu.
Overall, the average RLNG price (including both PSO and PLL) for November worked out at $15.68 this year against just $7.66 per mmBtu in November 2020. 
This was despite the fact that PLL’s portfolio included only two cargoes instead of at least six required for winter peak demand. Besides the most expensive cargo of $30.65 per mmBtu, PLL’s second cargo was also imported at DES price of $17.54 per mmBtu. 
The regulator kept the allowance for system losses unchanged at 6.68pc for Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited and 6.42pc for Sui Southern Gas Company Limited which the two companies had challenged in various courts including the Lahore and Islamabad High Courts. 
Besides system losses, PSO and PLL also charge retainage at the rate of 0.72pc and 0.5pc, respectively, of cargo price in addition to 2.5pc of import margins.  
It may be recalled that a default by two long term suppliers – ENI of Italy and commodity trader Gunvor — had created sudden gas shortages and the government had to go for emergency bidding for two replacement cargoes. 
By the deadline, the PLL received a total of five bids from three bidders for two cargoes.
For November 19-20 delivery window, Vitol Bahrain was evaluated by the PLL as the lowest bidder at $29.8966 per mmBtu followed by $30.65 per mmBtu of Qatar Petroleum Trading for November 26-27 window. The government then accepted only second cargo for second half of current month. 
The PLL is also facing a supply shortfall of about 385 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd) in December and 240 to 275 mmcfd in January and February following non-availability of LNG cargoes amid historically high international market. It had sought bids from the private sector parties to use this surplus capacity for which it could not arrange its own cargoes. 
The long-term supply contractors Gunvor and ENI had backed out of their commitments as global prices went up.
The traders chose to pay the penalty for default and go for higher profits in spot market. ENI has a 15-year contract with PLL at 11.95pc of Brent while Gunvor had five-year contract at 11.63pc of Brent. The spot rates are now exceeding 35pc of Brent.",Newspaper

The agency would soon sign a memorandum of understanding with the country’s universities with regard to cyber security, artificial intelligence and technology, said Abbasi while speaking virtually at the three-day International multi-topic conference that began at the Mehran University of Engineering and Technology (MUET) in Jamshoro on Wednesday. 
He said that pandemic had completely changed the world by shifting many vital issues and functions of governance, businesses and education etc to Internet due to restrictions on peoples’ movement enforced to contain spread of coronavirus. Social distancing would soon be over in the world, he predicted.
He said that higher seats of learning were in fact strategic assets of a nation. Though there were innumerable advantages of cyber space, criminals had rendered it unsafe, he said. 
He said that FIA’s cyber crime unit consisted of 3,500 members and was equipped with five laboratories which were looking after cyber crime cases. Last year, over 100,000 complaints were received and 70,000 had been received so far this year, he said. 
He said that 1,000 cyber criminals were arrested by FIA and 26 of them had been convicted. The Pakistan Electronic Crime Act was a new law, which needed amendments, he said.
MUET VC Prof Aslam Uqaili said that the university would establish a laboratory in the department of software engineering and information technology to work on cyber security and cyber safety in collaboration with FIA. 
He said that such conferences would provide opportunities to youths to learn and get in touch with scholars. MUET’s research and academic work maintained high standards of quality hence scholars from world’s best universities cooperated with the university, he said. 
He said that these scholars also attended conferences and seminars in MUET. The universities should help societies get rid of different problems with the help of their research work, he said.
Sir Syed University vice chancellor Dr Waliuddin said that many MUET students were teaching in his university in Karachi, which collaborated with MUET in research and academic activities.",Pakistan

"'India losing battle of hearts and minds' in occupied Kashmir, says FM Qureshi alongside OIC envoy
","November 11, 2021","Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said on Thursday that the Indian government was ""losing the battle of hearts and minds"" in occupied Kashmir.
Addressing a press conference alongside Special Envoy of the Organisation of Islamic Council on Jammu and Kashmir Yousef Aldobeay, who is on a six-day visit to Pakistan along with an OIC delegation, Qureshi added: ""And you have witnessed in the neighbouring country to the west what happens when one loses the battle of hearts and minds.""
Replying to a question, the foreign minister said he was a seeing a change in the people of Indian-occupied Kashmir.
The Indian government, he said, had created an impression that the situation was normal again in the valley. 
""But the way they 
 [late Hurriyat leader] Syed Ali Shah Geelani's body dispelled that impression,"" he said, adding that had the Indian authorities not imposed restrictions, ""a sea of people"" would have been witnessed at Gilani's funeral. ""It would have reflected the sentiments of the people, contrary to the Indian government's narrative.""
And so, Qureshi added, the Indian government lacked the courage to let it happen.
""They were worried.""
Giving the example of the Indian authorities 
 on Kashmiri students after they celebrated Pakistan's win in the T20 World Cup match against India, Qureshi said the incident showed that the ""paths of the people and government of occupied Kashmir were different"". 
Qureshi also announced that Pakistan would be hosting the upcoming session of the OIC's Council of Foreign Ministers (CFM) summit in Islamabad in March 2022, where the Kashmir issue would come under discussion in light of a report prepared by the OIC delegation visiting Pakistan and Azad Kashmir.
The foreign minister said the CFM would draw conclusions on the matter in light of the report. The conclusions, he said, would include recommendations, on the basis of which the Kashmir issue would be highlighted at multiple forums, including the UN. 
He added that he had shared with Aldobeay Pakistan's perspective on the issue and presented to him a picture of the ongoing situation in Indian-occupied Kashmir — the atrocities, injustices and torture being witnessed in the valley.
""And I explained to him how Covid-19 worsened the situation.""
Qureshi said he also told Aldobeay that apart from a humanitarian crisis, the people of Indian-occupied Kashmir also suffered huge financial losses.
According to an analysis, Kashmiris in the valley had faced losses worth $9.5 billion, he said, without specifying the time period during which the losses were recorded.
""Tourism [in the valley] has been destroyed and means of earning have been paralysed,"" he lamented. 
Criticising the Indian government for its actions in occupied Kashmir, he said following the recent steps taken by the Modi administration, distance between Kashmiris and the government there had increased. 
He added that he wished that Aldobeay would be able to visit Srinagar in Indian-occupied Kashmir and interact freely with the media there, the way he was able to do it in Azad Kashmir.
Qureshi ended his address saying he was sure that the OIC delegation's visit would have increased Kashmiris' morale and the latter would be anticipating their report.
When it was his turn to speak, Aldobeay referred to an OIC Contact Group 
 held in New York earlier this year, where the need for the visit of an OIC delegation to Kashmir was stressed so as to develop a comprehensive understanding of the on-ground situation.
""As the foreign minister said, we will now be presenting our report to the CFM,"" he said, speaking through a translator. 
The envoy termed the OIC delegation's visit to Pakistan and Azad Kashmir ""very fruitful"".
In response to a question, Aldobeay told media persons that the OIC had passed multiple resolutions on the Kashmir issue and Pakistan-India ties.
""We have also suggested forming new mechanisms for the resolution of the issue,"" he said, adding that he was hopeful that the CFM meeting would lead to fruitful results.
The envoy said that efforts were under way for an OIC delegation to visit Indian-occupied Kashmir.
To another question, Qureshi further explained that the OIC had taken a ""forceful stance"" on the Kashmir issue.
He added that the OIC was largest forum after the UN, ""and when it agrees with your (Pakistan's) narrative, its adds up to the UN Human Rights Commission's reports [on the matter]."" 
This, he said, had led to the rejection of the Indian narrative, which shifted the blame for the unrest in Kashmir to Pakistan.
""Rejection of the idea that the freedom movement in occupied-Kashmir was linked to terrorism and acknowledgement [by the rest of the world] that India is no longer as secular is a big conversion and we need to build on this,"" he stressed.",Pakistan

"More steps in the offing to cool down demand, NA panel told
","November 17, 2021","ISLAMABAD: Insisting that the rupee was currently undervalued, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Tuesday hinted at taking additional measures to curb demand in the market and inflation.
Testifying before the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue, SBP’s Deputy Governor Dr Inayat Hussain said the rupee exchange rate had depreciated by 10.3 per cent between July 1 and Nov 12. He warned that normally took ‘two to six months for the depreciation to transpire into inflation’ as terms of existing contracts expire.
He, however, explained that the severity of the impact of depreciation on inflation would also depend on the additional measures that the central bank or the government may take. “There are certain measures that the SBP can take and there are some actions that the government can also take to minimise the impact,” he said.
The meeting of the standing committee was presided over by PTI MNA Faizullah.
Dr Inayat said there was a possibility of additional measures to curb demand in case of further pressure on exchange rate but declined to talk about the level of undervaluation of the rupee. His testimony coincided with an announcement by the central bank to advance meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) from Nov 26 to Nov 19 “in order to help reduce uncertainty about monetary settings prevailing in the markets.
There are indications that the MPC could increase policy rate by 75-100 basis points to curb market demand and also to meet one of the requirements of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The deputy government declined to be drawn into the debate if and how much policy rate could be increased on IMF’s requirement. Dr Inayat said the interest rate adjustment was the mandate of the MPC and policy rate movement could be one of the required measures. He said based on IMF’s outlook about growing current account deficit, the central bank had already taken steps like increase in cash margins and import curbs of non-essential items to control monetary growth.
Responding to a question, he said some may suggest that depreciation had not resulted in export growth as anticipated because other conditions of the export growth like ease of doing business and others may not have been in place along with exchange rate depreciation. He said the central bank’s objective is to ensure financial market remains functional and let the market forces to determine the exchange rate and only make intervention in case of unusual movement.
Dr Inayat said most of currency devaluation in Pakistan had not been voluntary. When foreign exchange reserves fall and imports increase, there was hardly any option left otherwise there could be situation like that of Lebanon half of which was currently in the dark because of its inability to ensure energy supplies.
“That means the worst is yet to come,” chipped in former minister for planning of the PML-N Ahsan Iqbal. He said the government’s key argument for massive devaluation over the last three years had been export growth and current account control but exports had not increased beyond 2018 level and instead imports had went up significantly.
He said the world bank and rating agencies had highlighted current account deficit in 2018 as interim challenge based on project development which required bridge financing for two years but the current government misunderstood the issue and applied emergency breaks by increasing the policy rate to 13.25pc and devaluation, the cost of which continued to be paid by the country even today.
While discussing devaluation, monetary policy and its inflationary impact, the committee members were of the view that theSBP governor should brief the committee in person. They expressed grave concerns over the devaluation of the rupee and conveyed their apprehensions with regard to the increase in inflation.
The members were of the opinion that the rupee devaluation will not provide any space to control the inflation. The committee decided that the SBP governor should come to the next meeting for briefing on exchange rate, inflation and ongoing negotiations with the IMF.",Newspaper
"Murad insists on keeping transferred DIGs, secretaries in Sindh
","November 17, 2021","KARACHI: While the establishment division has recently transferred 12 bureaucrats, including eight DIGs, posted in Sindh to other provinces under its rotation policy, the provincial government is reluctant to relieve them, considering options as to how to keep their services in the province, it emerged on Tuesday.
Sources said that majority of the transferred officials belonging to the Police Services of Pakistan (PSP) and Pakistan Administrative Service (PAS) were unhappy with what they called growing trend of doing politics between the centre and province over an administrative issue.  
They said that they work under the establishment division and they may face show-cause notice and other disciplinary action if they were not relieved by the provincial government.
On Nov 9, the services of DIG Maqsood Ahmed, DIG Javed Akbar Riaz, DIG Naeem Ahmed Sheikh, DIG Saqib Ismail Memon, DIG Noman Siddiqi, DIG Younis Chandio (currently working in the Federal Investigation Agency), DIG Abdullah Sheikh and DIG Omar Shahid Hamid along with Planning and Development Board chairman Hasan Naqvi and three other secretaries were transferred to other provinces. 
 
The federal government had also posted officers from other provinces to Sindh to replace the transferred officials.
On Monday, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah held a meeting with Chief Secretary Mumtaz Ali Shah and Inspector General of Police Mushtaq Ahmed Mahar to discuss the issue.
The sources said that the participants of the meeting were of the view that the province was already facing a ‘shortage’ of senior PSP and PAS officials and “withdrawal” of more such officers in grade-20 might create governance issues. 
They said that it was decided in the meeting that the Sindh government would allow the eight DIGs and four secretaries posted by the establishment division to join their new assignments in the province. However, the government would not relieve the DIGs and secretaries already working in the province, they added.
Also, the Sindh government has officially approached the federal government asking the latter for what it called meaningful consultation for placement or withdrawal of the services of PSP and PAS officers.
It regretted that the federal government had increasingly shown a tendency for frequent withdrawal and placement of senior bureaucrats and police officers without having any consultation with the province.
Additional Services Secretary Ghulam Ali Brahmani wrote a letter to the establishment secretary on Nov 15 stating that the Sindh government believed that the rotation policy could not override the already existed services rules.
According to the letter, a copy of which is available with 
, the transfer of an officer “shall be made by the federal government in consultation with the provincial government or government concerned”.
“Consultation will mean the intimation of a name or a panel of names of PAS officers to be conveyed to the provincial government concerned for such a posting, preferably in writing. If there is no response from a provincial government within 15 days, the federal government will proceed to make such an appointment of the named officer or any such officer named on the panel and it will be deemed to have the approval of the provincial government concerned,” it stated.
Quoting rules, the letter added: “Procedure of deputing to and withdrawal from any province of a PAS officer will be the same as indicated above, except that provincial government may respond to the proposal within a period of one month.”
It went on to read that the rules necessitated “consultation between federal and provincial governments with regards to placement/withdrawal of services of PAS and PSP officers. However, recently the trend of transferring/withdrawing officers on the basis of Rotation Policy has gained momentum and that too without meaningful consultation.”
“Policies do not override rules which enshrine the spirit of consultation in such matters,” the letter said, adding: “It is assumed that, as laid down in law, your office (the secretary establishment) has obtained the specific approval of federal government (which means federal cabinet in the light of Mustafa Impex case) before sending the provincial government the notifications dated Nov 9, 2021 regarding the PAS and PSP officers.”
“As per law, the Government of Sindh shall put up the matter before provincial cabinet in its next meeting,” it said, adding that the transfer notifications of DIGs and secretaries would be “viewed by the provincial cabinet as transfer proposals by the federal cabinet”.
“The provincial government will get back to the federal government well within the time stipulated in Rule 15 (V) of the Civil Service of Pakistan (Composition and Cadre) Rules, 1954,” the letter read. 
The meeting of the Sindh cabinet is scheduled to be held on Thursday.",Pakistan
"LHC asks CM Buzdar to convene Environment Protection Council meeting on smog
","November 17, 2021","LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Tuesday directed the chief minister to convene a meeting of the Environment Protection Council (EPC) at the earliest to discuss the 
 in the provincial metropolis and adjoining areas.  
“It is of utmost importance that the meeting of the Council be convened at the earliest by the chief minister, Punjab to deliberate upon the calamity of smog and to issue direction for effectively dealing with the situation on an urgent basis,” says Justice Shahid Karim in his written order issued on a petition relating to the environmental issues.  
The judge said the meeting of the council shall be convened and held within the current week and a report shall be filed by the secretary to the chief minister before the next hearing on Nov 18.  
Earlier, Justice Karim observed that the provincial government was responsible for making Lahore the most polluted city. He regretted that the government deliberately failed to make the city clean and green. The judge also reprimanded the Lahore commissioner and the Punjab Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) director general for not doing on-site inspection.  
The petitioner’s counsel, Sheraz Zaka, presented a government notification of 2020 whereby smog had been declared a calamity under section 3 of the Punjab National Calamities (Prevention & Relief) Act 1958.  
The PDMA chief, present in court, had not been able to present any tangible steps which were taken pursuant to the notification.  
The judge observed it was clear that there were no follow-up steps that had been put in place by the PDMA for dealing with the calamity and it was insufficient for smog to be declared as such unless substantial measures were taken in this regard.  
The judge directed the PDMA to come up with an extensive plan to deal with the menace of smog and a meeting shall be held under the chairmanship of a judicial commission on water and environment.
Euro-5 petrol: Punjab Minister for Finance Makhdoom Hashim Jawan Bakhat on Tuesday at a meeting of the cabinet committee on smog directed the sale of Euro-5 petrol at filling station of Lahore for next month and stoppage of Euro-2 supply.
He said the district administration of the city should ensure water spray on all roads of the city on a daily basis to control dust resulting in increasing smog and anti-smog measures and laws should be implemented across the board.
Mr Bakhat said vehicles creating pollution should be removed from roads and factories and brick kilns using old methods be banned immediately. 
“Legal action should be taken against the people involved in resisting action over violation and fine should be imposed on vehicles causing pollution,” he said. He directed the traffic police to check smoke emitting vehicles and prepare their data too.
He requested the citizens to use buses and vans for pick and drop of their children from educational institutions and electric vehicles culture should be adopted and its purchase should be facilitated.
He directed the commissioners of the provinces to ensure action against the people involved in setting agriculture waste on fire and action should be taken against the factories causing plastic pollution.Petrol Pumps Association office bearer Jahanzaib Malik told Dawn that the administration was pushing the pump owners to sell the Euro-5 instead of Euro-2 due to smog. He said the government would have to ensure the availability while directing the oil companies to provide Euro-5 instead of Euro-2 oil.",Pakistan
"PPP wants allegations against former CJP investigated
","November 17, 2021","RAWALPINDI: Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) leaders on Tuesday said the 
 levelled by former chief justice of Gilgit-Baltistan Rana Shamim against former chief justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar should be investigated.
Addressing a press conference, PPP Secretary General Syed Nayyar Hussain Bukhari and Information Secretary Shazia Marri said the country was being ruled by an incompetent and inexperienced government that did not care about the poverty-stricken people.
The unprecedented price hike has made the lives of the people miserable while the weak economy could be a threat to the national security, they said.
The incumbent government has also shown cowardice by postponing the joint session of parliament, they said.
Mr Bukhari said the condition of the economy was worst and the nation was perturbed over the rising inflation.
“Prices of essential food items are skyrocketing and have gone beyond the purchasing power of the common men,” he said and added that the prices of petroleum products and electricity were being increased day by day.
He said a country whose economy was weak cannot move towards the path of development, adding the economy had weakened due to the poor policies of the incompetent rulers.
Mr Bukhari said the government had first called a joint session of parliament and later postponed by claiming that the session was postponed on the opposition’s suggestion.
He said PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari always spoke against terrorists while there was a contradiction in the words and deeds of Prime Minister Imran Khan.
He said PPP will celebrate its foundation day in Peshawar on November 30 and in this regard the party had submitted an application seeking permission to holding the event. But regrettably the deputy commissioner has not yet issued the permission.
He said the PPP chairman would visit Nowshera on November 19 where he would attend a reception arranged by Defence Minister Pervez Khattak’s nephew.
He said out of 191 countries, only 20 were using the electronic voting machine (EVM) and nine of them have recently banned it. 
Shazia Marri said not only the opposition parties but also allies of the government had already rejected the use of EVM in the next elections. She said the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had also raised 37 reservations on the use of EVM on which the ruling party ministers threatened the commission.
Shazia Marri said people of Pakistan were going through difficult times due to the anti-people policies of the government and they were worried because control of the country was in the hands of selected and incompetent rulers.
She said the chief minister of Sindh had written a letter to the speaker of the National Assembly in May to convene a joint sitting of parliament for not consulting provinces in the meeting of the Council of Common Interests (CCI) but the speaker did not call a session.",Pakistan
"Wikipedia editor 'warriors' fight lies, bigotry and even Nazis
","November 17, 2021","False Covid-19 death reports, a vast gender gap, Nazi ""fan fiction"": These are some of the perils an international crowd of volunteers battles across Wikipedia's tens of millions of online entries.
The world's largest internet encyclopedia is often the first result to pop up when users ask the internet a question — and thus a massively influential source of free information but which also reflects humanity's faults.
With entries that can in theory be written by anyone with an internet connection — in some 300 languages — it comes down to editing by mostly anonymous volunteers to police the site.
“I always carry my laptop along wherever I go, to edit Wikipedia,” said Alaa Najjar, who is based in the Middle East, but asked that specific details about his identity be omitted to protect his privacy.
 
“It is an addiction, as my friends say. I prefer to say it's my passion,” he told 
 by email Najjar said he contributes to almost 500 entries a week, and as a medical doctor he has been busy fighting a flood of false information unleashed during the pandemic.
Among the strains of misinformation that surfaced on Wikipedia, he has spotted false reports Covid-19 had killed notable people and inaccurate boosting of some nations' death and case numbers.
“I reviewed hundreds of articles during the Covid-19 pandemic, and rejected many misleading or erroneous amendments,” said Najjar, who got the platform's top honour in 2021 for his work.
The 20-year-old encyclopedia — which even has an article devoted to its own controversies — has received positive accolades in recent years for its fact-checking capacities.
Though it's a sprawling platform, the site does not seek to make money and so avoids the profit-over-safety criticism that has battered Facebook, for example.
Instead, Wikipedia has volunteers who are deeply invested in the site's stated mission of providing access to a written compendium of all branches of human knowledge.
Of course, it can be a thankless job to kick dubious reports off the platform.
“One particular editor called me a 'vandal' for removing unsourced information,” said Ksenia Coffman, who has battled what she termed “fan fiction” about World War II on Wikipedia, including how Nazis and German generals were depicted.
 
A strand of writing that ignores historical context regarding war-time atrocities such the Holocaust, and instead romanticizes German forces, has influenced a subculture that has found its way to the platform.
“Why am I getting pushback when I am trying to correct this to remove these unsourced globs of text that just glorify these supposed Nazi war heroes?” asked Coffman, who lives in California but grew up in the Soviet Union and contributes around 200 edits per month.
She said the pushback from the subculture's believers as well as from editors who didn't like to be challenged was a “tactical mistake” by her detractors that in fact motivated her to stick around and take on the issue.
And other dark spots in human history have a way of popping up on Wikipedia, too.
Women have been less well-covered than men in published written works in general, which creates a barrier to women appearing in equal numbers to men in Wikipedia's articles.
The platform requires reliable, published sources from news outlets or academia to underpin an article, noted Dublin-based volunteer editor Rebecca O'Neill.
“Wikipedia is an uncomfortable mirror to show the world because it reflects back all of the systemic knowledge gaps that we have,” she said, adding that she puts in about 40 minutes per day on the platform.
In 2015, it became clear that only 15 per cent of English language biographies on the platform were about women, sparking an effort to try to balance out the disparity. Six years later, the figure has risen to over 19pc, said O'Neill.
Last year, she was writing Wikipedia articles at the clip of one per day, and in the ratio of 19 biographies on women for everyone she did about a man.
“I as an individual can offer something. I'm just going to set aside the time and just do it and not turn it over too much in my head,” she added. “It's something I can do. “",World

"Petroleum imports almost double in July-October
","November 16, 2021","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s oil and eatable import bill recorded a sharp increase in the first four months (July-October) of 2021-22 from a year ago owing to rising prices on the international market and massive depreciation of the rupee.
The total import bill inched up by 65.4pc to $25.1 billion in 4MFY22 as against $15.17bn in the corresponding period of last year.
The steady increase in import bill of these two sectors are triggering trade deficit and pose a threat to cause pressures on the external side of the government. As a result, unprecedented increase in prices was seen for domestic users.
The oil import bill rose by over 95.58 per cent to $6.19 billion in 4MFY22 from $3.16bn over the corresponding period last year. The domestic users had to endure unprecedented increases in the prices of petroleum products.
Data released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics on Monday showed that the import of petroleum products went up by 92pc in value and 9.66pc in quantity. Crude oil imports rose by 84.16pc in value and 0.82pc in quantity in 4MFY22 while those of liquefied natural gas increased by 132pc in value. Liquefied petroleum gas imports jumped by 34.5pc.
The food import bill rose by over 37pc to $3.12bn in 4MFY22 from $2.28bn in 4MFY21 to bridge the gap in food production.
The continuing food import bill and the consequent trade deficit is yet another source of worry for the government. Pakistan spent over $8bn on import of edible items in the last fiscal year.
The food import bill will go up further in the next few months because the government has decided to import 0.6m tonnes of sugar and 4m tonnes of wheat to build strategic reserves.
Within the food group imports, the major contribution came from wheat, sugar, edible oil, spices, tea and pulses. Edible oil import witnessed a substantial increase in quantity and value terms.
Import of palm oil grew by 71.54pc in value in 4MFY22 to $1.13bn from $662.96m over the corresponding months of last year. The palm oil import bill increased due to rise in international prices.
As a result, the prices of vegetable ghee and cooking oil went up during the last few months for domestic users. The import of soyabean oil dipped by 50.24pc in value and 71.81pc in quantity during 4MFY22 from a year ago.
The country imported 731,751 tonnes of wheat in 4MFY22 against 898,904 tonnes in 4MFY21, showing a decline of 18.6pc. During the first nine months of last fiscal year, the government imported 3.612m tonnes of wheat worth $983.326m as against no imports in the preceding year.
From April to July no wheat has been imported. The Economic Coordination Committee of the Cabinet has decided to import four million tonnes of wheat for keeping buffer stock.
The import of sugar stood at 248,000 tonnes in 4MFY22 as against 226,675 tonnes last year, an increase of 9.41pc. Despite imports the sugar price is steadily on the rise.
Import of spices grew by 44.13pc in July-Oct FY22. The import bill of pulses, dried fruits, milk and other food products witnessed a massive growth in July.
The machinery import bill increased by 40.73pc to $3.71bn in July-Oct FY22 against $2.63bn over the same period last year.",Newspaper
"Shaukat Tarin assures wealth reconciliation waiver for first-time home buyers
","November 16, 2021","KARACHI: Adviser to the Prime Minister on Finance and Revenue Shaukat Tarin has assured land developers that the federal government will extend the exemption on wealth reconciliation statement for first-time home buyers beyond Dec 31.
Speaking at the groundbreaking ceremony of Naya Nazimabad Hospital on Sunday, Mr Tarin said it’s “everyone’s right to receive a tax break” when they purchase their first home. “We’ll definitely consider it,” he said after real estate developer Arif Habib demanded in his address that the exemption be extended for first-time home purchases of less than Rs50 million.
Mr Habib acquired Javedan Corporation, a cement factory on the outskirts of Karachi, when it was privatised in 2006 and turned its 1,300 acres of land into a housing project under the name of Naya Nazimabad.
“I won’t ask you to waive the requirement of a wealth reconciliation statement for developers when they buy land for housing projects. They’ve already benefited from quite a few amnesties. But please continue the fixed tax regime and wealth reconciliation exemption for first-time home buyers beyond 2021,” he said, noting that most developers are now getting their payments from allotees through cheques instead of cash.
Mr Habib drew the attention of the finance adviser to the unusually low valuation of shares listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) despite the fact that the national bourse has yielded the “highest returns in dollar-adjusted terms” among all regional economies, including China, for the last 15 years.
“The KSE-100 index is currently trading at (2022) forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 4.9 versus the historical average of 8.1,” he said while referring to the indicator that measures a company’s share price relative to its earnings. A low P/E multiple means shares are available at a discount.
Given the average P/E multiple of 14.8 in nine peer economies, listed companies in Pakistan are up for grabs at a discount of 67 per cent, he said. In terms of the dividend yield, a measure that shows dividend as a percentage of the current share price, Pakistani stocks are selling at a discount of 73pc compared with the same peer economies, he added.
He also lamented the persistent selling of shares by foreign investors. Currently, foreigners hold shares worth $2.3 billion on the PSX, which is 18pc of the free float or publicly traded shares. In contrast, their holdings amounted to $8.8bn or 33pc of the free float just five years ago, he added.
He urged Mr Tarin to restore confidence in investors as public-sector companies, especially in the energy value chain, continue to face liquidity issues because of the circular debt.
Responding to Mr Habib’s comments, the finance adviser said energy heavyweights should announce dividends and count the same towards settling the circular debt. The government owns major stakes in big energy companies and will directly benefit if they announce dividends. “I don’t want your cash,” he said, noting that the move will increase their valuations on the stock market and also bring down the circular debt by Rs300-400bn.
“When valuations go up, we can also do GDRs,” he said while referring to global depositary receipts, an instrument to raise capital by listing local companies on foreign stock exchanges.",Newspaper
"Air pollution in Europe still killing 300,000 a year: study
","November 16, 2021","COPENHAGEN: Prem­ature deaths caused by fine particle air pollution have fallen 10 percent annually across Europe, but the invisible killer still accounts for 307,000 premature deaths a year, the European Environment Agency said on Monday.
If the latest air quality guidelines from the World Health Organisation were followed by EU members, the latest number of fatalities recorded in 2019 could be cut in half, according to an EEA report.
Deaths linked to fine particular matter — with a diameter below 2.5 micrometres or PM2.5 — were estimated at 346,000 for 2018.
The clear reduction in deaths for the following year were put down partly to favourable weather but above all to a progressive improvement in air quality across the continent, the European Union’s air pollution data centre said.
In the early 1990s, fine particles, which penetrate deeply into the lungs, led to nearly a million premature deaths in the 27 EU member nations, according to the report.
That figure had been more than halved to 450,000 by 2005. In 2019, fine particulate matter caused 53,800 premature deaths in Germany, 49,900 in Italy, 29,800 in France and 23,300 in Spain.
Poland saw 39,300 deaths, the highest figure per head of population.
The EEA also registers premature deaths linked to two other leading pollutants, but says it does not count them in its overall toll to avoid doubling up.
Deaths caused by nitrogen dioxide — mainly from car, trucks and thermal power stations — fell by a quarter to 40,000 between 2018 and 2019.
Fatalities linked to ground-level ozone in 2019 also dropped 13 percent to 16,800 dead. Air pollution remains the biggest environmental threat to human health in Europe, the agency said.
Heart disease and strokes cause most premature deaths blamed on air pollution, followed by lung ailments including cancer.
In children, atmospheric pollution can harm lung development, cause respiratory infections and aggravate asthma.
Even if the situation is improving, the EEA warned in September that most EU countries were still above the recommended pollution limits, be they European guidelines or more ambitious WHO targets.
According to the UN health body, air pollution causes seven million premature deaths annually across the globe — on the same levels as smoking and poor diet.
In September, the alarming statistics led the WHO to tighten its recommended limits on major air pollutants for the first time since 2005.
“Investing in cleaner heating, mobility, agriculture and industry improves health, productivity and quality of life for all Europeans, and particularly the most vulnerable,” said EEA director Hans Bruyninck. The EU wants to slash premature deaths due to fine air pollution by at least 55 percent in 2030 compared to 2005.
If air pollution continues to fall at the current rate, the agency estimates the target will be reached by 2032. However an ageing and increasingly urbanised population could make that more difficult.
“An older population is more sensitive to air pollution and a higher rate of urbanisation typically means that more people are exposed to PM 2.5 concentrations, which tend to be higher in cities,” said the report.",Newspaper
"ECP deplores govt’s non-serious approach towards holding LG elections in Islamabad
","November 16, 2021","ISLAMABAD: Pointing out the non-serious approach of the government in holding local government (LG) elections in Islamabad, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Monday stated that if required data and notifications are not provided to the commission within 10 days for delimitation of new union councils (UCs), the commission shall initiate the delimitation process on already notified UCs.
The local government term in Islamabad expired in February this year and ECP was supposed to hold new elections within 120 days. The process of delimitation began but was halted in July, when the Interior Ministry withdrew its notification regarding union councils.
The ministry in August said in view of an increase in population after census results, the government intends to increase the number of UCs in ICT and spade work is under way to enact the new Local Government Act. However, sources said the PTI is yet to get the Act passed from Parliament. In the last elections, Islamabad had 50 UCs and the government wants to increase this number to 100.
On Nov 2, Planning Minister Asad Umar, while chairing a meeting had 
 the department concerned to expedite work on the draft Act for holding elections in Islamabad.
“This Commission therefore, under the command of Constitution and law, directs the interior secretary to provide the necessary legislation/enactment and the Chief Commissioner, Islamabad to provide the requisite data/notifications to the commission within 10 days positively.
Alternatively, the commission shall initiate the delimitation process on the already determined/notified 50 Union Councils (Urban 27, Rural 23) in the ICT with effect from Nov 25 under the Islamabad Capital Territory Local Government Act, 2015 and Rules framed there under.
In the meanwhile, the office concerned shall chalk out delimitation plan/schedule for the constituencies of ICT for perusal and approval of the Commission,” as per the judgment authored by ECP members Nisar Ahmed Durrani and Shah Mohammad Jatoi.
Furthermore, the judgement stated that during hearing of a case regarding the elections, the Supreme Court was told that federal government will fully cooperate in the holding of local government elections in Islamabad.
The commission members stated in the judgement that during hearing of the matter on March 15, 2021, the attorney general of Pakistan had stated before the august Supreme Court that the federal government shall fully cooperate in the holding of local government elections in the ICT. 
“Despite all best efforts of the commission and clear statement of the learned attorney general before the august Supreme Court, the required assistance of the federal government still lacks and the federal government’s varying stances for gaining more and more time prima facie show that the said government is not serious in holding the local government elections,” read the judgement.
It added that since the government’s term expired in February, further delay of elections would be in violation of Articles 140A and 219 D of the Constitution of Pakistan, the Elections Act 2017 and the above mentioned judgement of the august Supreme Court. In terms of Articles 7, 32 and 140A (1) of the Constitution, every province is under constitutional obligation to establish a local government system in the province and to devolve political, administrative and financial authority to elected representatives.
The judgment highlighted that in terms of Article 220 of the constitution, the federal and provincial governments are duty-bound to assist the chief election commissioner and ECP in conducting elections including local government elections and the commission cannot be dictated by any executive authority of the federation or provinces.
The first ever local government elections in Islamabad were held in November 2015, which were clinched by the then ruling party PML-N with majority. However, the PML-N did not pay heed towards Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad (MCI) and their political rival PTI after winning elections also followed the PML-N approach and failed to provide a financial package to MCI, resulting in the corporation not being able to deliver. Now, the ruling party claims that it will form a powerful local government system.",Pakistan
"HEC claims Senate body briefed on poor performance of varsities’ quality cells
","November 16, 2021","ISLAMABAD: The Higher Education Commission (HEC) on Monday said that last week it had briefed a Senate committee about the poor performance of the Quality Enhancement Cells (QECs) of universities, not the overall working of the universities.
On the other hand, the chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Federal Education Senator Irfan Siddiqui said HEC officials had briefed the committee about the performance of the universities and did not separate the QECs from it.
He also sought a report from HEC over its “changing” stance, adding media reports were based on proceedings of the meeting.
“The Senate standing committee was briefed on the performance of QECs of the universities that were assessed during 2019-20, and not the over all performance of the universities,” the HEC said in a statement.
It said the measurement standard criteria for QECs and institutional performance were different. “The yearly progress of QECs is measured on six quantifiable standards where as the performance of universitiesis reviewed against 11 defined standards. The news regarding performance of the universities has been misinterpreted by some newspapers,” the statement said.
During a briefing, the Senate committee was on Friday informed by HEC officials that performance of 32 universities, including Quaid-i-Azam University, was unsatisfactory.
Even the committee members were shocked after being told that QAU and some other major universities were underperforming.
Later, the Senate Secretariat through a press release also said during the meeting the committee was informed that the performance of 32 major universities was unsatisfactory.
When contacted, Senator Siddiqui told 
 that the committee was going to take up the matter in its next meeting and the HEC would be asked to explain the change in its stance.
The HEC said QECs were annually assessed by HEC’s  Quality Assurance Agency for their performance against defined parameters.
“Every university provides yearly progress report against the given criteria and targets which are (i) conductingself-review of institutional performance evaluation, (ii) self-assessment of programmes,(iii) accreditation of programmes by the accreditation councils,(iv) conduct self review MS/MPhil and PhD programme review from HEC, self-review, NOCs of MS/MPhil and PhD programmes,(v) strengthening of QECs secretariat, membership of statutory bodies and international QA bodies, conducting of awareness seminars/workshops, and (vi) implementation of HEC’s quality assuranceguidelines and policies,” said the HEC statement.",Pakistan
"Sindh govt sets up body to investigate Saddar market fire
","November 16, 2021","			
 
KARACHI: The Sindh government on Monday formed a committee to probe into the 
 that broke out in the Saddar Cooperative Market on Sunday and destroyed dozens of shops.
The blaze that erupted on Sunday evening was controlled after hour-long hectic efforts, but the cooling work continued till Monday evening in which one fireman suffered burn wounds.
While traders suspected some foul play, police said that an electric short-circuit might have started the fire because work to install electric meters was going on in the market on Sunday. Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah said a survey was being made to assess the losses caused by the fire.
The secretary of the Sindh cooperative department, Dr Naseemul Ghani Sahito, told 
 he formed the inquiry committee led by cooperative housing authority director Ijaz Ahmed Khatri and directed him to submit a report within 15 days.
He said the inquiry committee would ascertain possible causes of the fire.
He said the shopkeepers claimed that around 400 shops on the ground floor of the market were gutted in the fire. He said shops on the first and second floor mostly owned by tailor and being used as warehouses.
Dr Sahito said he visited the market in 2018 and wrote a letter to the association warning them about the “lack of a firefighting system”.
According to the letter dated May 8, 2018, attention of the association has been drawn towards “dismissal security system” prevailing in the market in respect of the firefighting.
“This state of situation was observed by the secretary cooperative department on his visit on April 26, 2018 as he (secretary) deplored the prevailing security system,” it said, adding: “Watch and ward system (along with keys of doors of the building) is being looked after by you (the honorary secretary of the market), therefore the utmost responsibility lies on you regarding security system especially with regard to firefighting.”
He had directed the market association to “beef up security system to pre-empt any untoward incident in future”, saying: “This office would not be held responsible for your lack of expertise and firefighting system in case of emergency.”
The Preedy police said that fireman Sikander Ali, 55, suffered burn wounds while carrying out the cooling work at the market in the small hours of Monday morning.
He was shifted to the Burns Centre of the Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi for treatment.
Area SHO Sajjad Khan said around 60 fire engines had took part in the firefighting operation that was completed at around 2am or 3am.
He said a delegation of shopkeepers led by the market president came to the police station on Monday for lodging an FIR as they suspected some foul play. However, they were called by the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry for a meeting.
The SHO said the shopkeepers claimed that there were 400 shops on the ground floor of the building and almost 98 per cent of them were destroyed. They said there were 180 shops on the first floor and 80pc of them were damaged.
He said that some representatives of the market association claimed that they had suffered around Rs1 billion losses.
The SHO said that the report of the fire brigade with regard to the cause of the fire was still awaited.",Pakistan
"Nazim Jokhio's brother seeks transfer of murder case to anti-terrorism court
","November 16, 2021","The brother of Nazimuddin Jokhio, who was allegedly murdered at two PPP lawmakers' farmhouse in Karachi's Malir area earlier this month, on Tuesday moved an application before a local court seeking the transfer of the case to the administrative judge of the anti-terrorism courts (ATC).
Nazim was 
 at the farmhouse of PPP MPA Jam Awais and his brother, MNA Jam Abdul Karim, on November 3. The victim’s family accuses the MPA and his henchmen of torturing him to death for resisting houbara bustard hunting by the lawmaker’s Arab guests in Nazim’s Achar Salaar village in Malir district.
The application — moved on behalf of Nazim's brother, Muhammad Afzal Ahmed Jokhio, by his counsel, Advocate Shah Muhammad Zaman Junejo — says MNA Karim and MPA Awais alias Gohram Khan Bijar Jokhio, being the sardars (chieftains) of the Jokhio tribe, are influential persons.
The application alleges that they killed Nazim and states that their motive behind the murder was to restrain and teach a lesson to members of the Jokhio tribe and other communities in Malir so that they do not raise their voice against any unlawful acts committed by the the suspects and their guests in their constituencies. It adds that the PPP lawmakers wanted to set an example of what will be the consequences of raising a voice against them — brutal murder as that of Nazim. 
“The same action of murdering the deceased was committed in a barbaric and gruesome manner creating fear, terror, insecurity and anguish in the minds of a section of the public, particularly the entire community of the district Malir and Jokhio tribe,” it reads.
It has been argued in the application that the case attracts Section 6 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.
The application moved the court to transfer the matter to the administrative judge of an ATC for further proceedings as per law as the incumbent court has no jurisdiction to try the same.
No order was passed on the application till the filing of this report.
During the hearing on Tuesday, the court extended the physical remand of prime suspect PPP MPA Jam Awais and five others in the case.
The court had initially 
 MPA Awais on a three-day remand to police on November 5, hours after he had surrendered to law enforcers. His remand was 
 last week after the expiry of the first physical remand.
Police brought him and five other suspects, namely Abdul Razzaq Jokhio, Ameen, Haider Ali, Meraj and Jamal Wahid, to the Malir Judicial Complex amid tight security on Tuesday. 
Investigation Officer (IO) Mujtaba Bajwa produced them before the judicial magistrate (Malir) to seek further extension in their physical remand for interrogation and investigation.
The IO informed the court that he had recovered the instrument (batons) used in the commissioning of the offence, as well as forensic evidence, but the investigation remained incomplete.
Therefore, he requested the magistrate to extend the physical remand of the suspects by 14 days.
The magistrate, however, extended the remand for two more days, till November 18, directing the IO to produce the suspects at the next hearing along with an investigation report.",Pakistan
"Profit margins of petroleum dealers, OMCs may be deregulated
","November 20, 2021","ISLAMABAD: The government is considering complete deregulation of profit margins of petroleum dealers and oil marketing companies (OMCs) with upper caps and initial increase of 15-20 per cent.  
This is based on the advice of state-owned Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (Pide) but a final decision is expected to be taken by the Cabinet Committee on Energy (CCOE) or the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet next week. 
The OMCs and petroleum dealers have been seeking increase in their sales and distribution margins by around 50pc to the premise of increase in the costs of doing business and inflation. 
The dealers had threatened to go on countrywide strike with effect from November 5 in protest against the government’s dilly-dallying on increase in their margins. On November 3, they withdrew their protest strike call after a government team led by Minister for Energy Hammad Azhar agreed to increase their margins on sale of petroleum products by 6pc within a few days. The meeting had also constituted a committee led by Petroleum Secretary Dr Arshad Mahmood and comprising stakeholders to ensure implementation of the agreement for increase in the margins through approvals from the ECC and the federal cabinet by November 15. The government team also included the chairman of the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) and the Director General Oil. 
The dealers announced on November 3 that they were calling off their protest but would go on a strike from November 20 if agreed increase in margins was not notified.
Informed sources said that about 15-20pc increase in dealers’ margins and OMC’s commission had been finalised in a summary to the cabinet committees. The summary had proposed increasing dealers commission by about 85 paisa and 60 paisa per litre on petrol and diesel respectively and about 60 paisa per litre increase for both petrol and diesel for OMCs. At present, the OMCs are allowed Rs2.97 per litre commission on both products and dealers get Rs3.90 and Rs3.30 per litre on petrol and diesel, respectively. 
The summary was held back at the last moment on the receipt of an independent study submitted by Pide. The study proposed deregulation of margins for dealers and OMCs with an upper cap at about Rs4 and Rs4.50 per litre, respectively or as percentage of sale price of petroleum products, starting with the same range of impact. 
Pide advised that best option would be complete deregulation for which the current market situation was the most opportune as various cost elements were fixed and enough players were in the market for fair competition. At the same time, Pide also called for facilitation of a fresh category of petroleum dealers alongside two existing categories for competition but did not suggest if regulatory environment was conducive. At present, retain pumps are of two categories including “company owned and company operated” and “company owned, dealer operated”. The new category should be of “dealer owned, dealer operated” on the pattern of the United States and the Philippines. 
It said country had 66 licences OMCs and 34 of them were actively operating in the market – an ideal situation for competition. On top, there were about 10,000 petroleum pumps – one third of whom belonged to state-run Pakistan State Oil which can act as price leader with overall market share of close to 50pc. 
Since, the ex-refinery or import parity price was well known along with federal excise, customs duty, inland freight equalisation margin, petroleum levy and sales tax, the margins for OMCs and dealers could be ascertained by Ogra in case these go beyond upper cap. 
It also offered another option of partial deregulation with upper cap of margins either by merging margins both the dealers and OMCs or without merger. The upper cap could be in the shape of fixed margin or up to 13pc on total capital employed on arranging product supply which worked out to be 6.5pc to 7pc of sale price of petroleum products. At this rate, per litre margins ranged between Rs7 and 8 per litre each to dealers and OMCs on both products. This also involved the cost for maintaining mandatory stocks.",Newspaper

"WTA threatens to pull events out of China over Peng
","November 20, 2021","BEIJING: An outcry over the whereabouts of Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai escalated on Friday as the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) said it was prepared to pull its tournaments out of China over the issue, prompting an influential Chinese state media editor to criticise the organisation for using a  “coercive tone”.
Former doubles world number one Peng has not been seen or heard from publicly since she said on Chinese social media on Nov 2 that former vice-premier Zhang Gaoli coerced her into sex and they later had an on-off consensual relationship.
Neither Zhang or the Chinese government have commented on her allegation. Peng’s social media post was quickly deleted and the topic has been blocked from discussion on China’s heavily censored internet.
Concern among the global tennis community and beyond has grown over Peng’s safety and whereabouts since her allegation, with the WTA calling for an investigation. Some of the world’s top tennis players, including Serena Williams and Naomi Osaka, as well as the German Olympic Committee, have tweeted.
The issue has also emerged as China prepares to host the Winter Olympics in Beijing in February amid calls from global rights groups and others for a boycott over its human rights record. The International Olympic Committee has declined to comment on Peng’s matter, saying it believed  “quiet diplomacy” offered the best opportunity for a solution.
WTA chief executive Steve Simon told CNN and other US media outlets on Thursday the tour would consider pulling tournaments worth tens of millions of dollars out of China.
In a statement to Reuters on Friday, Simon said the WTA was  “at a crossroads” with China.
“We continue to call for independent and verifiable proof that Peng Shuai is safe and that her sexual assault allegation will be investigated fully, fairly and without censorship. If not, the WTA is prepared to do what is right,” he said.
Hu Xijin, the editor of the Global Times, responded to Simon’s comments to CNN on Friday on Twitter, saying  “don’t use a coercive tone” when expressing any concern to China.",Newspaper
"Key aid group says Afghanistan’s most pressing need is cash
","November 20, 2021","DUBAI: Afghanistan is facing a looming humanitarian crisis as aid organisations struggle with ways to pay doctors, nurses and others on the ground because there is currently no way to transfer salaries to bank accounts there, the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross said.
ICRC President Peter Maurer’s comments echo those of the UN’s special representative for Afghanistan, who warned this week that the country is on the brink of a humanitarian catastrophe and that its collapsing economy is heightening the risk of extremism. The country’s economy is estimated to have contracted by 40 per cent since the Taliban took control in August.
The Geneva-based ICRC, which has operated in Afghanistan for over 30 years, is temporarily carrying in bags of cash to the impoverished nation and converting dollars into the local currency, the afghani, in order to pay some of its staffers. The ICRC has been able to do this with regulatory approval by the US Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. The ICRC also has an agreement with the Taliban-run Health Ministry that allows donor-funded payments to pass through the ICRC and bypass the Taliban, who have yet to be officially recognized by any nation.
“The main problem in Afghanistan is not hunger. The main problem is the lack of cash to pay salaries to deliver social services which have existed before,” Maurer told The Associated Press in an interview Thursday during a visit to Dubai.
“Let’s not forget that most of these medical doctors, nurses, operators of water systems and electricity systems are still the same people. It is the leadership which has changed, but not these people,” he added.
Afghanistan’s aid-reliant economy was thrown into deep turmoil following the Taliban takeover of the capital, Kabul, in August and the collapse of the US-backed Afghan government just weeks before the US withdrew its last troops.
The Taliban leadership, which recently banned all foreign currency transactions, has urged the US Congress to ease sanctions and release Afghanistan’s overseas assets in order for the government to be able to pay teachers, doctors and other public sector employees. After the Taliban takeover, the US froze nearly $9.5 billion in assets belonging to the Afghan Central Bank and stopped shipments of cash.
Since the Taliban’s ascension to power this past summer, it’s not been possible for international aid organizations to wire transfer payments to accounts in Afghanistan as currently international currency cannot be changed into local currency by a network of banks in the country.
Maurer said humanitarian organisations cannot fix an implosion of a whole country. He said what’s needed is an agreement on a sufficient injection of liquidity something he believes is possible without formally recognizing the Taliban.",Newspaper

"Pat Cummins the frontrunner to lead Australia after Tim Paine scandal
","November 20, 2021","Pat Cummins shaped up as the frontrunner Saturday to take over from disgraced former Australia Test skipper Tim Paine, with the likes of Mark Taylor, Dennis Lillie, and Steve Waugh all singing his praises.
The 28-year-old, who has served as vice-captain in both Test and white-ball formats since 2019, is widely seen as being in a two-way race with Steve Smith to assume the reins after 
 over a sexting scandal.
He stepped down after a series of sexually graphic text message exchanges with a Cricket Tasmania employee in 2017 came to light, despite being cleared by cricket authorities of any offence at the time.
Smith, who was stripped of the captain's armband and banned for a year after a ball-tampering scandal in South Africa in 2018 which culminated with Paine taking over, has support to complete a remarkable career revival.
But Cummins appears to be the heir apparent, with Smith tipped to be his deputy for the upcoming home Ashes series against arch-rivals England.
If appointed, Cummins will become the first specialist fast bowler to captain the side since Ray Lindwall did so for a single Test in 1956.
Cricket Australia chief Nick Hockley said Saturday the process to select a new captain was already in place, with Paine expected to retire after the Ashes regardless.
“As well as captaining capability on the field ... values of respect and inclusion, of making sport and Australians proud, are absolutely going to be at the forefront of the criteria we apply,” he said.
Former captain and Cricket Australia board director Mark Taylor said he expected the governing body would make a clean break with the past given the circumstances in which Paine quit.
“I think CA will probably want to go for someone fresh and clean. The timing will make it a more comfortable decision for CA to make Pat the captain.
It will be hard to go back after another controversy to Steve,” he told the Sydney Morning Herald Saturday.
“I know Pat very well, he's a terrific fella,” he added. “I think it is harder for a quick bowler to be captain, but in terms of leadership he will be very good because he's a good, solid human being.” Fast bowling great Lillie is also a big fan, having mentored Cummins in recent years.
“He's an intelligent guy but more than that, he's got real cricket smarts,” he told cricket.com.au before Paine's announcement.
Despite Australia never before opting for a fast bowler as permanent captain, Lillie doesn't see a problem, pointing to other teams successfully going down this route.
“There's been fast bowlers who have captained. Imran Khan (Pakistan), Bob Willis (England)... they are modern cricketers that have proven really strongly that a fast bowler certainly can captain the side.” 
Fellow Australia legend Waugh also has faith in Cummins, but said he would need to lean on his deputy, particularly while bowling.
“I've always thought that if he's bowling the vice-captain could set the field to give him a mental break,” Waugh said. 
“He has good acumen, the respect of the players and he's ready to go.” While Cummins and Smith are at the forefront, Josh Hazlewood and Travis Head -- who are both in the Ashes squad -- have also been vice-captain at various stages.
Paine has only stood down as skipper and insisted he still wants to keep wicket against England, but that could prove controversial.
“He's 36 years of age, he's coming back from injury, and he's got this scandal hanging over his head ... there's a lot of things against Tim Paine now,” former national selector and Test star Mark Waugh told commercial radio station 2GB.
If Paine is cut loose, Alex Carey or Josh Inglis could take the gloves for the opening Test in Brisbane on December 8.",Sport

"Ramzan Sugar Mill scam: Court orders FIA to submit challan in next hearing 'at any cost'
","November 20, 2021","A Lahore special court for banking offences on Saturday ordered officers of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) to submit in the next hearing their challan for the Ramzan Sugar Mills 
 involving PML-N leaders Shehbaz Sharif and Hamza Shehbaz, or risk being served with show-cause notices. 
During a hearing for Shehbaz and Hamza's interim bails, presiding judge Tahir Sabir asked FIA officers regarding progress made on the drafting of the challan. 
He reminded FIA special prosecutor Moazzam Habib that in a previous hearing the banking court had ordered for the interim challan to be submitted on November 20 (today). 
The FIA prosecutor replied that the co-suspects in the case — Muhammad Usman, Shoaib Qamar and Masroor Anwar — had obtained pre-arrest bails, and so the investigation was yet to be completed. 
At this, the judge asked the prosecutor to submit the interim challan just on the basis of the investigation conducted so far, and also ordered the co-suspects to join the FIA's investigation immediately. 
""The FIA ​​should state the final date [for challan submission] or else show-cause notices will be issued to the concerned FIA officers,"" the judge warned, to which the FIA asked for three weeks' time. 
The court ordered the FIA submit the challan at the next hearing ""at any cost"" as it extended the father-son duo's interim bail till December 11. 
During the hearing, Shehbaz sought the judge's permission to speak. ""I reached Lahore from Islamabad overnight. The FIA has the same case which NAB (National Accountability Bureau) has made. I am neither the director nor the shareholder of the sugar mill whose case has been made,"" he said. 
The judge said that the point made by Shehbaz had been noted before. 
The PML-N president branded the money laundering case a ""heap of lies"", claiming that as the Punjab chief minister, he had actually taken governmental decisions that had cost his own children's business billions in losses. 
""When God asks me what I have done, I will say I have not violated the rights of the farmer,"" Shehbaz told the court.. 
When the judge asked him whether his comments had any relation with the court's current proceedings, Shehbaz responded they were ""absolutely related"". 
""Look at my conduct and the FIA's allegations. To levy such allegations against me is a gross injustice,"" he said. 
The FIA official lawyer objected, saying that Shehbaz's comments were ""irrelevant"", with which the PML-N president disagreed. He called upon the investigating agency to ""prove that [any illicit] money had made it to my account."" 
The FIA had booked Shehbaz, Hamza and Salman Shehbaz in November 2020 under sections 419, 420, 468, 471, 34 and 109 — financial fraud, impersonation and forgery — of the Pakistan Penal Code and 5(2) and 5(3) – criminal misconduct — of Prevention of Corruption Act and r/w 3/4 of Anti Money Laundering Act.
According to the first information report (FIR), it was learnt that total deposits amounting to over Rs25 billion (2008-18) were received in bank accounts of various low-wage employees of Ramzan Sugar Mills and Al-Arabia Sugar Mills and accounts of fake companies set up and controlled by the Sharif group.
The FIR further said an inquiry had demonstrated that Shehbaz aided and abetted by his sons, were found to be involved in amassing wealth (pecuniary resources) disproportionate to their known sources of income.",Pakistan
"Czech model acquitted in drug case leaves Pakistan prison
","November 20, 2021","A Czech model 
 to over eight years in prison for drug trafficking in Pakistan in 2019 was released on Saturday after her 
 this month, the Czech foreign minister said.
Tereza Hluskova, 25, was arrested at the airport in Lahore for trafficking nine kilogrammes of heroin in January 2018.
Footage released by Pakistani customs officials showed authorities uncovering drugs hidden in her suitcase as she was trying to board a flight headed for the United Arab Emirates.
Hluskova, who insisted someone had placed the drugs in her suitcase, was sentenced in March 2019 to eight years and eight months in prison and was also fined.
But a court of appeals acquitted her on November 1 this year as “the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt”, according to her lawyer Saif ul Malook.
“The Czech citizen was released from prison in Pakistan today,” the Czech foreign ministry tweeted. “Our embassy will now help her arrange a trip back to the Czech Republic.”

"SC suspends IHC decision on ARY defamation case
","November 19, 2021","ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Thursday suspended a decision by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) to remand a defamation case against the ARY Network’s chief executive back to the trial court.
On March 20, 2018, the trial court had dismissed a private complaint by Mir Shakilur Rehman, the chief executive of Independent Media Corporation — the owner of 
 — against Salman Iqbal, the ARY’s chief executive (CEO). In his complaint, filed on Feb 19, 2014, Mir Shakil had accused the ARY Digital Network of carrying out a smear campaign against him through 
, a talk show, and sought an appropriate remedy.
After recording of cursory evidence, the court of Additional District Judge, Islamabad (IX), summoned the ARY CEO, along with others named in the petition.
Salman Iqbal, the ARY chief, moved an application for dismissal of the complaint. The judge accepted his plea on Jan 11, 2016.
But later the trial court, upon receiving another application, forwarded the complaint to the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) through an order on March 20, 2018, with an observation that the offence alleged by the private complaint falls within the purview of the Pemra Ordinance of 2002, and not under the defamation clause — Sections 499 and 500) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
The Independent Media Corporation (IMC), headed by Mir Shakilur Rehman, challenged the trial court order in the IHC.
The high court allowed the petition and remanded the case back to the trial court with a directive that it record evidence and rule on a legal question whether the PPC is applicable to the case or the Pemra Ordinance.
On Thursday, a two-judge Supreme court bench, headed by Justice Ijaz-ul-Ahsan, issued notices to the IMC and Independent Newspaper Corporation, the owners of Jang Group of Newspapers, after granting right to appeal to ARY chief Salman Iqbal and others.
Salman Iqbal, through his lawyer Chaudhry Faisal Hussain, had pleaded with the apex court to set aside the directive issued by the Islamabad High Court to remand the case back to the trial court and restore the March 20, 2018, decision of that court to dismiss the defamation case brought by Mir Shakilur Rehman.
The petition pleaded that the high court’s order suffered from serious legal infirmities and thus liable to be set aside since, in case the trial court comes to the conclusion that the matter falls within the purview of Pemra and referred the matter back to the authority, it would amount to going through the ordeal of facing a fresh trial.
The petition argued that the IHC did not take into account the fact that the trial court had rightfully returned the private complaint for presentation before Pemra.
“The Islamabad High Court has conflated the concept of acquittal, as envisaged under Section 265-K CrPC, with that of return of a private complaint, as ordained by Section 201 of the CrPC,” the petitioner contended.
The trial court had specified in its order that the complaint was being returned to Pemra, the petition said, adding that a reading of Sections 201 and 265-K reveals that the court order was in accordance with the law applicable to the subject.
The petition further referred to a 2017 Supreme Court judgement in a case brought by Syed Mushahid Shah in which it was held that the Special Banking Courts Ordinance of 2001 have an overriding effect and whenever a financial offence was committed within the contemplation of the Ordinance 2001, it could only be tried by the banking courts and no other forum.",Pakistan

"Possession of plots in Islamabad's E-12 still not in sight
","November 19, 2021","ISLAMABAD: The allottees of E-12 are still waiting for taking possession of their plots which they purchased from the Capital Development Authority (CDA) in 1989.
The CDA was supposed to hand over developed plots to the allottees within a year of allotment i.e in 1990. 
However, they are running from pillar to post to get their plots even after 32 years.
On the other hand, CDA last year announced that it was going to resolve the issue. Construction of roads was started which still continues at a slow pace.
Sources said the landowners (also known as land affectees) were claiming that their dues were still pending, adding they were entitled to get alternative plots before moving out of the area.
CDA officials said according to the civic agency’s plan the affectees will be allotted plots in I-12 for getting possession of E-12.
The officials said a large number of affectees had already been given compensation but still there were people who were to be compensated.
“Until we resolve the issue of affectees, we can’t make serious progress in the development of E-12,” said an engineer of the CDA. He said that recently the federal cabinet also directed the CDA to resolve the issue of E-12.
“My wife received the allotment letter of a plot in E-12 at the time of our marriage in 1989 but this sector has not been developed since then. I have retired from service and still have no hopes to build a house in this sector,” said an allottee.
CDA’s spokesperson Syed Asif Ali said the management had been focusing on all stalled sectors and during the last few years work was started in several stalled sectors, including E-12. “We are focusing on this sector,” he said.
When contacted, Special Assistant to Prime Minister (SAPM) on CDA Affairs Ali Nawaz Awan said that the CDA was all set to resolve the issue of E-12.
“Recently, the federal cabinet also directed for resolving the issue of E-12. We will develop this sector to provide relief to allottees as well as affectees,” he said.
On the other hand, there is positive development in the stalled sector of I-15 where development work is in progress. Sources said that out of the total 10000 plots, around 3000 are ready for possession.
The CDA last year started development work including construction of streets and roads and significant portion of the work has been completed. 
Officials said by the end of next year, the entire development work will be completed.

Dr Luca Maria Olivieri, the head of the mission who led the excavation campaign, said that the archaeologists discovered some of the grand bastions, towers, walls and amazing drain work on the top of Ghwandai in Bazira.
Bazira is an ancient city in Barikot tehsil of Swat, popularly known as the ‘City of Alexander’. According to experts, it is a major archaeological site after Taxila.
Dr Michele Minardi, another Italian archaeologist who was part of the excavation team, said that since the top of Ghwandai hill was strategically important for the ancient Swat from where major parts of the valley were monitored, the new discovery was of great importance.
“After the new development, we can see four main round towers on the corners of the hillock, on top of which were a huge water tank, monitoring towers and other auxiliary structures that were probably built in the Kushan period and were used in Turk Shahi, Hindu Shahi and Ghaznavid periods,” he said.
Dr Minardi said that the new discovery helped them to understand the entire structure of the castle on the top. He said that the archaeologists found the entrance point to the top of the hill which was amazing.
Cultural activists said that Bazira was one of the important sites, not only of Swat but also of the entire country where grand structures of the ancient times were discovered.
“It is a huge site with tangible and intangible history. The government must install a protection wall around the site with proper pedestrian paved ways, stairs to the top of Ghwandai and resting areas for the visitors,” said Amjad Ali, a cultural activist in Swat.
He said that that the sites of Taxila, Takht Bhai, Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro were properly protected so Bazira must also be protected in the same way.

"Action on the cards as refusal cases surface in KP's anti-measles campaign
","November 19, 2021","PESHAWAR: Some parents are reluctant to administer vaccines to their school going children in the measles and rubella campaign during which more than four million people have been immunised so far.
Officials told 
 that elementary and secondary education department was sharing information about refusal cases with the health department to be proceeded according to the relevant law. They said that they were reporting to the government about the parents, who not willing to allow vaccination of their children.
They said that social mobilisers explained to the parents about the effectiveness of vaccine and many complied while others continued to be in state of denial.
“We don’t have any authority to force people on getting jabs but we are sending names of the students, who aren’t getting vaccinated due to the refusal of the parents. Provincial government has already issued directives to public and private schools to ensure immunisation of students. The problem exists more in private schools than public sector,” said the officials.
According to them, action will be taken against the schools if they show reluctance in vaccination of students in accordance with West Pakistan Vaccination Refusal against Vaccination Ordinance, 1958 and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Vaccination (Amended) Act 2017.
The violators are liable to three-month imprisonment and Rs10, 000 fine under the law. Additionally, the administration has also invoked Epidemic Control and Emergency Relief Act, 2020 which stipulates imposition of Rs1 million fine on the schools for refusing vaccination. Such institutions can be also closed by the authorities.
“There are very few instances of refusals during the campaign which are resolved the same day. The vaccines we are administering to the people are already available in fixed centres of expanded programme on immunisation (EPI) of the health department,” said Dr Mohammad Arif, the director of EPI. He said that they had also deployed social mobilisers, who talked to the people showing hesitancy against vaccination and convinced them on immunisation of the target persons.
He said that so far, 4,014,045 people were vaccinated during the past four days that was 25 per cent of the total 15.6 million target people from nine months to 15 years of age. He said that the drive would end on November 27. He added that they were well on the way to achieve the target.
Dr Arif said that people could also receive shots at 1,702 EPI centres set up in the state-run hospitals throughout the province. He said that the ongoing effort was meant to respond to infections reported in the province. He added that the problem of refusals was reported from some private schools but with the support of district administration, the people got vaccinated after counselling them that the injections were safe and meant to safeguard the recipients against both the ailments.

Officials in health department said that there was no side effect of the vaccines. Three days ago, a few children were reported to get fainted after vaccination in Charsadda district, however, investigation showed that it was not reaction of vaccine but fear.
Both the diseases were vaccine-preventable and the unvaccinated people were exposed to blindness, pneumonia, diarrhoea and abortions, they said.",Pakistan
"Pakistan overcome batting woes to beat Bangladesh in first T20
","November 19, 2021","Pakistan recovered from a top-order collapse to beat Bangladesh by four wickets in the first Twenty20 international of their three-match series in Dhaka on Friday.
The visitors restricted Bangladesh to a measly 127-7 as the hosts won the toss and elected to bat first at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium.
Fast bowler Hasan Ali picked up 3-22 and right-arm medium pacer Mohammad Wasim Jr 2-24 for the visitors as Afif Hossain top-scored with 36 off 34 balls for Bangladesh.
But the tempting target looked increasingly challenging when Pakistan slumped to 24-4 in the chase.
Mustafizur Rahman bowled Mohammad Rizwan for 11 and Taskin Ahmed removed Babar Azam for seven as Bangladesh put Pakistan under pressure at the start of their innings.
Haider Ali and Shoaib Malik both went for ducks, the former plumb leg before and wicketkeeper Nurul Hasan showing presence of mind to run out the latter.
 
Malik was strolling outside his crease after conceding a dot ball when Hasan threw it back onto the stumps, and replays showed the veteran campaigner was late to ground his bat.
			
But Fakhar Zaman and Khushdil Shah put them back on track with a stand of 56 for the fifth wicket, both of them accumulating knocks of 34 runs.
When Shah fell, Pakistan still needed 32 runs off 3.1 overs but Shadab Khan and Mohammad Nawaz saw them home with some lusty blows late in the innings.
It was Khan who struck the winning six to take them to 132-6 with four balls to spare, leaving him unbeaten on 21 runs off 10 balls.
“Credit to the middle order, the way they showed the skills. Fakhar, Khushdil, the way Nawaz finished,” said Pakistan captain Babar Azam.

"Tim Paine — the fallen skipper once hailed as Australian cricket's saviour
","November 19, 2021","Tim Paine, who quit on Friday as Test skipper, was hailed as Australian cricket's saviour when he took over the captaincy in 2018 after a 
 left the team's reputation in tatters.
A journeyman wicketkeeper-batsman, Paine was 33 at the time and considering retirement before being unexpectedly appointed to the most scrutinised role in Australian sport.
Cricket Australia felt the softly spoken Tasmanian would provide an antidote to the swaggering, sledging, win-at-all-costs attitude that led to the Sandpaper-gate cheating affair in South Africa.
The scandal was Australian cricket's lowest ebb for generations and Paine was seen as the catalyst for a cultural change.
He met expectations in the lead-up to his first match in charge, talking about sportsmanship and respect for his opponents, before telling reporters “cricket's a gentleman's game”.
 
“We're trying to take it one day at a time, trying to build back the respect of the cricket world, our fans and the cricket public,” he said.
Paine, now 36, redefined the role of captain and won widespread praise for reforming a toxic team culture.
But he has now suddenly 
 — less than three weeks before a blockbuster home Ashes series against England — over what he described as an inappropriate “private text exchange” with a female colleague.
Cricket Australia said the scandal did not amount to a code-of-conduct breach and chairperson Richard Freudenstein praised the way Paine had led the team.
“Despite the mistake he made, Tim has been an exceptional leader since his appointment and the board thanks him for his distinguished service,” he said.
He added that Paine would still be available for selection, although in reality he is behind rival wicketkeepers Alex Carey and Josh Inglis on form, and may have played his last Test.
Paine's leadership had already begun to be questioned and most thought his advancing years would see him relinquish the armband after the Ashes.
Paine has played 35 Tests after making his debut in 2010, only to have his international career derailed for years by a 
 that required numerous surgeries.
 
He was a

While many saw Paine as the right captain at the right time after his appointment in 2018, there were some doubts over his low-key leadership style, especially after India claimed their 
 in Australia in 2018-19.
But Australia retained the Ashes in England in 2019 and series wins against New Zealand and Pakistan followed, giving Paine a record during his 23 Tests as captain of 11 wins, eight losses and four draws.

According to the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC), 120,­448,598 doses of vaccine have been administered since the vaccination drive began in the country in February this year. 
It said on Saturday that 78,845,170 people have received at least one dose of vaccine and 49,010,906 others have become fully vaccinated. 
The NCOC said in a tweet that due to ongoing national MR [measles rubella] campaign (Nov 15-27), Covid-19 vaccine administration for children between 12-15 years will remain suspended till Nov 27. 
			
It said another 319 people were infected and seven others succumbed to the virus in the last 24 hours, while national positivity remained at 0.81 per cent. 
The NCOC claimed that the number of active cases was 22,479 and 1,117 patients were admitted to hospitals as of Nov 20. 
Spokesperson for the Ministry of National Health Services Sajid Shah told 
 that it was a major achievement that over 120m doses of vaccine have been administered. 
“Although the pace of the vaccination has been slowed down due to the decision that children from 12 to 15 will not be vaccinated, we are hopeful that the number of vaccinations will again increase from Nov 29,” he said. 
Mr Shah said that the ministry was trying to make sure that 70m vaccine eligible people would be inoculated before the end of this calendar year. 
“We have ample quantity of vaccines and more vaccines will arrive in a few months through the international alliance Covax, which has pledged to provide free vaccines for 20pc population, and through procurement,” he said. 
He said as per the federal cabinet’s directives, the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap) has issued a code of conduct for health professionals and pharmaceutical companies.

Moreover, pharmaceutical companies will not be allowed to pay for the travel expenses of doctors and their family members. They have been made bound to provide details of expenditure on scientific and educational conferences and even during those conferences companies will not be able to spend unnecessary amounts,” he said.

The central bank governor while chairing a meeting emphasised the need for close cooperation among banks, SBP and FIA to expeditiously investigate white-collar crimes and apprehend and prosecute the fraudsters. 
The meeting was attended by FIA Director General Sanaullah Abbasi, bank presidents and senior SBP and FIA officials. Pakistan has been actively trying to fix its financial monitoring mechanism, especially since the country’s 
 in the grey list of Financial Action Task Force (FATF) three years ago. 
FATF placed Pakistan on its grey list of countries with inadequate controls over terrorism financing in 2018, which made foreign firms more cautious about investing in Pakistan.  
The country has been trying hard to come out of the list but it has been unable to convince the watchdogs closely monitoring the country’s financial transactions.

Announcing the decision, FATF President Dr Marcus Pleyer said that Pakistan had to complete two concurrent action plans with a total of 34 items. The country has so far addressed or largely addressed 30 items.  
The State Bank said it has taken several measures in the recent past to strengthen its work on anti-money laundering as well as taken regulatory and supervisory measures to improve banks’ controls to prevent digital and social engineering frauds.  
“In addition to better controls at the level of Financial Institutions and enhanced customers’ awareness, effective investigation and prosecution of criminals is needed to substantially reduce incidences of money laundering, digital frauds and cyberattacks,” the SBP said.
Just last month, the National Bank of Pakistan faced a 
 that disrupted its payment system for a few days, exposing the increasing risk of digital threats for financial businesses. However, the bank reported no data or financial loss.  
The FIA team offered support in strengthening cyber security at banks and suggested that banks should carry out an information security audit of their systems. 
Welcoming the suggestion, the SBP informed the agency that as per existing regulations banks are required to regularly carry out their information system audit and penetration testing. However, this would be re-emphasised to the industry through Pakistan Banks Asso­ciation.

","November 21, 2021","LEICESTER: Chelsea midfielder N’Golo Kante marked his latest return to former club Leicester City with a brilliant individual goal to help the Premier League leaders to a 3-0 win on Saturday. 
There was also a second league goal of the season for Christian Pulisic after his entrance as a second-half substitute as Chelsea swept aside a team they battled against last season just to secure a top-four finish. 
Chelsea are genuine title contenders this season, extending their advantage at the top of the table to six points ahead of the rest of the weekend’s matches. 
It helps having players of the ilk of Kante, and his goal showed another side to his incredible all-round game that helped Leicester win the Premier League at preseason odds of 5,000-1 in the 2015-16 season. 
Chelsea were already leading thanks to Antonio Rudiger’s back-header off a 14th-minute corner by Ben Chilwell when Kante collected a short pass from Reece James just inside Leicester’s half. 
He drove toward the penalty area unchallenged as Wilfried Ndidi tried to get back to him, before shifting the ball to his left foot and sending in a shot that flew into the corner, giving goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel no chance in the 28th. 
Pulisic made the points safe nine minutes after coming on as a substitute in the 62nd. The US forward was picked out in the middle of the penalty area by a pass from fellow substitute Hakim Ziyech and took a touch before producing a finish on the slide through Schmeichels legs. 
It was Pulisic’s second league goal of the season, having also scored on the opening day against Crystal Palace. 
The victory was the ideal preparation for Chelsea’s big week that features a crucial Champions League tie against Juventus on Tuesday before Manchester United visit Stamford Bridge on November 28.

It says the team analysed money trail of over 17,000 credit transactions (worth over Rs16bn) in the secret bank accounts of peons and clerks of the Sharif group (Sharif family) between 2008 and 2018. The investigation team has found “indelible and incontrovertible” documentary evidence of the direct involvement of Shehbaz Sharif, former chief minister, and his son Hamza Shehbaz in the affairs of the Sharif group which had been used as Sharif’s vehicle for money laundering, it claimed.
“Both Shehbaz Sharif and Hamza Shehbaz were holding public offices. They are fully accountable for Rs16bn acquired secretly in the names of their peons and clerks,” it says.
The FIA further says the public position taken by PML-N leader Attaullah Tarar, also a legal adviser to the Sharifs, that the agency has failed to collect evidence of corruption of even a single penny (against Shehbaz and Hamza) is totally “frivolous” and “an attempt to mislead the public at large”. 
In response to the FIA handout, PML-N spokesperson Marriyum Auranzeb said Prime Minister Imran Khan was suffering from ‘Sharif phobia’ for the past many years.  
“Earlier, there was National Accountability Bureau unleashed at the Sharifs and now it is FIA. Imran should be ashamed that his government [could not] prove a single corruption allegation against Nawaz Sharif and Shehbaz Sharif neither in the UK nor in Pakistan,” she said and added the verdicts by the UK and Pakistani courts were a “slap on the face of the PTI government”.  
Ms Aurangzeb said the NAB had failed to present any evidence against Shehbaz Sharif in the money laundering case during the last three years and now the FIA was following in the bureau’s footsteps.  
“Through this political victimisation, the government cannot mitigate the sufferings it inflicted on the people through price hike, inflation, gas shortage,” she said.",Pakistan

"Riots break out in US city over court verdict
","November 21, 2021","PORTLAND: Portland  police on Friday night declared as a riot a demonstration downtown against  the 
 of a teen who killed two people and injured another  during a protest in Wisconsin.
The protest of about 200 people was declared a riot after protesters started breaking windows, throwing  objects at police and talked about burning down the Justice Center, 
 reported.
The protesters gathered following the acquittal of Kyle Rittenhouse, 18, in Kenosha, Wisconsin.
Portland  Police Bureau Chief Chuck Lovell said shortly after the verdict that  officers were working on plans for Friday night and the weekend, 
  reported.
By about 8:50pm, about 200 protesters had gathered in downtown Portland and blocked streets.
By  9pm, windows were broken and doors of city facilities were damaged.  Police tweeted objects were being thrown at officers in the area, 
  reported.
The police tweeted: ""A crowd has gathered near SE 2nd  Avenue and SE Madison Street and participants have begun breaking  windows and damaging doors of city facilities in the area. People are  throwing objects at police officers in the area.""
			
Portland saw  ongoing, often violent protests after the murder of George Floyd last  year by police in Minneapolis. Some activists complained that the police  were heavy-handed in their response.
On Friday, a jury found the 18-year-old Rittenhouse not guilty of reckless and intentional homicide and other charges stemming from the shootings that took place in August 2020 in Kenosha, Wisconsin.
The ruling sparked protests in cities across the country late Friday — from New York to Portland, Oregon — as well as scattered clapping outside the courtroom, and it drew praise from gun rights advocates, highlighting the divisive nature of the case.
In comments broadcast by Fox News, the teen — seen smiling as he rides in a car after the verdict — said he was relieved that his  “rough journey” had come to an end.
“The jury reached the correct verdict - self-defense is not illegal,” Rittenhouse says to Fox, ahead of a tell-all interview to be shown Monday evening and a subsequent documentary about the teenager scheduled to air in December.
“I’m glad that everything went well... We made it through the hard part.” Rittenhouse’s case drew national attention, in part because it arose from the Black Lives Matter demonstrations that swept the country last year and featured a controversial mix of guns, racial tensions and vigilantism.
The teen testified during the two-week trial that he shot dead two men and wounded another with his AR-15 semi-automatic rifle in self-defense after being attacked during a night of unrest in Kenosha.
Rittenhouse, who lived in neighboring Illinois, claimed he went to Kenosha to protect businesses from looters and act as a medic.
Prosecutors countered by arguing the then 17-year-old Rittenhouse  “provoked” the events on a chaotic night sparked when a white policeman shot a Black man, Jacob Blake, in the back several times during an arrest, leaving him paralysed.
The reaction to the verdict reflected the national divide over the right to bear firearms in America — and where the line should be drawn on that constitutionally protected right. President Joe Biden warned against violence following the verdict and appealed for calm.",Newspaper
"Afghan Taliban begin paying salaries to govt employees
","November 21, 2021","KABUL: Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities said on Saturday they had begun paying government employees who had not received a paycheck since the Islamists seized power and triggered a major financial crisis.
Most government employees have yet to return to work and many had not been paid for months even before the Taliban captured power, especially rural workers.
“We are going to start paying salaries from today. We will pay three months’ salaries,” Ahmad Wali Haqmal, spokesman for the finance ministry said at a press conference.
Haqmal said salaries will be paid for the period starting August 23, adding that some government employees will be paid even for the month before the Taliban took power.
The payment will be made through the country’s banking system which Haqmal said had not been  “paralysed” since the fall of the previous government.
“It just needs time to operate normally,” he said.
The government employees will still be unable to access their full salaries.
Since August, Afghanistan’s banking sector has collapsed, and those with money in the bank have struggled to access their funds as branches curtailed withdrawals to $200 to $400 a week.
The financial crunch was aggravated after Washington froze about $10 billion of assets held in its reserve for Kabul and deteriorated further after the World Bank and International Monetary Fund halted Afghanistan’s access to funding.
Foreign donors led by the United States provided more than 75 percent of the public expenditure under Afghanistan’s previous 20-year Washington-backed government.
The rapidly worsening situation has forced Afghans to sell their household goods to raise money for food and other essentials with the local currency crashing and prices skyrocketing.
Meraj Mohammad Meraj, the spokesman for the government’s revenue department, said the authorities were in a position to pay salaries after earning revenues of 26 billion Afghanis (around $277 million) in the past two and half months.
“Only 20 to 25 percent of the economy was operational... Not all sectors are currently operational,” Meraj said at the press conference.
He added that the authorities will introduce a new Islamic tax to fund aid projects for poor people and orphans.",Newspaper
"Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai reappears at public event in Beijing
","November 21, 2021","Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai appeared at a Beijing tennis tournament on Sunday, according to official event photos, after 
 for information about her well-being.
Peng can be seen in a navy sports jacket and white track pants at the Fila Kids Junior Tennis Challenger Finals, according to photos published on the official Weibo account of the China Open — her first public appearance since her sexual abuse accusations were widely censored on the Chinese internet.
The two-time Grand Slam doubles champion had not been seen publicly since alleging earlier this month that former vice premier Zhang Gaoli, now in his 70s, “forced” her into sex during an on-off relationship spanning several years.
Following a global outcry, including from tennis superstars and the United Nations, Chinese state media reporters have released a flurry of footage purporting to show all is well with Peng.
A video from the event, tweeted by 
 newspaper editor Hu Xijin, shows Peng standing in a stadium among a group of guests whose names are announced to a smattering of applause.
			
A 
 reporter tweeted another video showing Peng signing autographs for children at what appears to be the same stadium before posing for photos with them.
Hu also posted two other videos on Saturday, the first showing Peng walking into a restaurant wearing a coat, knit cap and face mask.
			
A visible sign says Beijing Yibin Guesthouse, a famous restaurant a stone's throw from Tiananmen Square, owned by the Sichuan local government.
In the second, Peng is maskless sitting at a table chatting with people over a meal.
			
 could not verify the authenticity of the videos.
Hu tweeted in English that the second video shows “Peng Shuai was having dinner with her coach and friends in a restaurant. The video content clearly shows they are shot on Saturday Beijing time.”
The conversation revolved around “tennis matches”.
A man sitting with Peng and two women said “tomorrow is November 20”.
But one of the women quickly corrects him, saying, “It is the 21st”, implying that the video was filmed on Saturday.
The chat appears to be staged. It was filmed in the evening hours with a mobile phone. Peng appears relaxed in the footage.
Peng's claims against Zhang were the first time China's #MeToo movement has touched the highest echelons of the ruling Communist Party.
They were quickly scrubbed from the Twitter-like Weibo platform, and concerns have grown for her safety since.
Of the restaurant videos, Women's Tennis Association (WTA) boss Steve Simon said he was glad to see the images but “it remains unclear if she is free and able to make decisions and take actions on her own, without coercion or external interference”.
“This video alone is insufficient,” Simon said in a statement.
“I have been clear about what needs to happen and our relationship with China is at a crossroads.” 
The WTA has threatened to end lucrative contracts with China unless it gets word of Peng's safety.
Chinese state-media journalists have released what they say is proof that all is well.
First, state-run 
 last week tweeted a screenshot of what it said was an email from Peng to the WTA saying her accusations were not true and that “everything is fine”.
			
But doubts were flagged about the awkward language and a cursor visible in the screenshot.
Then photos of a smiling Peng emerged Friday on the verified Twitter account @shen_shiwei, labelled Chinese state-affiliated media by the social network.
			
The authenticity of the images could not be verified, and the user did not respond to 
 request for comment.
These were followed by the videos posted on Saturday and Sunday.
China's government has repeatedly refused to comment on the case.
Discussion about Peng's accusations is blocked on China's tightly controlled internet.
A growing chorus of voices in the sports world and beyond want to know where and how Peng is.
The White House has expressed “deep concern” about Peng, with US President Joe Biden's press secretary saying his administration wanted China to “provide independent, verifiable proof” of her whereabouts.
Britain's foreign office also said it was “extremely concerned” and urged China to verifiable evidence.
The UN has insisted on a fully transparent investigation into the claims made by Peng.
Some of the biggest names in tennis have spoken out about the case, including Serena Williams, Novak Djokovic and Naomi Osaka.
Superstar Roger Federer also weighed in on Saturday, saying on 
: “She's one of our tennis champions, a former world number one. Clearly it's concerning. I hope she's safe.”
Peng represented China at the Beijing, London and Rio de Janeiro Olympics and won gold for China at the 2010 Asian Games.
She is a former Wimbledon and French Open doubles champion. ",Sport

"Manchester United to name interim manager after finally sacking Solskjaer
","November 21, 2021","Manchester United ended Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's three-year reign as manager at Old Trafford on Sunday, but plan to wait until the end of the season to name the Norwegian's permanent successor.
Saturday's 4-1 embarrassment at the hands of struggling Watford was the final straw for the United board, who had stuck by Solskjaer in recent weeks despite humiliating home defeats to Liverpool and Manchester City.
Former midfielder Michael Carrick, who was part of Solskjaer's coaching team, will take charge of the forthcoming games while the club look to appoint an interim manager till the end of the season.
“Manchester United announces that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has left his role as Manager,” the club said in a statement.
“Ole will always be a legend at Manchester United and it is with regret that we have reached this difficult decision.
“While the past few weeks have been disappointing, they should not obscure all the work he has done over the past three years to rebuild the foundations for long-term success.” 
Solskjaer leaves with United already realistically out of the Premier League title race, 12 points behind leaders Chelsea, down in seventh in the table, and having exited the League Cup.
Carrick's first game in charge will be a crucial Champions League trip to Villarreal on Tuesday.
Another defeat in Spain would leave the Red Devils needing both results in the final round of matches in Group F to go their way to avoid crashing out at the group stage for a second consecutive season.
“Ole couldn't get a performance out of them in the end. The players look drained of confidence and I'm not surprised today,” said Gary Neville, former United captain and teammate of Solskjaer.
“They need to get the next appointment right and that'll probably be at the end of the season.
“They haven't planned for this, they haven't prepared for it. It's deteriorated so badly and so quickly.” 
A run of five defeats in Solskjaer's final seven league games contrasts sharply with the anticipation that surrounded the club in August when Cristiano Ronaldo made a surprise return to Old Trafford in the final days of the transfer window.
United handed Solskjaer a new three-year contract in July and also spent over 100 million pounds ($134 million) on Jadon Sancho and Raphael Varane as they looked to build on finishing second in the league to Manchester City last season.
However, Solskjaer was unable to assemble the pieces of his star-studded squad into a collective unit despite Ronaldo's return of nine goals in 14 games.
“We don't know what to do with the ball, we don't know how to defend properly and we're conceding a lot of goals,” said United goalkeeper David de Gea, whose double penalty save from Watford's Ismaila Sarr counted for nothing.
“It's not acceptable for this club and the level of players that we have. It's another nightmare.” 
Solskjaer had ridden out storms before in a rollercoaster but ultimately trophy-less three years. However, even his credit as a club legend for scoring the winning goal in the 1999 Champions League final to win a historic treble for Alex Ferguson's side was fading as he was booed by the travelling support at Vicarage Road.
“You signed me for the best club in the world and gave me the biggest honour in football,” tweeted United captain Harry Maguire. “Thank you for everything boss. Legend.” 
Zinedine Zidane, who won three Champions League titles with Ronaldo and Varane at Real Madrid, is the bookmakers' favourite to succeed Solskjaer, with Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers and Ajax boss Erik ten Hag also in contention.
But the decision to wait until the summer to make a permanent appointment could open up a wider pool of potential candidates, including Paris Saint-Germain boss Mauricio Pochettino, who has previously been linked with the job. ",World

The cabinet meeting, presided over by Prime Minister Sardar Abdul Qayyum Niazi, also accorded approval to an amended law aimed at establishing a special fund for the welfare of widows and orphans.  
The cabinet was of the view that taking care of the destitute would help reduce social evils and other crimes.  
In order to collect data of deserving persons who could benefit from the Ehsaas Programme, the cabinet decided to follow the process adopted in Pakistan for the purpose.  
The cabinet further decided to enforce a one-dish system in wedding ceremonies and other social gatherings in addition to disallowing any function, including a wedding ceremony, beyond 10pm.  
It also decided to enforce net metering — a billing mechanism — to credit the owners of solar energy systems for the electricity they add to the grid stations.

"Protocol signed for export of onion to China
","November 24, 2021","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan will export onion to China under a protocol signed on Tuesday, paving the way for more Pakistani agriculture products to reach Chinese markets.  
The protocol for inspection and quarantine requirements for export of onion from Pakistan to China between the Department of Plant Protection (DPP) and General Administration of Customs China (GACC) was signed by Minister for National Food Security and Research Syed Fakhr Imam and Chinese Ambassador Nong Rong in Islamabad.  
The two sides reaffirmed that such initiatives would further strengthen relations between the two countries. Such trade-related memorandums of understanding would bring the people of the two countries even closer to each other, a statement said at the end of the ceremony.  
Under the protocol, the DPP will conduct pest surveys and implement internationally recognised and integrated pest management practices during the growing season of onion to ensure pest-free export of the produce to China.  
The processing companies willing to export onion to China will be registered and recommended by DPP after the approval through audit for further registration with GACC.  
The work on the development of quarantine and phytosanitary procedures for export of Pakistani onion to China was initiated in January, 2019. The National Plant Protection Organisations of both countries conducted Pest Risk Analysis (PRA) and technical negotiations resulted in the form of protocol during April 2021.  
In order to ensure safe entry of onion from Pakistan to China and to prevent introduction of pests and to protect plant health under provisions of the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS agreement) of the World Trade Organisation, the two countries agreed to sign the protocol.  
Speaking at the protocol signing ceremony, Mr Fakhar Imam said that Pakistan with around 138,000 hectares and 1.8 million tons of onion production stands at the sixth and ninth positions in terms of area under cultivation and production, respectively.  
Mr Imam said that Pakistan had been exporting rice, mango and citrus to China after complying with import requirements of China. 
The current protocol would also create awareness about quarantine and phytosanitary compliance among Pakistan’s onion producers.  
Chinese Ambassador Nong Rong said the protocol would open new ways for more Pakistani agriculture products to reach Chinese markets.  
The two countries back each other and China is already supporting Pakistan for control of foot and mouth disease, and potato, beef and mutton production. 
The China-Pakistan Econ­omic Corridor would result in improvement in such trade ties, he added.",Newspaper
"Cricket Tasmania slams ‘appalling’ Paine treatment
","November 24, 2021","SYDNEY: Cricket Tasmania launched a scathing attack on the sport’s Australian governing body Tuesday over its  “appalling” treatment of former Test skipper Tim Paine, saying anger in the community was  “palpable”.
Paine, who was born and bred in Tasmania, tearfully 
 on Friday ahead of the Ashes against England over a series of lewd text messages with a female colleague in 2017 that were about to be made public.
He insisted he wasn’t pushed out, but Cricket Tasmania chair Andrew Gaggin said Cricket Australia should have shown him more loyalty.
“In conversations I have had in recent days it is clear that the anger amongst the Tasmanian cricket community and general public is palpable,” he said in a statement.
“Tim Paine has been a beacon for Australian cricket over the past four years and instrumental in salvaging the reputation of the national team after the calamity of Cape Town.
“Yet, at a time when CA should have supported Tim, he was evidently regarded as dispensable.”
Paine took over in March 2018 in the wake of the  “sandpaper-gate” scandal that rocked Australian cricket.
Then-captain Steve Smith and his deputy David Warner were forced to step down for their roles in trying to alter the condition of the ball during a Cape Town Test against South Africa.
Gaggin branded Paine’s treatment by CA  “appalling — the worst since Bill Lawry over 50 years ago”.
Lawry became the first Australian Test cricket captain to be dropped from a team midway through the 1970-71 series against England — finding out from reporters.
Australia’s cricket authorities investigated the sexting allegations against Paine in 2018 and cleared him of any code of conduct breach.
However at the weekend, current Cricket Australia chair Richard Freudenstein, who was elected to the board in 2019, said it was a mistake not to axe him at the time.
Gaggin said Paine  “should not have been put in a position where he felt the need to resign over an incident that was determined by an independent inquiry at the time to not be a breach of the code of conduct”.
Meanwhile, chief selector George Bailey will step aside from voting on whether Paine should remain in the team as a player if there is a split decision, given they have a close personal and business relationship.
Despite relinquishing the captaincy, Paine still wants to be considered for selection as wicket-keeper for the opening Ashes Test in Brisbane on December 8.
The decision will be made by a three-man selection panel comprising Bailey, coach Justin Langer and the recently appointed Tony Dodemaide.
“If the panel was not in agreeance with Tim’s position going forward and it was going to come down to a vote, then I would step aside and leave that to Tony and Justin to work through,” Bailey said on the Cricket Etc podcast.
Working against Paine is a lack of match practice after invasive surgery in September for pain in his neck and left arm due to a bulging disc.
He made his return for Tasmania’s second XI on Monday, grabbing six catches.
If selectors opt against him, Alex Carey is seen as favourite to take the gloves in Brisbane.",Newspaper
"Khalid H. Khan and his effervescent brilliance will be forever missed
","November 24, 2021","IN our very first meeting on a cold winter evening at the 
 office, Khalid H. Khan asked me if I knew the full name of Sri Lankan pace bowler Chaminda Vaas. It was the question he used to ask every new induction at the sports desk. The scoreboards he sent forward for publishing on the pages were always meticulous in detail; he used to give the full initials of each player. And Vaas’ were the longest. W.P.U.J.C. Vaas was how he would go on the scoreboard. 
Of course I didn’t know. But Khalid bhai, as he was known across the cricketing and sports media community of the country, of course knew not only Vaas’ full name but also of every other cricketer that has played the game. Over the years, thanks to him, I know that Vaas’ full name is Warnakalusuriya Patabendige Ushantha Joseph Chaminda Vaas. That isn’t the only thing I learnt from him. He would’ve been proud if I told him I’d finally learnt Vaas’ full name only a few days ago. Unfortunately I’d never get the chance to tell him that.

 afternoon at the age of 58 after suffering a cranial hemorrhage over two weeks ago, leaving behind not only a huge void for his friends, family and co-workers as well as 
 but also for cricket in the country. 
“Khalid was widely respected and well-loved amongst his peers, players and administrators for his deep affection for domestic cricket and support for the emerging cricketers and leading performers,” Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Ramiz Raja said in the board’s condolence message. Ramiz wasn’t the only one who paid tribute to him. 
Pakistan cricket star Shahid Afridi took to Twitter say “Khalid bhai was a gentle and wonderful journalist who always supported domestic cricket and performers”. 
			 
Former Pakistan Test captain Azhar Ali spoke about his passion for the game. Such was his standing that a lot of cricketers would turn to him for advice when going through a rough patch in the game. 
Such was Khalid bhai’s love for domestic cricket that he would protest when we’d ask him to file a shorter story on the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy matches because of paucity of space. “This is the tournament from where the stars of the future come from,” he would contest. In his 24 years at 
, he never missed reporting on a Trophy match. It was only when he became critically ill recently that he missed out on that. 
Only a day before he passed out and had to subsequently be put on the ventilator, he told me during our meeting at the hospital that he will be filing a roundup of the matches. That too, despite the doctors having asked him to take complete rest. Such was passion for covering the game he loved. He filed his 
 on the Trophy matches from the hospital bed on Nov 8. 
“No journalist in the country has covered domestic cricket as thoroughly and dedicatedly as Khalid did,” veteran cricket reporter Qamar Ahmed said on Tuesday. “His devotion was unparalleled.” 
Khalid bhai’s copy was always spot on, but he made sure we read it carefully “just so there are no missing words”. When he would write a punchy intro to a story, he’d call me over to his desk terminal to ask if it needed any changing. Usually, they didn’t. But when it did, Khalid bhai would always say that he needs to go back to reading to keep up with the times.
A livewire on the desk, he had an infectious smile that would light up the room. A proficient sub-editor as well, he was Mr. Dependable at the desk. Never would a strike in the city, or even heavy rains, prevent Khalid bhai from strolling into the office as if everything was okay. Khalid bhai would always find a way. If you ran into an emergency and couldn’t come to office, it was no big deal if he was there.  
A loving husband and a doting father to his four daughters, Khalid bhai spent his early childhood in Sri Lanka due to his father’s posting in the foreign service. That, he said, helped him memorise the names of Sri Lankan cricketers as he said his classmates had similarly long names. Sri Lanka was his second team and he’d fondly recall his last trip to the island country during the 2011 Cricket World Cup, when he visited his elementary school and met his friends there. 
He’d also recall his interview with cricket great Sir Vivian Richards during the Pakistan Super League with great fondness, saying it was “a dream come true”. So much so, he’d posted a picture of him and the West Indian great taken after the interview on the softboard on the desk. There are other pictures too, of him with former Pakistan captains Younis Khan and Rashid Latif.
Those pictures will continue to remind us of the brilliant man Khalid bhai was.",Newspaper
"CM Murad approaches PM Imran for retaining transferred officials
","November 24, 2021","KARACHI: Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Tuesday requested Prime Minister Imran Khan to direct the Establishment Division to fill the shortage of federal officers from BS-17 to BS-21 and depute requisite number of officers to the province.
In a letter to the PM, he also said that the provincial government considered the Nov 9 notifications of officers’ transfer and postings in the province as ‘proposals’ from the prime minister and did not agree to them to withdraw four BS-20 officers of the Pakistan Administrative Services (PAS) and seven BS-20 officers of Police Services of Pakistan (PSP).
The CM wrote to the PM that the provincial government had to respond within 30 days on the ‘proposals’ of transfers as per the Civil Service of Pakistan (Composition and Cadre) Rules, 1954.
He said that the provincial government did not agree to the proposal to withdraw four PAS officers — Hassan Naqvi, Zahid Ali Abbasi, Dr Kazim Hussain Jatoi and Khalid Hyder Shah — and seven BS-20 PSP officers — DIGs Abdullah Shaikh, Nouman Siddiqui, Saqib Ismail Memon, Javed Akbar Riaz, Naeem Shaikh, Maqsood Ahmed and Omar Shahid Hamid.
However, the chief minister stated that the provincial government agreed to the proposal of sending four PAS officers — Atif Rehman, Khalid Saleem, Noreen Bashir and Ali Hussain Malik — and four PSP officers in BS-20 — DIGs Muhammad Karim Khan, Shahzad Akbar, Muhammad Zubair Dreshak and Syed Khuram Ali.
Giving the legal aspect of the issue, Mr Shah stated that it was evident that the rules necessitated “meaningful consultation” between the prime minister and the chief minister with regards to placement/withdrawal of federal officers from and to a province.
He said that for posting of a chief secretary, the prime minister had to send a name or a panel of names, and the chief minister had to respond to the proposal within 15 days. 
“It is also laid down in the Rules that if the chief minister does not respond in 15 days, it will be considered that the chief minister has approved the proposal,” Mr Shah said, adding that this explicitly meant that the chief minister could disapprove the proposal but within 15 days.
Furthermore, he said, it was obligatory for the chief minister to seek approval of the provincial cabinet before responding to the prime minister in case of withdrawal from or transfer to a province of officer other than the chief secretary.
He said that the federal government had not posted the requisite number of officer as per the rules in the last several years. He said that out of 67 seats, only 20 PAS officer were presently available to Sindh, while only 22 BS-20 PSP officers were posted in the province against a total strength of 26.
The CM recalled that the provincial government had approached the federal government several times and wrote to the establishment division to provide the requisite number of officers against the posts reserved for them.
He wrote: “On 25-10-2021, the issue was brought into the notice of Supreme Court, wherein Attorney General of Pakistan assured that sufficient number of officers would be posted in Sindh government on receipt of details of vacant posts from the Sindh government. The Supreme Court directed the Attorney General to ensure that the problem was resolved. Consequently, the Advocate General, Sindh vide his letter dated 27-10.2021 addressed to the Attorney General communicated the details of vacant posts in Sindh government with the request to provide PAS officers of BS-17 and BS-21 as per the share.”
The CM said that while the response to provincial government’s request was still awaited, the establishment division issued notifications on Nov 9 withdrawing four PAS and seven PSP officers of BS-20 from Sindh.
“It may also be mentioned here that recently five PSP officers of BPS-20 were withdrawn from the province. Thus, the proposal of withdrawing more PSP officers would mean that half of the officers in BPS-20 will be new to the province and would know nothing about the administrative challenges.
“Dear Prime Minister, kindly consider the above as the response of the government of Sindh to the proposal of the federal government and direct the establishment division to issue necessary notifications. The establishment division may also please be directed to fill the shortage in BS-17 to BS-21 by deputing requisite number of officers to the province of Sindh,” the chief minister concluded.",Pakistan
"Cancellation of autonomy to 18 colleges: HED moves summary to Punjab CM for approval

 learnt from sources.  
The Punjab Professors and Lecturers Association (PPLA) has been consistently protesting against the autonomy to the 18 colleges.  
Sources added that the HED had proposed to the CM to advise the governor to cancel the Aug 8, 2010 notification that had granted autonomous status to 18 colleges under Sub-Section 2 (1) Clause (C)-2 of The Punjab Government Educational and Training Institutions Ordinance 1960, amended in 1984 & 2002.  
It is said Naeem Ghaus, special secretary HED, confirmed the denotification summary regarding administrative and financial autonomy of 18 colleges had been moved. Mr Ghaus assured the PPLA leaders that autonomous status of college would be withdrawn within weeks.  
It is important to note that two PML-N parliamentarians from Sahiwal district, Malik Arshad and Naveed Aslam Lodhi, had submitted two separate adjournment motions in the Punjab Assembly while Malik Nadeem Kamran, former provincial Minister for Planning and Development, had asked Minister for Higher Education Raja Yassir Humayun for withdrawal of autonomous status to 18 colleges.  
In 2010, the HED, under an ordinance, had declared 26 colleges as autonomous and recommended formation of the board of governors (BoGs) for financial and administrative autonomy.  
The HED move was strongly rejected by then PPLA through protests. Some college teachers while filing different petitions had challenged formation of BoGs before the Lahore High Court. 
The LHC bench, under Justice Ijazul Hasan and Justice Shaukat Ali Khan, had reportedly suspended HED notification of 2010 by declaring that ordinance ‘lapsed’ as it was not implemented for three years. But even after getting instruction from the court, the HED did not withdraw notification.  
It is worth mentioning that no BoGs were formed in 18 colleges since 2012.  
PPLA Secretary-General Sahibzada Ahmed Nadeem told 
 it was result of the protests by the college teachers that the HED had decided to move back on BoGs, which had been dysfunctional since 2012.

"Pakistan can bring Afghan Taliban, US closer: experts
","November 24, 2021","PESHAWAR: Speakers at a round table conference have observed that Pakistan can act as a bridge between the Afghan Taliban and the international community, especially the US, as the latter is reluctant to recognise the former’s government in Kabul.
The panelists discussed Afghanistan’s foreign policy under the Taliban, cross-border movement of militants and counter-terrorism, Pakistan’s foreign policy interests and options for Afghanistan, regional stability in Central Asia and Russia, China’s interest, China-Pakistan Economic Corridor/Belt and Road Initiative, US foreign policy options in Afghanistan, according to a statement issued here on Tuesday.
The Shaheed Benazir Bhutto Women University Peshawar organised two parallel round table conferences to discuss the Afghan Taliban’s seizure of power and transformation of the region’s security landscape. The university’s political science department organised the events.
The first discussion was based on the power retrieval of the Taliban in Afghanistan and the challenges faced by them such as their acceptance around world, the brain-drain from Afghanistan, food challenges, and the Afghan foreign reserves frozen by the US government and assistance from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, which has led to many challenges, including protection of human rights, winning of international support, and resolution of economic and humanitarian crises.
The second round table discussed the return of the Afghan Taliban to power and transformation of the security landscape of the region. Apparently, Pakistan, China and Russia will have far more influence than before in the broader Central Asian and South Asian region, the panelists observed.
According to them, while the situation in Afghanistan is still evolving, the Afghan Taliban’s ascendance to power has raised concerns that a revival of militancy could put the region at risk by vitalising the transnational militant groups and threatening foreign investments, those linked to BRI and CPEC.
Pakistan has a unique relationship with Afghanistan and remains the key player in the new scenario. The long history of turbulent relations is defined by cultural and ethnic connections, sovereignty concerns, security interests, and trade. Pakistan has a huge interest in the Afghan Taliban acting firmly and not allowing Afghanistan to descend into an ungoverned space.
The SBBWU and Centre for Global and Strategic Studies (CGSS) Islamabad signed a MoU, which included joint research collaborations, organisation of conferences, and seminars.
The panelists included SBBWUP Vice-Chancellor Prof Razia Sultana, City University of Science and Technology Prof Minhajul Hassan, CGSS chief executive retired Lt-Colonel Khalid Taimur Akram, former ambassador Ayaz Wazir and experts Syed Akhtar Ali Shah, Dr Sadia Suleman, Prof Shabir Ahmad, Imtiaz Guland Dr Raza Rehman.",Pakistan
"'Have courage and tell the public who pressured you,' Maryam tells ex-CJP Nisar
","November 24, 2021","PML-N Vice President Maryam Nawaz on Wednesday called upon former chief justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar to ""have courage"" and share with the public who had allegedly pressured him to convict her and PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif, days after an alleged audio of the former top judge was leaked.
Addressing a press conference in Islamabad with other senior PML-N leaders, Maryam said the latest allegation regarding judicial interference was the ""fifth testimony"" in favour of Nawaz, and reiterated that the PML-N supremo was ousted from power unfairly.
Her remarks come three days after the emergence of an 
, purportedly of a conversation between Nisar and an unidentified man regarding Nawaz and Maryam's trial.
In the audio clip, which has not been independently verified by 
, a voice, allegedly of the former chief justice, can be heard saying: ""Let me be a little blunt about it. Unfortunately, here it is the institutions that dictate judgements. In this case, we will have to punish Mian sahab (Nawaz Sharif). [I] have been told 'we have to bring Khan sahab (Imran Khan) [into power].'""
Nisar has 
 that the voice in the clip is his, terming the audio ""fabricated"".
In her presser today, Maryam said ""propaganda"" had been started against the ""renowned"" US company that carried out the forensic of the audio clip and reportedly stated that it had not been edited or tampered with. 
Attempts were being made to raise objections on the clip's authenticity, Maryam said, adding that certain channels were doing the ""propaganda"" that the clip had been made by compiling Nisar's words uttered on different occasions, but questioned in which speech the judge had said the most incriminating lines of the alleged audio leak: that Maryam and Nawaz were convicted and sentenced on the instructions of ""institutions"".
She asked those channels why they had not focused on the above lines or tried to prove that they had not been uttered by Nisar. 
""Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui also made a startling statement, while [former accountability judge] Arshad Malik was punished for speaking the truth,"" Maryam said, adding that although the two judges had been removed, ""nobody dared to come forward to provide justice to Nawaz Sharif.""
Justice Siddiqui in 2018 had claimed that personnel of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) were manipulating judicial proceedings, particularly the ones involving Nawaz and Maryam.
 
In July 2019, Maryam had presented recorded video clips of judge Malik in which she claimed the judge admitted to convicting Nawaz unjustly due to ""immense pressure"".
The judge, who passed away in 2020, had denied the allegations at the time, saying there was no pressure on him to convict Nawaz and that the videos shown by Maryam were ""fake and based on lies"".
Maryam today said while doubts could be raised about the latest audio clip, Justice Siddiqui and Justice Rana Shamim, who has recently 
 accusing Nisar of judicial interference, were alive. ""You can call them to get their attestations,"" she added.
""I want to tell Saqib Nisar that he will have to tell the nation the truth. Who forced you to convict Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz? Who asked you to bring Imran Khan [into power]?"" she said while addressing the former chief justice.
""If Nawaz didn't deserve the punishment, then why did you play with the justice system? You were sitting in the highest forum and why could you not refuse orders to convict Nawaz Sharif?""
She also asked Nisar why he allowed himself to be ""forced to take an unconstitutional and illegal [step]"".
""You (Nisar) will have to give its answer to the people. Leave the audio, leave [the former top] Gilgit-Baltistan judge's affidavit, and the statements of former judges and FIA's Bashir Memon. This is the fifth testimony in favour of Nawaz Sharif. Will the nation forget these testimonies? Can you deny that an elected prime minister (Nawaz Sharif) was removed from power unjustly?""
Maryam alleged that Nawaz had been expelled from his office ""for not taking a salary from his son"" and a joint investigation team (JIT) had been formed to investigate the Sharif family's assets. But referring to an 
 that recently exposed the offshore holdings of a number of prominent government members, she questioned: ""Where was the JIT when Pandora Papers surfaced?""
She continued: ""There are no proofs against me and I was [sentenced to prison] for seven years. Now NAB has no evidence to furnish in the IHC (Islamabad High Court).""
She said it was ""ridiculous"" that Nisar was not saying anything in his defence, while government ministers were defending the ex-CJP ""haphazardly"". 
""[Prime Minister] Imran Khan never called a meeting to discuss inflation, but after the audio leak he called a meeting asking his party men to discuss the PML-N tenure in public,"" she alleged, saying the ministers and the premier were actually saving themselves ""because they know they will suffer badly once Saqib Nisar is proved guilty"".
Maryam said after the ex-GB chief judge issued an affidavit, Nisar should have done the same.
""The incidents of the last five years are the biggest charge sheet against [Nisar],"" she told the presser. ""The audio tape, affidavit, Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui, Arshad Malik, and Bashir Memon are all making the same point.""
""I want Saqib Nisar to get a forensic audit conducted, face the law and build a dam from the money he gets after winning the case,"" she said, calling upon the judiciary ""not to bear the burden of someone whose truth is now out"".
Stressing politicians' responsibility to protect the prestige of the judiciary, the PML-N leader stated: ""Judiciary is bigger than these individuals. We don't want to take matters beyond a certain point [and] the judiciary should clear its name itself.""
She then quoted former chief justice Asif Saeed Khosa as writing in the Panama Papers case judgement that ""Behind every great fortune, there is a crime,"" and said: ""The crime and conspiracy that took place before the 2018 elections also stand exposed before everyone now.""
Earlier in the day, a division bench of the Islamabad High Court, comprising Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kay­ani, resumed hearing on the appeals filed by Maryam and her husband retired Capt Mohammad Safdar against their convictions in the Avenfield reference.
The court accepted the request 
, Advocate Irfan Qadir, to adjourn the hearing  without any proceedings because of him being occupied with another case.
Justice Farooq proposed that the next hearing could be scheduled for December 15, but Safdar informed the court that their son Junaid was getting married on Dec 17.
The court subsequently adjourned the hearing on the appeals till Dec 21.
On Tuesday, Advocate Qadir, who was engaged by Maryam last month, filed an application before the IHC seeking hearing on any other date except Nov 24 as he was supposed to appear before the Supreme Court.
It is a routine practice that when a lawyer is supposed to appear before the Supreme Court, he seeks adjournment in cases fixed for hearing before the high courts or trial courts on the same date.
However, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry blamed Maryam for seeking 16 adjournments since August 2018 when she filed an appeal before the IHC against her conviction in the Avenfield apartments reference.
“16th application to seek adjournment from Maryam Nawaz, and organised propaganda against judiciary and armed forces, hence these people are not less than Sicilian Mafia,” the minister tweeted.
The government has been accusing the PML-N of launching a campaign against the judiciary after the former chief judge of Gilgit-Baltistan, Rana Shamim, in an affidavit accused ex-CJP Nisar of issuing instructions to delay the release of Nawaz and Maryam till the conclusion of the 2018 general elections.
The government was also critical of the leaked audio of Justice Nisar in which he was allegedly discussing the conviction of the PML-N leaders. 
A few days before the elections in 2018, the accountability judge of Islamabad, who was working under the supervision of an apex court judge, convicted the Sharif family in the Avenfield apartment reference on July 6.
The Sharif family filed appeals against its conviction before the IHC in the second week of August 2018.",Pakistan
"Breastfeeding British MP given parliamentary baby ban
","November 24, 2021","A British MP called for reforms on Wednesday after a parliamentary official rebuked her for bringing her sleeping baby to a debate.
Stella Creasy, an opposition lawmaker who has campaigned for MPs to be offered maternity leave, received a warning after speaking at a debate on Tuesday while holding her three-month-old son Pip.
The Labour MP for the London constituency of Walthamstow tweeted an email from an official at the House of Commons citing a rule that “you should not take your seat in the Chamber when accompanied by a child”.
			
Creasy and other MPs questioned the ruling, which appeared to stand at odds with previous directives on the practice.
Alex Davies-Jones, a Labour MP, tweeted that when elected in 2019 she was breastfeeding and the Speaker of the House of Commons Lindsay Hoyle assured her she would be able to feed her baby in the main chamber of Westminster Hall, a historic building used for some MPs' sessions.
			
Former Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson was reportedly the first to do so in 2018.
“Mothers in the mother of all parliaments are not to be seen or heard it seems,” Creasy complained.
The MP has regularly brought her baby son, who is still being breastfed, to debates, as she previously did with her daughter.
“He's very tiny” and “perhaps some of my colleagues are noisier than him”, she told 
, calling for a more flexible approach from parliamentary authorities.
“It's a part and parcel of modern life, isn't it, that sometimes you might need to have your children with you.”
Despite the formal rule against this, MPs have previously brought babies to debates without reprimand.
Former Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson was reportedly the first to do so in 2018.
Creasy has campaigned unsuccessfully for MPs to get full rights to maternity leave.
“When you're a mum you can't win,” she told 
. Other MPs backed her.
“I've got quite a lot of sympathy with Stella,” Justice Secretary Dominic Raab told 
.
“We need to make sure we're in the 21st century,” he said, while adding it was up to the parliamentary authorities to “work out what the right balance is”.
The British government in February announced it would introduce six-month paid maternity leave for senior ministers, but MPs are not entitled to this.
Creasy in 2019 became the first MP to hire a locum to work on her behalf in her constituency after her daughter's birth but was not allowed to do this again.",World

","November 24, 2021","A rare white lion died, reportedly after his lungs stopped working, at the Karachi Zoo on Wednesday. 
Confirming the death, a Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) spokesperson said the lion had been suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis and was ill for the past 13 days.
""He was being treated by veterinarians but could not recover and died due to his illness at 11am on Wednesday,"" the spokesperson said.
He added that the lion was around 14 to 15 years old and was brought to Karachi Zoo from Africa in 2012.
He said a team of veterinarians had performed an autopsy on the lion's body and concluded that the animal also had pneumonia and his lungs had stopped working. 
Karachi Administrator Barrister Murtaza Wahab has, meanwhile, sought a report on the lion's death.
Expressing grief over the incident, Wahab pointed out that white lions were a rare breed, and that ""strict disciplinary action will be taken against the zoo management if any negligence is found after the cause of the lion's death comes to light.""
The news of the lion's death comes a day after the video of a starving lion, allegedly located at the Karachi Zoo, was widely shared on social media, 
.
The video of the starving lion was originally shared by

 online and led many to question whether enough food was being supplied to the animals at the zoo.
However, in response to the outcry on social media, the KMC 
 that all animals at Karachi Zoo were healthy and being provided proper feed.
KMC spokesperson Ali Hasan Sajid had told 
 that a special team had visited Karachi Zoo on Tuesday and got information about the food provided to the animals.
Sajid said that the zoo had enough food for a week for the animals and termed the reports circulating on social media baseless. The spokesperson had added that some miscreants were spreading propaganda about Karachi Zoo.",Pakistan
"Fog disrupts flights, road transport in Karachi city
","November 26, 2021","KARACHI: Heavy fog spread across the city on Thursday morning affected road traffic and also disrupted local and international flights because of poor visibility, which dropped to about 200 metres.  
According to the meteorological department, similar weather conditions will prevail in the next two days after which the weather is likely to become dry and clear for the next 10 days. 
It recorded 95pc and 42pc humidity in the morning and evening, respectively. The maximum temperature was recorded at 34 degrees Celsius and minimum at 18 degrees Celsius.  
“It’s not unusual and happens due to a sudden change in the wind direction. The wind generally moves from the land to the sea in winters. But, when it starts moving from the sea to land as happens in summers, its ability to hold moisture, influenced by other factors, reduces, allowing condensation and fog to occur,” explained Sardar Sarfaraz representing the Met department.  
Responding to a question as to whether in any way it is connected with air quality, he said people often tend to think about Karachi’s fog in terms of Punjab’s smog, though both were completely different phenomena.  
“If this form of weather persists for a longer period (as happens widely in Punjab), then one may link it with air quality. However, this is not the case here. Having said this, one must say that Karachi should have a reliable mechanism for measuring air quality across the city.”",Pakistan
"Sleeping cells of banned outfits active in Pakistan: interior minister
","November 26, 2021","ISLAMABAD: Sleeping cells of certain banned outfits are active in the country, said Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed here on Thursday.

“Anti-state elements do not miss any opportunity of sabotage and the issue would be resolved if police joined hands with the citizens.”
Mr Ahmed said the police did not get the facilities and pay which they deserved. 
People wanted the police to resolve every issue, he said, adding challenges for the law enforcement agencies had increased.
Criminals have become high-tech and crime get more coverage in the media. The ASPs got high-tech, anti-cybercrime training, he said.
People have two cameras in their pockets, Mr Ahmed said, adding a video clip of people fighting police gets viral within no time. But anyone who mistreats police should be handcuffed, the minister said, adding crime will decrease if police get respect in society. 
The minister said a decision regarding allocation of 30 acres for the NPA will be taken in the current week.
He congratulated the officers on completing their basic training. Appreciating efforts of the NPA in the capacity building of police and other law enforcement agencies, he said the role and duties of law enforcement agencies in the stability and socioeconomic advancement of the country was of pivotal importance.
The nation is indebted to police for its sacrifices in the war against terrorism, he said. He added thattraining and courses for the police officers had been designed on modern lines with due emphasis on fundamental rights and rule of law.

"IHC orders meeting of missing journalist Mudassar Mehmood’s family with govt officials
","November 26, 2021","ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Thursday directed the secretary interior to arrange a meeting of the legal heirs of missing journalist Mudassar Mehmood with highest state functionaries.
IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah issued the direction while hearing a petition filed by Rana Mehmood Ikram, father of the missing journalist.
The petitioner moved the court stating that the state could not satisfy him regarding the status of his son, Mudassar Mehmood, who went missing on August 19, 2018.
Despite filing a report, the concerned police station did not register a criminal case. In October 2018, the petitioner submitted a petition to the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances and pursuant to its proceedings a belated criminal case was registered.
Justice Minallah observed: “The buck stops at the prime minister and members of the federal cabinet because collectively they constitute the federal government. It is an onerous duty of the latter to dispel apprehensions and doubts of the petitioner and other loved ones of Mudassar Mehmood regarding involvement of the state or its institutions in his status as a missing person.”
The court directed the secretary Ministry of Interior to arrange a meeting of the petitioner, mother, wife and the three year-old-son of Mudassar Mehmood with the federal cabinet, the prime minister and its members.
A joint investigation team was constituted but the petitioner asserted that its report was not provided to him.
The last hearing before the commission was held on April 9, 2021. The commission submitted a report stating that the “missing person has gone on his own.”
Justice Minallah noted that the phenomenon of ‘enforced disappearances’ had not been alien in Pakistan. It cannot be denied that deprivation of liberty of citizens by agents of the state or by persons or groups acting with the authorisation, support or acquiescence of the state has been acknowledged by public functionaries in several cases in the past.
He observed that “the phenomenon of ‘enforced disappearances’ definitely constitutes a grave crime against humanity.” 
The court noted that the attitude of the authorities while dealing with the case had raised questions in the minds of the loved ones of Mudassar Mehmood regarding the role of the state and its involvement in his disappearance.
“Prima facie, they have reason to believe that the State and its functionaries are involved in the alleged abduction. This may not be true but the way they have been dealt with has given the loved ones reasonable grounds to believe the involvement of the State and its functionaries in the alleged abduction of Mudassar Mehmood,” the court order stated.
“It was, and continuous to be a constitutional obligation of the State to satisfy Mudassar Mehmood’s parents, wife and his three-year-old child that its institutions and functionaries are not involved, directly or indirectly, in the alleged act of abduction,” it added.",Pakistan

","November 26, 2021","ISLAMABAD: Adviser to the Prime Minister on Finance and Revenue Shaukat Tarin on Thursday emphasised the need for creating awareness and increasing outreach of mutual fund market to mobilise savings and investment in the country.

Highlighting the importance of capital market, Mr Tarin said the government was determined to uplift the living standards of all segments of the society. “The government is encouraging the investment opportunities and stimulating economic activities in Pakistan,” he added.
He assured the delegation of government’s all out facilitation and cooperation in resolution of its issues and extended support to flourish the mutual fund market in Pakistan.

"70 enterprises get active status in special economic zones
","November 26, 2021","KARACHI: Within five months of its establishment in January this year, the Special Economic Zone Management Information System (SEZMIS) has facilitated speedy grant of the active zone status to 70 enterprises by the Board of Approvals (BOA) compared to 200 in the last eight years, said the State Bank’s report on Special Economic Zones in Pakistan.
SEZMIS is a digital solution for registering zones for BOA’s approval, and allocating plots and zone enterprise status to enterprises within the zone through an application made to the SEZ Committee. It has increased the efficiency of the filing system and contributes towards creating an enabling business environment.
As per the latest regulations, potential zone enterprises have to submit an online application to purchase land from the developer and apply for zone enterprise status through SEZMIS maintained by the Board of Investment (BoI).
In the last eight years the foreign direct investment (FDI) committed was $1,081.7 million while in first five months (January-May 2021) of SEZMIS establishment the FDI commitments rose to $646.6m.
However, the State Bank analysed the current SEZs situation in Pakistan with comparative study of the region as well as global trend.
The two main rationales and conceptions of SEZs around the world are islands of excellence and laboratories for policy reforms.” In both these conceptions, the SEZs in Pakistan have room for improvement,” said the SBP.
The current SEZ framework and the ensuing government decisions have envisioned SEZs as designated areas that offer a business friendly environment as per international best practices. “There have been some positive developments recently, such as the passing of the SEZMIS regulations, which prevent real estate speculation,” said the report.
However, that vision is yet to be fully implemented; the one stop shop has not been set up, whereas overlapping coordination functions have led to delays in provision of infrastructure and utilities.
“In addition, policy frameworks to ensure business friendly climate in SEZs with respect to skilled labour and facilitative legal environment have not been announced,” said the report.
As far as policy reforms are concerned, the current SEZ framework does not envision SEZs in Pakistan as areas that offer special policy and regulatory environment to businesses, said the report.
Under current SEZ framework, all the SEZ authorities, organisations and persons engaged in the creation, development, operations and management of a SEZ are required to follow respective applicable laws and standards of Pakistan including vis-à-vis environment, employment, procurement, and building code, unless specifically exempted, relaxed or otherwise provided in the SEZ Act, it added.
“However, the current SEZ framework does not offer exemptions, with the exception of building codes,” said the report.
Here, Bangladesh’s SEZ Act offers some useful insights. Not only does it exempt the SEZs in Bangladesh from various national and local government laws, it also allows the government to modify any other Act or do any other thing necessary to remove difficulties for growth and development of SEZs.
“A concerted effort is required to address the challenges to the growth of SEZs in Pakistan, by graduating the SEZ framework from one that focuses on first-time colonisation to one that also provides direction on operation and maintenance, financing, sustainability, monitoring and operation, and so forth,” said the report.
This necessitates deliberations over the creation of a separate centralised autonomous SEZ authority that would perform several functions. In addition to approving zones and developers, these functions include providing and updating regulatory guidelines; coordinating with relevant government departments across different levels on SEZ related matters; continuously monitoring zone performance aimed at providing best infrastructure and facilities within the SEZs; and assessing the impact of various policy reforms on the business climate within the SEZs.",Newspaper
"Quest for quality education
","November 26, 2021","UNIVERSITY students from across Pakistan will be protesting today. One of their demands is for the recent fee hike to be taken back and for tuition fees and other educational expenses to be kept low. For the school sector the problem, not the solution, is simpler. Article 25A of the Constitution clearly states that all five- to 16-year-olds should have access to ‘free’ education. They should not be charged for education, up to matriculation at least, under this article.
But providing quality education is expensive. Buildings, infrastructure, teachers, materials and management cost a lot. The cost of each item is higher if minimum quality standards are to be observed. If public-sector schools cannot charge students for costs, the government/ society must find a way to pay the cost of education. For now, the government pays all expenses. But schools are severely underfunded so the provision is at a significant cost on both fronts: access to education and quality of education.
 
For better access, as Article 25A stipulates, we’ll have to increase funding for the education sector significantly. The same applies if we want to improve the quality. Not every rupee of the current allocation for education is being spent in the most efficient way, but even if all the 
 and poor allocations were to be remedied, we would still need more resources to provide for all children who are out of school and for ensuring better-quality provision for all who are and will be in school. Society must acknowledge this if 25A and ‘Education for All’ are to be a goal.
At the university level, the argument gets more complex. There is no ‘right’ to university education in Pakistani law. We need many university-educated people for sustainable growth of the economy. University education also provides significant private returns so it is understandable that several young people want university degrees. But these arguments are not rights-based arguments. They are arguments about the instrumentality of higher education.
The private returns argument (if I get a degree I can have higher returns in the future which will be good for my family and me) doesn’t give much support for public funding of university education. Why should the state fund a person for his or her private gains? The state will have an interest if private returns to a person create some public returns for society too. The argument will have to be on the basis that having more university educated people allows Pakistan to have better human resources across all work sectors, makes higher and sustainable growth possible, improves the quality of life, and possibly, has benefits on the side of governance too. These arguments will justify subsidising education to ensure society gets the benefits mentioned.
In particular, if we feel that people should have opportunities based on potential and merit, and not their ability to pay, thus making higher education accessible to people who can’t afford to pay for it, it becomes an important policy goal for the government. But this still does not mean that every person who can, should have access to higher education. The instrumental arguments do not establish rights and do not cover all people who fall in a particular age or education level category.
How do we then see the students’ demand to keep higher education costs low? It is a complex issue. Higher education is even more expensive to provide than school education. For sciences, laboratories are a major expense. For all subjects, faculty salary is the biggest ticket item. At higher education levels, research becomes an integral part of education provision and funding for it demands a significant proportion of funds too. If universities cannot charge students, where will they get the money from? Higher education funding for the last three years or so hasn’t increased. In some years, in fact, funding has decreased. So, how do we square the circle?
 
 have also been eroding the power of budgets set in nominal terms. Faculty and staff have been arguing for higher salaries. If faculty/ staff salaries do not keep pace with inflationary pressures and the opportunity costs of being at a particular university or in academia in general, people start leaving and this has an impact on the quality of provision: we do want the very best teachers and researchers we can get.
It is unlikely that philanthropy will fill the gap for subsidising quality education for all (school level) and for those who have potential/ merit (university level). Philanthropy, though not insubstantial in Pakistan, is mainly not through formalised channels. The share of education is also not too large and very little of it, even out of the amount that goes towards education, is for higher learning. Currently, we do not have a significant local funding base for research. Most research funding for now comes from the university’s own funds, HEC or overseas donors.
Quality education for every child up to matriculation or intermediate and for those who have the merit/ potential to attend university and contribute to national development is important. But quality education costs money. Given the levels of poverty in Pakistan and overall income distribution, most parents cannot pay for it. The state has taken on the responsibility of giving quality education to all children for the first 10 years. But it is not giving priority to this goal even now. Higher education too remains severely underfunded even when only a small number of those who should be getting higher education are doing so. And it seems the state has no intention of increasing funding for education in the near future. We seem to be in a poor equilibrium and there seems to be no way out of it for now. So, all children will not get education, and compromises on quality, for those who are in schools and universities, will continue.",Pakistan
"IHC throws out contempt petition against Maryam, Abbasi for 'scandalising' ex-CJP Nisar
","November 26, 2021","The Islamabad High Court on Friday threw out as inadmissible a petition seeking contempt proceedings against PML-N leaders — Maryam Nawaz and Shahid Khaqan Abbasi — for ""scandalising"" former chief justice of Pakistan, Saqib Nisar, and subjecting him to ""character assassination"".
Abbasi had on November 15 demanded that a suo motu notice be taken against Nisar after former chief judge of Gilgit-Baltistan, Rana Shamim, accused him of being involved in denying bail to PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif and Maryam ahead of the 2018 general elections.
""If Mian Nawaz Sharif can go to jail, why can't Mian Saqib Nisar?"" Abbasi had said in a statement after the allegation by Shamim made the news.
 
 
Abbasi's comments had come after an 
, published in 
 by journalist Ansar Abbasi, quoted the former top judge of GB as saying in an alleged affidavit that he had witnessed Nisar relaying instructions to a high court judge to not release Nawaz and Maryam in the corruption references against them.
Throwing out the petition, filed by Advocate Kulsoom Khaliq, IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah said in his written order that a judge who ceased to hold a judicial office ""attains the status of a private citizen"".
""Such a person is no more a member of the ‘Court’ in the context of Article 204 of the
Constitution nor under the Ordinance of 2003,"" Justice Minallah wrote.
He further said that as a private citizen, ""it remains open to a retired judicial officer to seek remedies available in a court of law. However, 
.""
The court said judges were entrusted with an ""onerous duty to serve the people through the fountain of justice and they are 
"".
""An independent judge would not be influenced nor affected in any other manner because of public
criticism,"" he continued.
The IHC chief justice explained that the exercise of the power of contempt would be justified only if it was in the public interest.
""In the case in hand, the petitioner seems to be hurt because a former Chief Justice of Pakistan has been publicly criticised in his individual capacity. This definitely does not attract the offence of contempt,"" the order read.
Earlier during the hearing, Justice Minallah observed that remarks about retired officials did not warrant contempt of court charges, even if they were made against a former chief justice.
He insisted that judges were open-minded about criticism, saying, ""Judges hold a very high position and they should welcome criticism.""
The petitioner, Khaliq, also drew the attention of the chief justice towards another case against Ansar Abbasi and others over the investigative report pending with the IHC.
 
However, Justice Minallah said it was a separate case and should not be mixed with the current one.
The IHC had on Nov 16 taken notice of the investigative report and issued show-cause notices to Ansar Abbasi, the former chief judge of GB and two others. The next hearing of the case will be held on Nov 30.",Pakistan
"Wine stores shut down in Balochistan's Gwadar district after talks with protesters
","November 26, 2021","The Excise, Taxation and Anti-Narcotics Department on Friday ordered the closure of all wine stores in Balochistan's Gwadar district with immediate effect in view of the ""law and order situation"".
The notification was shared by provincial Minister for Planning and Development Mir Zahoor Ahmed Buledi on Twitter. He said that the decision was taken after negotiations with Maulana Hidayatur Rehman Baloch, the secretary general of Jamaat-i-Islami’s Balochistan chapter, who is leading the 
.
			
On Thursday, leaders of the movement had agreed to 
 for three days their planned protest sit-in and blockade of the coastal highway and Eastbay expressway after talks with a team of provincial ministers.
Thousands of people from Gwadar, Turbat, Pishkan, Zamran, Buleda, Ormara and Pasni were taking part in the sit-in for over a week. Their demands included the removal of additional check-posts at Pushkan, Sarbandan and Gwadar City, the complete removal of fishing trawlers and the opening of the Pak-Iran border.
After the second round of talks with the government team, which was headed by Buledi, leaders of the movement had given three days' time for the acceptance of their demands.
Official sources said the provincial government had accepted four demands of the protesters and authorities concerned had issued an official notification in this regard. One of the key demands accepted by the provincial government was taking over powers of running the Pak-Iran border affairs from the Frontier Corps authorities and handing it over to the district administration.
The official notification issued by authorities concerned was handed over to leaders of the sit-in.
It was also decided that the Maritime Security Agency, the district administration and the fisheries department will conduct joint patrolling in Balochistan waters against illegal fishing of trawlers and drive foreign mafia trawlers out of waters of Gwadar district to protect the rights of Gwadar's fishermen  and other areas of Balochistan.
Speaking to protesters on Thursday, Maulana Hidayatur Rehman had said that the government officials had handed over some documents about acceptance of some demands “but we have no trust in them and have given a three-day deadline for acceptance of all demands of the people of the movement staging the sit-in”.
According to documents available with

A separate notification stated that border management would be monitored by the district administration in close consultation with ""line agencies"".

"Controversial Indian farm reforms law repealed
","November 30, 2021","NEW: Indian lawmakers on Monday repealed agricultural legislation that provoked a year of 
 from farmers, in a move that was seen as a major reversal and rare climbdown for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government, which had ardently defended the controversial reforms. 
The Farm Laws Repeal bill passed the lower and upper houses of parliament with scant debate ten days after Modi announced the surprise decision to withdraw the three laws in a televised national address. 
Protesting farmers have hunkered down in makeshift camps outside the capital of New Delhi since November of last year to demand the removal of the laws, which they fear would drastically shrink their incomes. 
The repeal bill will need to be signed by the president before it is formally implemented. But farmers last week said their demonstrations will continue. Thousands of jubilant farmers on tractors, jeeps and cars, waved green and white flags as they rode along highways ringing New Delhi to celebrate their victory, but made it clear that the government has not met all of their demands. 
Rakesh Tikait, a top farmer leader, said that they needed government assurances of guaranteed prices for certain essential crops, like wheat and rice — a system introduced in the 1960s to help India shore up its food reserves and prevent shortages. He demanded that the government set up a committee to settle these demands before the famers consider ending their protests. 
Farmers form one of India’s most influential voting blocs. Modi’s decision to scrap the new laws came ahead of elections early next year in key states like Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, both significant agricultural producers and where his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is eager to shore up its support. 
Modi’s far-right Hindu nationalist party already holds power in Uttar Pradesh, but its support is under pressure over a struggling economy and the government’s response to the pandemic. If farmers desert the ruling party, it will not only shrink prospects to form a state government for a second term but also weaken chances for the party to get an overwhelming majority in the 2024 national elections. 
Political analysts say these upcoming elections are a major reason behind the surprise move to withdraw the unpopular agricultural reforms, but that it’s too early to say whether it will work. 
The government initially insisted that the new legislation, which would open the way to a deregulated market and more private-sector control in agriculture, was urgently needed to modernise Indian farming. 
But farmers feared that the government’s move to introduce market reforms would leave workers poorer.",Newspaper
"9/11 survivors want Afghanistan’s $7bn funds in US paid as compensation
","November 30, 2021","WASHINGTON: Families of the 9/11 victims want the entire $7 billion of Afghan assets — withheld at the US Federal Reserve — paid as compensation for the terrorist attacks that killed and injured thousands, the US media reported on Monday. 
The 
 
 that the Biden administration “is scheduled to tell a federal court on Friday what outcome would be in the US national interest,” — returning the money to Kabul or distributing it among the survivors and families of the 9/11 victims. 
“The US Justice Department has been negotiating with lawyers for the 9/11 plaintiffs a potential deal to divide up the money, if the government supports their attempt to seize it,” the report added. 
“The White House National Security Council has been working with agencies across the government to weigh the proposal.” 
About 150 family members of Sept 11 victims went to the courts nearly 20 years ago to seek compensation for their losses. Almost 3,000 people were killed, and more than 5,000 were injured. The lawsuit named targets, like Al Qaeda and Taliban, who, they said, orchestrated the attack and therefore must pay the compensation as well. 
A decade later, a court found the defendants liable by default and ordered them to pay damages now worth about $7 billion. 
The judgment, however, seemed symbolic as the US invaded Afghanistan soon after the attacks, deposed the Taliban regime and decimated Al Qaeda. 
On Aug 15 this year, the Taliban returned to power and claimed that about $7 billion of the Afghan central bank, frozen at the US Federal Reserve in New York, was rightfully theirs.",Newspaper
"Women, children pour into Gwadar’s streets to demand rights
","November 30, 2021","GWADAR: A large number of women along with their children took to the streets of the port city on Monday in solidarity with the movement launched for the rights of the people of Gwadar and other areas of Makran. 
The demonstrators, including female students, political workers and working women who reached Gwadar city from Turbat, Ormara, Jewani, Pasni and other areas of Gwadar district, started their rally from Al-Johar Public School and after marching on various roads and streets reached Marine Drive.  
They kept chanting slogans against the provincial government and in support of their demands, with most of them carrying placards and banners inscribed with “Gwadar ko haq do” (Give rights to Gwadar). 
Secretary General of Jamaat-i-Islami’s (JI) Balochistan chapter Maulana Hidayatur Rehman Baloch, who has been leading the sit-in in Gwadar for the last two weeks, welcomed the women activists and stressed that such a big rally of women was proof that every person was now willing to join the movement for their rights.  
“The people of Gwadar have been deceived in the name of CPEC [China-Pakistan Economic Corridor] and Gwadar port while they have not benefited from it,” he said.  
He lamented that fishermen had been deprived of earning their livelihood, a ban was imposed on border trade and people were not getting health, education, water supply and other basic amenities. 
Maulana Baloch asserted that drug mafia was running drugs and liquor business with the connivance of the local administration due to which the youth were becoming drug addicts and the provincial government was doing nothing to abolish liquor shops and act against the drugs business.  
He said that although the government had issued a notification in this regard, its powerful institutions refused to accept the orders. 
He regretted that the protesters had been termed “Indian agents” just because they are fighting for their rights. “We are agents of our people and not the agents of an enemy country,” he said, adding that instead of punishing an Indian agent who was arrested from Balochistan, the government was making legislation for his release. 
The people, including women and children, would not step back from their demands, and the protesters would start blocking the coastal highway and other roads in the coming days, Maulana Baloch declared.  
“If CPEC and Gwadar port are not for the prosperity of the local people, then they do not need to be here,” he added. He appreciated the protest by transport companies supplying construction material to the Chinese companies and said that it was a slap on the face of those who were talking about the development of Gwadar.

"Govt mulls dividends plan to cut circular debt
","November 30, 2021","KARACHI: The government is considering a scheme to reduce the stock of the circular debt by declaring dividends for the shareholders of energy sector companies. 
The government owns major stakes in big energy companies and stands to benefit directly if they announce dividends. 
According to an official statement on Monday, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Finance and Revenue Shaukat Tarin chaired a meeting on the issue at the Finance Division. The petroleum secretary told the meeting a low pay-out ratio and a mounting circular debt have resulted in a significant drop in the share prices of energy companies on the Pakistan Stock Exchange. Poor cash flows are affecting future growth and long-term sustainability of the listed energy companies, the statement quoted him as saying. 
Mr Tarin advised the energy companies to make the “best use of their resources” and directed the Petroleum Division to present a workable plan in the next meeting. 
In the recent past, Mr Tarin has encouraged energy heavyweights to announce dividends and count the same towards settling the circular debt. 
By Mr Tarin’s own estimates, such a move would not only increase energy companies’ valuations on the stock market but also bring down the circular debt by Rs300-400 billion. The stock of unpaid bills within the energy value chain currently hovers around Rs2.5 trillion. 
For example, trade debts of Oil and Gas Development Company, one of the last entities in the circular debt chain, include an overdue amount of Rs322.4bn as receivables from oil refineries and gas companies. 
As for Pakistan Petroleum Ltd, another tail-end firm in the circular debt chain, trade debts include Rs260.2bn as receivables from state-controlled companies and Rs6.1bn from oil refineries. 
The finance adviser had made this suggestion in response to a speech by stockbroker-turned industrialist Arif Habib in a ceremony on Nov 14 in Karachi. In his speech, Mr Habib had noted that the index was trading at (2022) forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 4.9 versus the historical average of 8.1. 
An indicator of how much investors are willing to pay for each rupee in earnings, the prevailing P/E multiple suggests stock values are suppressed, particularly because of cash-flow restraints in index heavyweight energy companies. 
Mentioning the benefits of announcing dividends and adjusting them against the outstanding circular debt, Mr Tarin also referred to the global depositary receipts or GDRs, which are instruments to raise capital by listing local companies on foreign stock exchanges. Declaring dividends will improve valuations of energy companies and enable the government to raise funds internationally by issuing GDRs, he had said. 
 adds: Meanwhile, in a meeting with a delegation of Pakistan Sugar Mills Association (PSMA) on Monday, Mr Tarin said the government appreciated the critical role of the sugar industry in the country’s economic progress and would resolve its problems on a priority basis. 
He listened to all delegation members keenly and issued orders for the resolution of their problems. 
The PSMA delegation apprised the meeting of the issues facing the sugar industry. Mr Tarin reiterated the government’s commitment to address genuine concerns of the industry.",Newspaper

Oceania does not have an automatic place at the finals. 
New Zealand were the last country from the region to qualify for the World Cup when they appeared in South Africa in 2010. They missed out on a place in Russia in 2018 after losing to Peru in a playoff.

The group phase draw was due to take place later on Monday. 
American Samoa and Samoa withdrew due to Covid-19 travel restrictions. 
Teams will be drawn into two groups of four with the top two advancing to the semi-finals at the end of the single round-robin phase. 
FIFA have granted the Oceania Football Confed­eration a one-day extension to the March international window, which is due to run from March 21-29, to allow teams to call up overseas-based players from the final round of group matches onwards.

The 36-year-old Philander, who joined the Pakistan team for the ICC T20  World Cup was scheduled to leave for South Africa after the ongoing first Test against Bangladesh in Chittagong. But due to latest virus-related developments back in his country, flights from and to South Africa are being suspended. Therefore, the former paceman is making an early return.
As the PCB did not appoint coaches on regular basis after the resignations of Misbah-ul-Haq (head coach) and Waqar Younis (coach) last September, Philander and batting coach former Australia opener Matthew Hayden were hired in an interim arrangement.  Left-handed Hayden left the Pakistan squad soon after the T20 World Cup ended in the UAE on Nov 14.
After the resignations of Misbah and Waqar, the PCB has not yet started the process to hire permanent coaches. Therefore, current interim head coach Saqlain Mushtaq is most likely to continue to perform his duty for next month’s white-ball home series against the West Indies comprising three ODIs and as many T20 Internationals.

"PPP defiant as Peshawar administration denies public meeting permission
","November 30, 2021","PESHAWAR: The opposition Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) is set to stage a power show in Peshawar on its foundation day today (Tuesday) despite the deputy commissioner’s refusal to allow it to hold a public meeting.
Accompanied by Sindh information minister Saeed Ghani during a news conference here on Monday, PPP secretary general Nayyar Hussain Bukhari blasted the DC for not giving permission to the party to mark its 54th foundation day.
Party chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and senior leaders will attend the event.
“This is our fundamental right to mark the party’s foundation day,” Mr Bukhari said, adding that the DC had permitted the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf to hold a public meeting in the same area a few days ago.
“If the PTI can hold the public meeting, then what is wrong with the PPP?”
The PPP leader said the Peshawar DC was the state’s servant and not a particular party’s.
He said the local party leadership had sought permission for the foundation day public meeting but the DC denied it.
“The party regularly organises the foundation day function in every unit of the federation,” he said.
The DC, according to the official letter, declined to entertain the request of the PPP to hold the public meeting for two reasons.
“In light of the ongoing local government elections 2021 and as per the code of conduct issued by the Election Commission of Pakistan for political parties, contesting candidates, election agents through a letter, your (PPP provincial information secretary) application cannot be entertained. Secondly, keeping in view the security situation, your application is regretted,” he said. Despite the permission denial, the party kept setting up the public meeting stage at Patang Chowk on the Ring Road. Also, its leadership cut the cake there in the evening.
On the occasion, Mr Ghani lashed out at the federal government for its ‘antagonistic attitude’ towards the Sindh government.
He termed Prime Minister Imran Khan “the most ill-informed” head of the government and said the federal government should not blame the Sindh government for the shortage of wheat, sugar, gas, and other essential commodities.
The Sindh minister said the shortage of fertiliser on the market was brewing and the farmers had to pay more, but the federal government would again blame the Sindh government for crises.
He claimed that the PPP was gaining popularity in Karachi and its vote bank was increasing.
Regarding unauthorised construction in Karachi, Mr Ghani said a commission had been constituted to regularise 6,000 illegal housing societies in Punjab and the same decision should be applied to Sindh.
He said the issue of unauthorised construction existed across the country, including Islamabad.
“The Supreme Court had imposed Rs1.8 million fine for unauthorised construction of a huge building on the Constitution Avenue in Islamabad but regularised the structure. The same criteria should be applied to Sindh as well,” he said.
Meanwhile, PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari said after a long struggle and unprecedented sacrifices, only his party could ‘pave the way’ for democracy in Pakistan.
In a statement issued by the party’s Media Cell here ahead of the foundation day, the PPP chairman said only his party’s manifesto and strategy could make the court a truly democratic and welfare state.
“The PPP is a revolutionary movement based on the ideology of Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the philosophy of Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, and the struggles and sacrifices of many generations. Even in face of the most difficult circumstances, the PPP gave the country and the nation a rich strategic gift, including the country’s first unified Constitution, nuclear programme guaranteeing invincible defence and missile technology, provincial sovereignty, and agrarian and economic reforms,” he said.
Mr Bilawal said the PPP had also made Pakistan the hub of Islamic world and strengthened the Pakistan-China friendship.
“Today, I salute all jiyalas [workers], who sacrificed their lives for the cause of democracy, endured the hardships of imprisonment, deportation, and undemocratic forces, and also faced sponsored media trials,” he said.",Pakistan
"The fuss about ‘reunification’
","November 30, 2021","PAKISTAN’S Foreign Office offered what sounded like a 
 to the routinely chest-thumping comments by Mohan Bhagwat, the head of India’s right-wing Hindu RSS. He had, not for the first time, spoken of the need to undo the 1947 partition.
The fact is that the RSS rallies its cadres with the dream of ‘Akhand Bharat’ — a Sanskritised India constructed on mythology rather than history. Its ambitious map stretches from current Afghanistan to Myanmar. The drawing represents Hindutva’s wishful thinking and, naturally, locates Bangladesh and Pakistan within its boundaries together with the entire erstwhile Jammu and Kashmir, including the China-administered Aksai Chin.
 
There are quiet (and yet firm) ways to deal with such occasional neighbourly irritants. During the debate to dismantle Jammu and Kashmir in August 2019, Home Minister Amit Shah threatened to take back Aksai Chin from China. A short low-decibel Chinese response was all it took for the topic to never resurface again, by anyone in the Indian government.
The notion of ‘Akhand Bharat’ involving Pakistan is a soufflé that refuses to rise. Former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee neatly trashed it. The significance of Vajpayee’s visit to Minar-i-Pakistan in Lahore in 1999 lay in the fact that a pro-Hindutva leader for the first time showed respect to the venue where the Pakistan resolution was passed in 1940. The visit implied a distancing from the calls for Akhand Bharat — for it needlessly, for transient political purposes, appeared to threaten to breach Pakistan’s sovereignty.
Vajpayee’s visit, foolishly opposed by Jamaat-i-Islami activists in Lahore, helped dampen the notion of the puerile RSS map in public discussion. Subsequently, the visit to Jinnah’s mausoleum by Vajpayee’s more right-wing colleague L.K. Advani further sealed the fate of the Pakistan-baiters. The world saw Advani heaping praise on Pakistan’s founder, possibly with the knowledge that the lavish comments ran against the grain of his political schooling with the RSS. Advani’s fall from grace within the Hindutva fold commenced with that visit.
The arrival of a more loose-mouthed establishment since 2014 may have uncorked the stifled discussion once again but few would take it seriously. The farmers and civil society are 
 that matter anyway. Therefore, why lose composure over meaningless comments, more so if they haven’t come from a responsible official?
A laughable parallel would be that of some Muslim revivalist group in Pakistan dreaming of the return of Mughal rule in India. This is not to say that cataclysmic things don’t happen in a very fragile world. Its own president dissolved the formidable Soviet Union. Pakistan claims a moral stake in uniting with Kashmiris in the Valley. But it opposes Tamils in Sri Lanka from seeking a separate homeland. Elsewhere, key adjuncts of sovereign nations have threatened to walk out of the fold in the UK and Canada, but without excessive rancour.
The Pakistan Foreign Office’s comments in response to an irritating habit from a section of Indians were not dissimilar to fears expressed from Karachi (the capital then) that Nehru noted with empathy. In one of his last interviews, Nehru is quoted in Gunnar Myrdal’s Asian Drama, as saying that he would have liked a loose confederation with Pakistan. “But if we talk about it, they tend to take it amiss.” This is not to say that the RSS chief was speaking in Nehru’s language, far from it. The RSS can’t see India without right-wing Hindu hegemony.
The idea of Europe-like open borders between India and Pakistan is a dream that thousands of ordinary and well-meaning Indians and Pakistanis dream, however. They are tired of their untenable military budgets, avoidable hostilities and the terrible consequences they heap upon their people. The fact is that Bhagwat and his ilk despise Nehru. They aim to dismantle the edifice of a secular, caring republic Nehru strove to build in India, not different to what Zia did with Jinnah’s dream.
It was Constitution Day in India on Nov 26. This day in 1949 the Dalit lawyer B.R. Ambedkar presented the finished draft charter to the assembly. Two months later, the constitution was adopted and the day declared Republic Day. Nehru had taken Ambedkar’s vision into account, and he made this known to the constituent assembly in January 1947.
“The first task of this Assembly is to free India through a new constitution, to feed the starving people, and to clothe the naked masses, and to give every Indian the fullest opportunity to develop himself according to his capacity. This is certainly a great task. Look at India today … The atmosphere is surcharged with these quarrels and feuds, which are called communal disturbances, and unfortunately we sometimes cannot avoid them. But at present the greatest and most important question in India is how to solve the problem of the poor and the starving. Wherever we turn, we are confronted with this problem. If we cannot solve this problem soon, all our paper constitutions will become useless and purposeless.”
This promise of democracy, justice, egalitarianism and rule of law the RSS pooh-poohed. Through its English mouthpiece, Organiser, it said on Nov 30, 1949: “But in our constitution, there is no mention of the unique constitutional development in ancient Bharat. Manu’s laws were written long before Lycurgus of Sparta or Solon of (Athens). To this day, his laws as enunciated in the Manusmriti excite the admiration of the world and elicit spontaneous obedience and conformity. But to our constitutional pundits that means nothing.”
Critics of the RSS say Manu’s laws are primarily violent edicts targeting women and Dalits. The RSS might do better than that to win the affection of a wary neighbourhood. Equally, even Nehru’s ruminations could become a menace to citizens in both countries if they weren’t first conceived in democracy, one especially underpinned by equal rights for women and minorities on both sides.",Newspaper
"Culture of pressuring courts through phone calls should now end, says Bilawal
","November 30, 2021","PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Tuesday said that the ""culture of pressuring courts over phone calls"" to rein in political leaders should now end, saying that courts and parliament must take measures to end this practice once and for all.
""We are not happy at all that audio tapes are emerging against those who would threaten and pressure courts over phone calls to hand sentences of 20 years' [imprisonment] to Shaheed Bibi and Zardari and to seize their family property,"" Bilawal told a rally in Peshawar.
""We think the system of making phone calls is wrong today and was wrong then and in the future, no one should have the courage to make such an attempt.""
The PPP leader said ""Imran must realise the gravity of the situation and stop practising undemocratic politics, otherwise, he will suffer the same fate as that of his predecessors.""
The PPP chief than moved on to criticising the government for inflation in the country. Annual consumer price inflation rate in the country rose to 11.5 per cent in November, the Pakistan Bureau of  Statistics said on Tuesday.
That was up from 9.2pc the previous month as the government and central bank struggle with high inflation. The State Bank of Pakistan this month lifted rates by 150 basis points, in part due to surging price growth.
Bilawal claimed the people of Peshawar would hold the PTI accountable in upcoming local government elections, adding that the PPP would stand with the inflation-hit masses in taking ""revenge"" from the incumbent government.
""Prices of basic commodities increased manifold in recent months just because of a lack of planning and vision,"" the PPP chairman said.
Talking about the recent bill passed to allow voting rights for overseas Pakistanis, Bilawal said Pakistani nationals based abroad should have a separate electoral college. ""How could it be possible that a person casts vote in Paris and it is part of the result in Bannu.""
He alleged that Imran was trying to bring votes from ""outside"" to strengthen his voter base. 
""We are going to challenge this rule in courts and also highlight this conspiracy in street protests,"" Bilawal said.
Referring indirectly to the government's olive branch to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban, Bilawal said the prime minister had ""bowed down before terrorists"" without taking families of APS martyrs and the parliament into confidence. 
He said the government must first press those asking for the imposition of Shariah in the country to respect the Constitution of Pakistan. ""We will not accept any of your talks until terrorists involved in serious cases face trial and get punishment,"" he added.
Bilawal said Islam didn't allow the killing of children and women, emphasising that ""the killers of our people should first face retribution before any other measure.""
Calling the government ""incompetent and failed"", he claimed the incumbent rulers were playing with the fate of Pakistan.",Pakistan

"Laos opens $6bn Chinese-built railway line
","December 4, 2021","BANGKOK: A sleek red, blue and white bullet train departed a new Vientiane station on Friday, signalling the opening of Laos’ $6 billion Chinese-built railway. 
The 414-kilometre route took five years to construct under China’s trillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative. 
Laos President Thongloun Sisoulith heralded a “new era of modern infrastructure development” for his country. 
“I am proud that the dreams of Lao people have come true,” he said at the opening ceremony on Friday afternoon. 
The railway will connect the Chinese city of Kunming to the Laotian capital Vientiane, with grand plans for high-speed rail to ultimately snake down through Thailand and Malaysia to Singapore. 
Analysts have acknowledged a potential economic lift, but have asked how infrastructure-poor Laos will pay its $1.06 billion debt liability and whether it is ready to exploit the state-of-the-art transport system. 
The Laos government also took out a $480 million loan from the Export-Import Bank of China to cover two-thirds of its equity stake, bringing its total share of debt to $1.54bn. 
Scores of dignitaries in Vientiane waited on the red carpet waving flags at the launch ceremony before some, including Prime Minister Phankham Viphavanh, clambered aboard for a train trip to Vang Vieng — the adventure capital. 
At the same time a green train left Kunming station for the maiden journey to Laos. 
Chinese President Xi Jinping beamed in for the ceremony to extend his congratulations. 
“(We must) ensure the railway’s continued operation and maintenance as well as guarantee its safety, in order to build a high-quality, sustainable economic belt that benefits people’s livelihoods along the way,” he said. 
Laos, a communist-run country of 7.2 million people, previously had only four kilometres of railway tracks. 
The trains will speed along the new line at up to 160kmh, passing through 75 tunnels and across 167 bridges, stopping at 10 passenger stations. 
Passenger services are expected to begin on Saturday, state media reported, although only for those fully vaccinated against Covid. 
Four passenger services and 14 freight trips will operate daily, local media reported. 
A Buddhist ceremony was held on Thursday to bless the new railway, with Viphavanh banging a gong nine times to bring good luck, the Laotian Times reported. 
Laos took a battering in the pandemic with economic growth declining to 0.4 per cent in 2020, the lowest level in three decades, according to the World Bank. 
Hopes for a 2021 rebound were dashed when the country locked down as it registered more than 76,000 infections in the past eight months. 
The railway could boost Laos’ economy, but the government needed to undertake substantial reforms — including improving its border management systems, a World Bank report noted. 
But the project could be an economic “game changer”, according to Bangkok Bank chief economist Burin Adulwattana. 
“I don’t look at it as China trying to bankrupt Laos... it’s not a Trojan Horse strategy. I think it’s going to be a win-win situation,” he said. 
But there is little transparency around how Laos will fund its debt, Australian National University lecturer Greg Raymond said. 
A World Bank report noted “funding of the existing public infrastructure programme looks increasingly unsustainable”.",Newspaper

"Stocks close flat on late selling amid a jittery rupee
","December 4, 2021","KARACHI: Trading remained volatile on Friday owing to the concerns about alarming trade data, depreciation in the rupee and a big jump in the cut-off yields of treasury bills that indicated a hawkish stance in the upcoming monetary policy.

"UAE places biggest order for French warplanes
","December 4, 2021","DUBAI: The United Arab Emirates signed a record 14-billion-euro contract for 80 Rafale warplanes and committed billions of euros in other deals as French President Emmanuel Macron kicked off a Gulf tour on Friday.
The biggest international order ever made for the French jets came as Macron held talks with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed at the start of a two-day trip which will also take in Qatar and Saudi Arabia.
The resource-rich UAE, one of the French defence industry’s biggest customers, also inked an order for 12 Caracal military transport helicopters for a total bill of more than 17 billion euros.
“French engagement in the region, active cooperation in the fight against terrorism and the clear positions we have taken have allowed us to grow closer with the United Arab Emirates,” Macron told journalists in Dubai.
“And at a time when questions are being asked about other long-term partners, I think this reinforces the position of France,” he added, describing France as a “solid” and “trustworthy” ally that “sticks to its commitments”.
Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala sovereign wealth fund also pledged eight billion euros in investments in French businesses, while the licence of the UAE capital’s branch of the Louvre art gallery was extended for 10 years to 2047.
The Emirates was the fifth biggest customer for the French defence industry with 4.7 billion euros from 2011-2020, according to a parliamentary report.
France has faced criticism after some of these weapons were used during the UAE’s engagement in Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition is fighting Iran-backed rebels in a war that has created one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises.
The Rafale order, signed on Friday while Macron met with Sheikh Mohammed at Dubai’s Expo site, is the biggest made internationally for the Dassault Aviation aircraft since it entered service in 2004.
It follows the collapse of a multibillion-dollar submarine deal with Australia in September that left Paris fuming after Canberra negotiated a new defence pact with London and Washington.
French Defence Minister Florence Parly called it a “historic contract” which will contribute “directly to regional stability”. The F4 model Rafales, currently under development, will be delivered from 2027.
“This is an outcome of the strategic partnership between the two countries, consolidating their capacity to act together for their autonomy and security,” the French presidency said in a statement.
By snapping up the fighter aircraft the UAE is eclipsing the fleets of Gulf rival Qatar, which has bought 36 of the planes, and Egypt which ordered 24 in 2015 and 30 earlier this year.",Newspaper
"‘Lot of concern’ over Russian military activity near Ukraine: US general
","December 4, 2021","WASHINGTON: The United States is tracking enough indicators and warnings surrounding Russian military activity near Ukraine to trigger “a lot of concern” and Russian rhetoric appears increasingly strident, the top US military officer said late on Thursday.
Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, declined to speculate about the kinds of options the United States might consider in the event of a Russian invasion. But Milley, in some of his most extensive remarks on the crisis, stressed the importance of Ukraine’s sovereignty to Washington and to the Nato alliance.
“There’s significant national security interests of the United States and of Nato member states at stake here if there was an overt act of aggressive action militarily by the Russians into a nation state that has been independent since 1991,” Milley said during a flight from Seoul to Washington.
Ukraine says Russia has amassed more than 90,000 troops near their long shared border. But Moscow has dismissed suggestions it is preparing for an attack on its southern neighbor and has defended its right to deploy troops on its own territory as it sees fit.
The Kremlin already annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and then backed rebels fighting Kyiv government forces in the east of the country. That conflict has killed 14,000 people, Kyiv says, and is still simmering.
Experts caution that an unchallenged Russian invasion could be destabilizing, creating ripple effects well beyond Ukraine at a time of increasing anxiety over Chinese intentions toward Taiwan.
Milley declined to state publicly his estimate of the number of Russian forces near Ukraine but suggested his concerns went beyond the raw numbers of Russian troops.
“I’m not going to tell you what we track and the indicators or warnings from an intelligence standpoint, but we track them all,” Milley said. “And there’s enough out there now to cause a lot of concern, and we’ll continue to monitor.” Russia and Ukraine have centuries of shared history and formed the two biggest republics of the Soviet Union until its 1991 collapse, so Moscow views its neighbor’s ambition to join Nato as an affront and a threat.
Since the latest crisis started, Moscow has set out demands for legally binding security guarantees from the West, and for assurances that Nato will not admit Ukraine as a member or deploy missile systems there to target Russia.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Moscow on Thursday of “severe costs” if it invaded Ukraine, urging his Russian counterpart to seek a diplomatic exit from the crisis.
Milley declined to speculate whether Russian President Vladimir Putin might be emboldened by US President Joe Biden’s withdrawal from Afghanistan, saying “You’d have to ask Putin.” The August pullout ended America’s two-decade-old war in an unambiguous defeat, with the Taliban returning to power.
“I think it would be a mistake for any country to draw a broad strategic conclusion based on the US withdrawal from Afghanistan and then take that event and automatically apply it to other situations,” Milley said.
He cited historic examples of past US presidents who withdrew troops in some places but ordered military action elsewhere.
“So the United States is a difficult country for other countries to understand sometimes,” he said.",Newspaper

Federal Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Asad Umar chaired a meeting in Islamabad to review the progress of the mega project, which had recently been taken over by the federal government from the Sindh government.
Additional secretary-development Abdul Aziz Uqaili, project director Amir Mughal, and project consultants Dr Bashir Lakhani and senior officials attended the meeting.
“The project director briefed the minister about the revised PC-1 of the K-IV project, its components, and design details,” said a statement issued after the meeting.
“It was informed in the meeting that Wapda has completed the revised design of 650 MGD K-IV to be executed in phases. All planning, design, and procurement activities are as per the project timeline, and the construction of this project will be completed by October 2023,” it added.
The federal minister also advised the officials to ensure uninterrupted power supply to operate pumping stations and to supply water to the proposed reservoirs.
The project director informed him that the design of the K-IV project had been developed with a modular approach in which five pumping stations with as many large mild steel pipes of 84 inches each carrying 130 MGD with a total capacity of 650 MGD had been planned to be executed.
The meeting was informed that Wapda has submitted PC-1 with a modified design of 650 MGD K-IV Project with various options for execution of the project, which can be done in phases.
Mr Umar directed the Planning Division to expedite processing of the revised PC-1 to get it approved as early as possible from Central Development Working Party (CDWP) and Executive Committee of National Economic Council (Ecnec).
The minister expressed satisfaction over the pace of the progress and work on the development of revised planning and design of this project which is in line with the prime minister’s commitment to ensuring water availability to residents of Karachi.
Last month, Wapda chairman retired Lt Gen Muzammil Hussain had visited the project site.
The multibillion-rupee scheme was meant to meet the water needs of Karachiites but it remains a distant dream even after more than 10 years of its formal launch in 2011.

"Senate body concerned over biometric issues faced by Ehsaas, BISP beneficiaries
","December 4, 2021","ISLAMABAD: A parliamentary committee on Friday voiced concern over the biometric verifications in the government’s Ehsaas Emergency Cash Programme and Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) which in some cases were unable to be established due to age and occupation.
Detailed briefings on the programmes were the top agenda item of the Senate Standing Committee on Poverty Alleviation and Social Safety, which met with Senator Naseebullah Bazai in the chair.
Senior officers from the Ministry of Poverty Alleviation and Social Safety Division along with Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Poverty Alleviation and Social Protection Dr Sania Nishtar briefed the members.
The meeting was informed that the objective of these programmes was to address on-ground core issues related to human development. While members showed concerns over the biometric verifications, which in some cases were unable to be established due to age and occupation, they were assured that maximum efforts were being made to address them and ensure ease of operations. It was also revealed that less than seven per cent of the beneficiaries faced such a problem and they were given 16 attempts before being referred back. The transactions for such cases were routed through banks. Keeping in view similar issues a long-term plan was being formulated.
Regarding disbursement of funds, the committee was informed that initially the NFC formula was being used. However, now disbursements were made on account of the poverty index as per data of the national socioeconomic survey.
Regarding federal and provincial share in the budget, the committee was informed that the federal government had allocated 35pc for the programme and 65pc was to be shouldered by provinces.
In case of filters and risk of exclusion of the deserving, the committee was informed that since funds were limited screening was mandatory to ensure that those who were most in need were not left out. Filters had been relaxed for the Ehsaas ration programme for which registrations were ongoing.
The members were informed that the Ehsaas Kifalat Programme of BISP was initiated in 2008. Currently, a beneficiary is being paid Rs2,000 a month. The target is to enhance the number of beneficiaries to eight million by 2022. An amount of Rs1,104 billion had been disbursed since the inception of the programme.
The Ehsaas Taleemi Wazaif Programme was introduced to encourage enrolment and control dropout rates amongst disadvantaged communities.
Children of active Ehsaas Kifalat Programme beneficiaries were eligible and given Rs2,500 for boys and Rs3,000 for girls. Disbursement of Rs19.38 billion to Rs4.15 million children has been made thus far.
The Ehsaas Nashonuma Programme had been introduced to tackle malnutrition in children. All Kifalat Programme beneficiaries with children from six to 23 months were benefitting from unconditional cash transfers. The programme was operational in 14 districts.
The Ehsaas Undergraduate Scholarship Programme envisaged providing merit and need-based scholarships over 4-5 years of undergraduate education. It comprised tuition fees and stipend to cover living costs. About 50pc of these scholarships are reserved for women while the Higher Education Commission (HEC) was the executing agency of the programme.
The committee was informed about the upgradation of all field offices to Ehsaas one-window programme to enable delivery of the multiple Ehsaas programmes through one-window approach. An estimated 469 Ehsaas one-window centres would be established across the country. The members were invited to visit one such centre in Islamabad.",Pakistan
"Peshawar High Court seeks govt response to plea against Citizenship Act
","December 4, 2021","PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court has admitted to full hearing a petition against the Citizenship Act’s provision, which allows the country’s citizenship for the foreign wives of Pakistani men and not the foreign husbands of Pakistani women.
A bench consisting of Justice Lal Jan Khattak and Justice Mussarat Hilali issued notices to the attorney general for Pakistan and interior minister to file response to the petition of Pakistani woman Sameena Roohi, who sought orders for the government to grant Pakistani citizenship to her Afghan husband, Naseer Mohammad.
She claimed that the law discriminated against Pakistani women.
The petitioner requested the court to declare unconstitutional and discriminatory Section 10(2) of the Pakistan Citizenship Act, 1951, under which the wife of a Pakistani national is entitled to the country’s citizenship, but the same is denied to the foreign husband of a Pakistani woman.
She sought orders to declare that Section 10(2) of the Citizenship Act was not brought in conformity with the fundamental rights within two years of the commencement of the Constitution, which was a mandatory requirement under Article 8(4) of the Constitution.
The petitioner’s counsel, Saifullah Muhib Kakakhel, contended that Section 10(2) of the law was discriminatory and didn’t treat men and women equally.
He said his client belonged to a respectable family, was married to an Afghan national, Naseer Mohammad, in 1985, and had five children from the marriage, who all were Pakistani nationals.
The lawyer said the petitioner’s husband had been working in Kuwait for a long time and he had only been granted Pakistani visa for a short period of one month or so to visit his family.
He said that the woman’s husband had not been given an appointment in Kuwait for visa due to Covid-19 pandemic, so he could not visit his family.
Mr Kakakhel contended that the petitioner had visited the Nadra and immigration offices to seek citizenship for her husband, but was told that Section 10(2) of the law applied only to the foreign wife of a Pakistani citizen.
He contended that the Federal Shariat Court had declared in 2008 the impugned provision repugnant to the injunctions of the Holy Quran and Sunnah, and called it discriminatory, against gender equality, and a violation of articles 2(a) and 25 of the Constitution.
The counsel argued that Pakistan was home to millions of refugees from Afghanistan, who shared the same culture and language, and a large number of them had contracted marriages with Pakistanis especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, but only the spouses of men are granted nationality of Pakistan and Pakistani women were deprived of the same.
He referred to several international conventions to which Pakistan is a signatory, including Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and said by not amending the Citizenship Act, the government had been violating all those international laws, which declared that there should be no discrimination on basis of gender.
The respondents in the petition are Nadra through its director-general, interior ministry through its secretary, and directorate-general of immigration and passport through it director-general.",Pakistan
"The mutawwa are coming
","December 4, 2021","‘MUTAWWA’ is Arabic for the once-feared Saudi religious police. Tasked to implement behavioural standards set by oil-fuelled Wahabism, its wings have been clipped by the ongoing liberalisation sweeping the Middle East. But, under Imran Khan, Pakistan is flying elsewhere. To 
 the government’s new Single National Curriculum (SNC), strict religious policing of public and private schools has begun. A Pakistani version of the mutawwa is emerging.
Marked as ‘Court Case — Most Important’, in a letter dated Nov 10, 2021, the School Education Department of the Punjab Government issued a 
 that, as per orders received from the Lahore High Court, all schools in the province must be rigorously checked for Quranic reading/nazra skills. Each school will be jointly inspected by the head of the district education authority and a district & sessions judge. Cellphone numbers of school principals and teachers, together with a list of several hundred schools targeted for inspection, have been provided.
Reading the Quran under a maulvi’s supervision has been a normal, age-old practice in every Muslim household — including that of the writer. But dispatching law-enforcers to enforce a tradition is new and bizarre. Preliminary reports suggest province-wide confusion and chaos, and a state of fear among children, teachers, and school principals. 
Magistrates accompanied by rifle-bearing policemen are pouncing upon schools, interrogating seven- to 12-year-old children. Their teachers are ordered out of the classroom or asked to stand silently in the corner. In some cases, school principals have been told to present themselves in person before authorities located in various parts of the province.
Punishments are being handed out. Last week, a sessions judge in Nankana Sahib recommended disciplinary action against three school principals. They were accused of paying insufficient attention to Quran teaching as a separate subject, a requirement of the SNC. Included in the charge sheet is that their schools had “students who had Paras of the Holy Quran and were keeping them in their school bags which is gross negligence”.
This needs explanation. As the reader may know, no copy of the Quran can be kept together with ordinary books. Visiting magistrates accuse children of bringing Quran copies from home inside their backpacks together with their textbooks. But what else can the kids do? Carry two backpacks? Rudimentary schools, such as they exist in villages or poor urban areas, have barely enough sitting room and no storage space. Cupboards, if any, are few while those with locks are still fewer.  
Magistrates have also noted that backpacks are thrown around or placed on the floor. According to a school principal in his school at least four accidental drops of the holy book have occurred in a sixth grade class. While these caused a stir subsequent developments could not be known. The severity of punishments — which could possibly include those for blasphemy — means that such incidents are generally hushed up unless they are to be wilfully used against rivals. 
These are not the only matters that school principals and teachers are worried about. Traditional respect requires that none can turn his/her back to the Quran. What is one to do in a classroom packed with kids? As for wuzu: a majority of schools have no proper toilets or clean water but, as is well known, none may touch the Quran without being properly cleansed. 
Using a disguised identity, a female teacher wrote that proper cleansing is particularly problematic for female schools — and even more for mixed schools. As per normal requirement no girl, or teacher, may touch the holy book while menstruating. But the topic is so tabooed that none dare mention it in front of students or higher ups. Could this — rather than laziness — be why some female Quran schoolteachers were unable to explain to the inspection teams their absence from class?
Paradoxically, the squads going from school to school across Punjab are meant to check Quran-teaching standards but their own members are deficient in an important way. SNC prescribes Quran teaching with proper tajweed (pronunciation) of Arabic words. However, this is beyond the capacity of most Quran schoolteachers in the area because they are rarely able to pronounce the letters ‘Qaf’ and ‘A’in’ as in Arabic. 
Exceptions are madressah graduates who spend their lives honing the skill of accurate recitation. Thus, if the tajweed requirement is to be fulfilled, logically such persons will have to be inducted as regular teachers. This runs counter to emphatic denials made by the education minister, Shafqat Mahmood, who claims that the existing school system is not being madressah-ised.
What drove the Lahore High Court to issue its orders so speedily? What was the urgency given a thousand other pending complaints concerning property disputes, theft, fraud, child abuse, rape, and murder? The answer is before us: ideologues in government have seized the reins of power. As in Afghanistan, the population is now at their mercy. 
It was not supposed to be this way. Recall that Imran Khan’s SNC was initially advertised as means towards equal opportunities for the rich and poor, regular schools and madressahs. And — this is the most unbelievable part — also about raising the quality of education. So, are we about to see magistrates with armed guards inspecting school laboratories and frequency of science practicals? Checking if libraries are adequately stocked or that toilets are in working condition? Will these squads tell 25 million out-of-school children where to find schools and teachers? Hell is likely to freeze over before that happens. 
The fortunate among us will recall school days as being carefree and filled with joy, laughter, and play. This is how it is in much of the world, and this is what every child should have. Afghanistan’s children are not so fortunate and now the children of Naya Pakistan are beset with similar misfortune. 
Grim-faced magistrates swooping down upon schools, destroying the authority of teachers and school principals, and putting terror into the hearts of all is a disgrace to the notion of education. It may not end here. How we dress, speak, and think is going to be increasingly policed. Imran Khan’s Pakistan is racing down the path to Talibanisation.",Pakistan
"'Good news': Shaukat Tarin confirms SBP's receipt of $3bn deposit from Saudi Arabia
","December 4, 2021","Adviser to the Prime Minister on Finance and Revenue Shaukat Tarin announced on Saturday that the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) had received Saudi Arabia's

""Good news, $3bn Saudi deposit received by SBP. I want to thank His Excellency Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman and [the] kingdom of Saudi Arabia for the kind gesture,"" the adviser tweeted. 
			
The agreement was reached during Prime Minister Imran Khan's

"Bitcoin falls by a fifth, cryptos see $1bn worth liquidated
","December 4, 2021","Bitcoin shed a fifth of its value on Saturday as a combination of profit-taking and macro-economic concerns triggered nearly a billion dollars worth of selling across cryptocurrencies.
Bitcoin was 12 per cent down at 0920 GMT at $47,495. It fell as low as $41,967.5 during the session, taking total losses for the day to 22pc.
The broad selloff in cryptocurrencies also saw Ether, the coin linked to the ethereum blockchain network, plunge more than 10pc.
Based on cryptocurrency data platform Coingecko, the market capitalisation of the 11,392 coins it tracks dropped nearly 15pc to $2.34 trillion. That value had briefly crossed $3tn last month when Bitcoin hit a record $69,000.
The plunge follows a volatile week for financial markets. Global equities and benchmark US bond yields tumbled on Friday after data showed US job growth slowed in November and the 
 of the coronavirus kept investors on edge. 
Justin d'Anethan, Hong Kong-based head of exchange sales at cryptocurrency exchange EQONEX, said he had been watching the increase in leverage ratios across the cryptocurrency markets as well as how large holders had been moving their coins from wallets to exchanges. The latter is usually a sign of intent to sell.
""Whales in the crypto space seem to have transferred coins to trading venue, taken advantage of a bullish bias and leverage from retail traders, to then push prices down,"" he said.
The selloff also comes ahead of testimony by executives from eight major cryptocurrency firms, including Coinbase Global CFO Alesia Haas and FTX Trading CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, before the US House Financial Services Committee on December 8. 
The hearing marks the first time major players in the crypto markets will testify before US lawmakers, as policymakers grapple with the implications of cryptocurrencies and how to best regulate them.
Last week, the US Securities and Exchange Commission rejected a second spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded fund proposal from WisdomTree.
Data from another platform Coinglass showed nearly $1bn worth of cryptocurrencies had been liquidated over the past 24 hours, with the bulk being on digital exchange Bitfinex.
""If anything, this is the opportunity to buy the dip for many investors who might have previously felt like they missed the boat. We can see tether bought at a premium, suggesting people are getting cash ready, within the crypto space, to do just that,"" D'Anethan said, referring to the biggest stablecoin in the cryptocurrency world.
A plunge in Bitcoin funding rates — the cost of holding Bitcoin via perpetual futures which peaked at 0.06pc in October — also showed traders had turned bearish.
The funding rate on cryptocurrency trading platform BitMEX fell to a negative 0.18pc from levels of 0.01pc for most of November.",World
"Taliban welcome Pakistan's decision to allow use of Afghan trucks for transport of Indian wheat
","December 4, 2021","Afghanistan welcomed on Saturday Islamabad's decision to allow the use of Afghan trucks for transporting Indian wheat  to the war-torn country after crossing into Pakistan via Wagah border in Punjab and travelling to Torkham in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which borders the Afghan province of Nangarhar.
The decision was 
 by the Foreign Office on Friday and was taken to further facilitate Pakistan’s decision to allow the transport of 50,000 metric tonnes of wheat and lifesaving medicines from India to Afghanistan on an exceptional basis for humanitarian purposes.
Pakistan's Ambassador to Afghanistan Mansoor Ahmad Khan informed Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi of the decision during a meeting with him on Saturday.
			
Later, Afghan foreign ministry spokesperson Abdul Qahar Balkhi tweeted that the meeting focused on enhancing ""trade and facilitating [the transport] of Indian-assisted wheat to ... Afghanistan"". He said Muttaqi had thanked Pakistan for allowing the use of Afghan-owned vehicles for transporting the wheat.
			
Earlier in October this year, an Indian delegation had met leaders from the Taliban government in Afghanistan on the sidelines of 
 in Russia and asked them to request Islamabad to allow the passage of Indian wheat to Afghanistan through the land route in Pakistan.
Muttaqqi had then raised the issue during his 
 to Islamabad in November and Prime Minister Imran Khan had assured him that Islamabad would ""favourably"" consider the request.
Sources in Kabul told 
 that during the Afghan foreign minister's visit, Pakistan had conveyed to him its formal decision to allow the transportation of the Indian wheat through Wagah border as per modalities to be agreed in coordination with the UN's World Food Programme (WFP).
The decision was shared with the Indian side. Evidently, Pakistan’s decision regarding modalities excluded the possibility of the transportation of wheat through Indian trucks, according to the sources.
However, a formal announcement was only made earlier this month, after Prime Minister Imran 
 for wheat transportation in consultation with the federal cabinet.
According to a statement by the Foreign Office in Islamabad, the decision was conveyed to the Indian charge d’ affaires on Friday at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Indian government was also urged to proceed quickly towards taking necessary steps for expeditiously undertaking the delivery of the humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan, according to the statement.
“This demonstrates the commitment and seriousness of the Government of Pakistan to facilitate the proposed humanitarian assistance,” the statement further said.  ",World
"FBR puts off new property valuations till Jan 16
","December 8, 2021","ISLAMABAD: To bring an end to the ongoing controversy over the decision to increase valuation rates for property, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) on Tuesday held in abeyance the new valuations for taxation until January 16 next year in the wake of an extraordinary rise in property rates and complaints from realty stakeholders.  
The FBR had on December 1 revised upwards the property valuations for the purpose of taxation in 40 major cities of the country to bring them on a par with market rates. The rates were revised in order to charge actual income tax on property transactions.  
An official announcement said all chief commissioners inland revenue (CCIRs) would constitute valuation review committees (VRCs) and notify them by December 10. Any stakeholder having any reservations over the valuations may lodge a representation before the VRC by Dec 15.  
The CCIRs will undertake meaningful consultative processes with the stakeholders and engage the SBP-approved valuers for determination of values, which could be either more or less than the lately notified valuations.  
The FBR has already announced engaging top property valuation experts of the State Bank of Pakistan who will hold meaningful consultations with the key stakeholders, including real estate agents and town developers. This consultative process will review such cases individually and thereby make necessary recommendations to remove distortions if any and bring property value near market price.  
Until this process is completed, the application of new valuation rates will be suspended till mid-January 2022. The FBR received complaints from across the country from various stakeholders, including real estate agents and town developers, about an extraordinary rise in property rates resulting from the recently notified property valuation.  
To begin with, the FBR issued detailed instructions through an office memorandum on the procedure to be adopted to review the anomalies in the property rates and rationalise the same. Accordingly, it has been decided to review and revisit the notified valuation tables wherever overvaluation or undervaluation is pointed out by a stakeholder.  
It is pertinent to mention that the FBR is empowered to determine fair market value of immovable properties in terms of Section 68(4) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001. Therefore, the FBR vide SRO No.1534-1572(I)/2021 issued new valuation tables of properties across 40 major cities with a view to bringing them closer to the actual market prices.  
However, the FBR received certain objections from various stakeholders, including real estate agents and housing societies, highlighting anomalies and aberrations in the newly notified valuation tables. Although the notified valuations have been arrived at by the FBR Field Formations through a rigorous consultative process and wherefore have largely been well received, yet the possibility of error cannot be ruled out, and the same cannot be taken as carved in stone.  
The VRCs will take a decision on the representations by January 10, 2022, and forward the same to the FBR for notification. All recommendations made by the VRCs on revaluations will be re-notified on January 15, 2022, which will come into force on January 16.  
In the meantime, SRO1534-1572(I)/2021 is held in abeyance to allow registration of in-process transactions, said the announcement.",Newspaper

"Karachiites to pay Rs7.22bn more for power used in September
","December 8, 2021","ISLAMABAD: The National Ele­c­tric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Tuesday allowed K-Electric to charge Rs3.76 per unit additional cost to its consumers in December bills under monthly fuel cost adjustment (FCA) for electricity consumed in September to generate about Rs7.22bn.
The regulator had conducted on Nov 3 a public hearing on KE’s request for an increase of Rs3.454 per unit for September. In a petition submitted to Nepra under Multi-Year Tariff 2017-23, KE had requested the regulator to allow the company to pass on the burden of Rs6.639bn to the power consumers in its service area under monthly FCA for September.
Nepra chairman Tauseef H. Farooqui had then observed that such an additional charge “is huge and will be shocking for consumers”. However, in a notification issued on Tuesday, the regulator allowed KE to charge Rs3.757 per unit additional FCA to all consumers categories except lifeline consumers in December billing. The additional FCA would be shown separately in the consumers’ bills on the basis of units billed to the consumers in September.
In its determination, the regulator explained that KE had used the cost of energy purchased from national grid at rates approved by regulator for other ex-Wapda distribution companies (Discos) for August because the September rates were not available at the time.
However, as the energy cost for Discos for September was later notified by the regulator, these were also incorporated for the energy purchased by KE from Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA). “This has resulted in increase in total fuel cost by around Rs659.9 million,” the regulator said. This took the total demand to Rs7.29bn. After certain minor deductions, Nepra allowed KE to charge Rs7.22bn to consumers at the rate of Rs3.76 per unit.
The regulator pointed out that the power purchase agreement (PPA) was signed between National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) and K-Electric on Jan 26, 2010 for five years for sale/purchase of 650MW on basket rates. Subsequently, a decision was made by the Council of Common Interests (CCI) on Nov 8, 2012 for withdrawal of about 300MW from KE. 
However, the said decision of the CCI had been impugned through suits and petitions by KE in Sindh High Court. No new agreement had been signed between K-Electric and NTDC till date, and KE continues to draw about 1,100MW energy from the national grid.
The regulator also highlighted that KE did not operate Korangi and Site Gas Turbine Power Stations) to their full capacities, and drew less energy from efficient sources. Similarly, another plant Korangi Combined Cycle Power Plant was also operated on expensive high-speed diesel. 
Nepra also noted that according to KE, it was in discussions with the federal government and CPPA for around 2,050MW firm capacity from the national grid, and work on interconnection grids were being carried out. However, in case the required capacity is not provided by national grid and at the same time, KE has not installed its own power plants, this may result in loadshedding.
KE had generated 47pc electricity from its own power plants and procured 53pc from the national grid. The regulator noted that it was clear that the federal government was providing cheaper electricity to KE.",Pakistan

"Saad Rizvi sees TLP as 'kingmaker' in next general elections
","December 8, 2021","Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) chief Saad Hussain Rizvi, who was recently 
 from jail after nearly seven months in detention, foresees his party as a ""kingmaker"" in the 2023 general elections, saying that its vote bank will likely get a massive boost in Punjab and Sindh, provided that the polls are held in a free and fair manner. 
In an exclusive 
 with 
,  Rizvi said: ""No opposition will be able to function and no party will be able to make government without the support of the TLP,” as he went on to claim that his party's vote banks in Punjab and Sindh had experienced a massive boost since the last general elections. 
“The TLP enjoys good support in both provinces and its vote bank has increased manifold compared to last elections,” he told the magazine.
When asked about other political parties approaching him following his release and the chances of the TLP forming electoral alliances with them, Rizvi said they were ready to talk to all parties. However, he added, a final decision on the matter would be taken after taking into consideration ground realities ahead of the elections. 
To another question about women joining his party, Rizvi said they were willing to giving as much as 50 per cent representation to women in the TLP.
“We will not only encourage women to join the party on reserved seats, we plan to bring them on general seats as well,” he said. 
Rizvi's comments come less than a month after his release from Lahore's Kot Lakhpat jail on November 18 in the aftermath of an agreement with the government. The agreement had come following days of protest by his party workers, who also clashed with police, and were marching towards the capital. The details of the agreement were not made public.
Police had arrested Rizvi on April 12 as a ""pre-emptive measure"", ahead of planned protests by the TLP as the party's 
 for the implementation of the its demands — including the expulsion the French ambassador, severing ties with France and boycotting French products over blasphemous sketches of Holy Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) — neared. The next day, police had registered a first information report (FIR) against the TLP chief under sections of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA), 1997.  
His name was later placed on the Fourth Schedule — a list of proscribed individuals who are suspected of terrorism or sectarianism under the ATA — on April 16.
Rizvi's arrest had led to three days of 
 across the country, following which a 
 was placed on the party under the anti-terror law. This episode of the protest had reached a climax when Lahore became a 
 as TLP workers and policemen clashed, with the former taking 11 policemen hostage, who were 
 when the government and the TLP began talks.
However, the protest was called off on April 20, following a second round of talks between the government and the TLP, with Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid announcing that the government would present a resolution on the expulsion of the French ambassador in the National Assembly (NA) on the day.
A 
 of the NA was then called the same day during which a resolution was tabled to discuss and decide on the expulsion of the French ambassador from Pakistan. But since then, the assembly has not taken up the matter again.
However, at that time, Prime Minister Imran Khan had 
 that the government had no intention of lifting a ban on the TLP.
 
The TLP had then launched another round of protest in October, with scores of TLP workers taking to the streets in Lahore. They had later 
 a ""long march"" towards Islamabad, which is when the situation turned violent as party workers clashed with law enforcers. 
 of at least five policemen were reported in the riots.
Meanwhile, TLP protesters marching on the capital were stopped at Wazirabad, where they had camped until the then-proscribed group and the government had 
 a deal, the details of which have not been revealed till now.
Negotiations between the TLP and government had started on October 30, with the members of the negotiating team from the government side claiming the next day that they had reached an ""agreement"".
However, sources had told 
 at the time that the TLP was assured that the government would not pursue minor cases against the TLP leadership and workers, but the cases registered under the Anti-Terrorism Act would be decided by courts. It also assured the TLP leadership that it would unfreeze the accounts and assets of the proscribed outfit and take steps to lift the ban on it.
Following that, scores of arrested TLP workers were released from jail and its proscribed status was revoked, which automatically removed around 8,000 TLP activists from the Fourth Schedule. A 
 for the revocation of the ban on the TLP was issued by the Ministry of Interior on November 7.
Rizvi, in particular, had been released after the withdrawal of a reference filed in the Supreme Court's federal review board regarding his detention and the 
 of his name from the Fourth Schedule on November 11.
Speaking at a 
 in Lahore on the occasion of his father and the TLP's founder, Khadim Hussain Rizvi's death anniversary three days after his release, Rizvi had urged people to vote for his party in the next general elections.",Pakistan

"First blood to Hamilton in Abu Dhabi GP
","December 11, 2021","ABU DHABI: Lewis Hamilton’s quest to make Formula One history at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix began brightly with the Mercedes driver topping the timesheets after Friday’s opening practice.
Hamilton, chasing an unprecedented eighth world title, goes into Sunday’s season-closing race level on points with Max Verstappen.
And it was the Dutch title contender who was quickest out of the blocks at the Yas Marina circuit, taking the honours in the morning session.
Hamilton, placed third, turned the tables under floodlights in second practice with a 1min 23.691 lap to get his weekend off to an encouraging start.
“It doesn’t feel too bad,” said the 36-year-old Briton. “It started off good but got a bit worse in P1, then started off better in the second session with some changes we made.
“Now we just have to crank through the data and try to figure out how we can improve, where we home in. The target is always moving, but yes. Otherwise, I feel good.”
Alpine’s Esteban Ocon led the chasing pack, 0.343sec adrift, followed by Valtteri Bottas on his last run out for Mercedes before moving to Alfa Romeo in 2022.
Verstappen, who won at the circuit last year to end six years of domination by Mercedes, was placed fourth, at 0.641sec.
The Abu Dhabi track has undergone a major revamp since last year to improve overtaking opportunities, and on the evidence of opening practice it appears to suit Mercedes better than Red Bull.
“We’re still learning and understanding a few things,” reported the 24-year-old Verstappen.
Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said the boffins will be hard at work trying to find more speed to make up the difference in pace with Mercedes.
“We’ve still got 24 hours or 23 hours (before qualifying) to try and find a better set-up and a bit more pace.”
Hamilton approaches Sunday’s closing chapter of a 2021 season that will live long in the memory on a four-timer after wins in Brazil, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.
His late season surge sees the pair neck and neck at the top of the drivers’ standings — the last time that happened was in 1974.
The maths are simple — whoever finishes with more points takes the title.
But Verstappen will prevail should they both end up all square — (one finishes 9th, the other 10th with fastest lap) or fail to score any on the strength of winning nine races to Hamilton’s eight.Friday’s action was red-flagged at the end when Kimi Raikkonen, who is retiring after this weekend, crashed at turn 14.

","December 11, 2021","Prime Minister Imran Khan on Saturday said his government was ready to sit down and talk with anyone except for those who stole and laundered the nation's wealth abroad. 
Addressing a public gathering in his native Mianwali, which he was visiting to inaugurate multiple development projects, the premier said: ""We are ready to talk to everyone who has a different ideology or whom we call right or left. 
""We are ready to resolve our issues with them peacefully, be they in Balochistan or erstwhile tribal areas or Waziristan. The only ones whom we will never have any reconciliation with are those who looted and laundered the Pakistani people’s money."" 
""My government will never reconcile or give NRO (National Reconciliation Ordinance) to those who did corruption,"" he reiterated.
He said nations that struck deals with criminals got ""destroyed"" and could never develop because no one would bother to work hard if stealing wasn't considered reprehensible. 
""Every respectable society puts its thieves in jails and doesn't strike deals with them. The prosperous countries have [one] rule of law, while those that are poor have different laws for the powerful and the weak are in jails,"" the premier said. 
During his visit, the prime minister broke ground for 23 development projects worth approximately Rs36 billion in health, education and road sectors for the uplift of District Mianwali. He also inaugurated another three projects, which were completed at a cost of Rs5.4bn.  
The premier performed the groundbreaking ceremony of upgradation of the 38-kilometre Kalabagh-Shakardara road, which would cost Rs2.7bn and upgradation of District Headquarters Hospital with an estimated cost of Rs2bn.

"Uproar in Sindh Assembly as PPP passes amended LG bill
","December 11, 2021","A ruckus was witnessed in the Sindh Assembly on Saturday when the contentious Sindh Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2021 was passed again, with a few amendments to the original draft, amid an uproar by opposition members and a scuffle between Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf lawmakers and treasury members. 
In the bill, among the major changes conceded by the ruling PPP were removing the clause to elect any person (and not just elected members) as the mayor, deputy mayor, chairperson or vice-chairperson. The clause mandating elections for these posts through secret ballot was also removed.
The bill, which was initially 
 amid the opposition's absence during a session last month, primarily takes away functions of education and health from municipal bodies. It also abolishes district municipal corporations (DMCs) in urban parts of the province, replacing them with town municipal corporations.  
The bill has been 
 by the opposition, which had boycotted the assembly proceedings in protest when it was first presented there. However, the ruling party in the province, the PPP, had got it passed amid the opposition's absence in the same session on the basis of its numeric majority, following which it was sent to Sindh Governor Imran Ismail for his assent. Ismail had, however, 
 it to the Sindh Assembly for reconsideration.  
When the bill was presented again today (Saturday) by Sindh Local Government Minister Syed Nasir Hussain Shah before the House for reconsideration, opposition members stood on their seats and shouted slogans, such as ""robbery on rights is unacceptable"", and tore up copies of the agenda. 
They gathered in front of the speaker’s rostrum as the bill was passed, with the chair asking the protesting members to move to a side as he was unable to see Nasir moving the bill.
And Leader of the Opposition in the Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh went on to dub the bill ""a black law"". 
In his speech, Nasir said Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah had met Governor Ismail on the matter and the objections raised on the bill had been addressed. 
""There has been a hue and cry [on the bill], when we have actually given more powers to local government institutions,"" he remarked. 
The minister assured that local government representatives would be empowered under the new bill, adding that PPP Chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had called for increasing their powers.
Chief Minister Murad also addressed the House on the occasion, criticising the opposition for protesting against the bill. 
He commented that ""nothing is worse than an illiterate opposition"", explaining that the bill had been amended as per the governor's recommendations and it would again be sent to him for his assent.
Claiming that the bill was in line with the expectations of the people of Sindh, the chief minister added that the PPP had to pass the bill in urgency as the Election Commission Pakistan (ECP) had set a deadline.
He was referring to the ECP's 
 of November 30 for the Sindh government to provide prerequisites for holding local government elections in the province. 
But when the bill was first presented, ""they [the opposition] created a hue and cry instead of suggesting amendments to its,"" the chief minister said.
He added that there was still room for further amendments to the bill. 
Reacting to the opposition's criticism, he said: ""It was said that the occupation [of the assembly] was unacceptable. Are we occupying the Sindh Assembly?"" 
He then alleged the opposition was indulging in linguistic politics. 
In an apparent criticism of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, Shah commented: ""The one who created linguistic differences is sitting in London. You have disowned him but have not dissociated from his ideology.""
""Love Sindh. You are from Sindh,"" he continued, adding that the bill had been presented after consulting all stakeholders.
The assembly also passed the Sindh Solid Waste Management Bill, 2021 today, making mayors the co-chairpersons of the Sindh Solid Waste Management Board (SSWMB) along with the LG minister. The Sindh Civil Courts (Amendment) Bill, 2021 and The Sindh Factories (Second Amendment) Bill, 2021 were also passed.
Speaking about the Sindh Solid Waste Management Bill, 2021, in the House, Nasir said the clause on the mayor heading the SSWMB had been added on the opposition's demand. 
He said the SSWMB was formed because of the poor performance of DMCs and the board should comprise elected representatives. 
""Previously, the chief minister, and then the local government minister used to head it, and now a mayor will head it. This was demanded by the opposition and we have accepted this demand.""   
Later, Nasir addressed the media alongside Sindh Information Minister Saeed Ghani outside the provincial assembly. 
He told reporters that 80 per cent of the amendments proposed by the governor had been made to the local government bill. 
Moreover, Ghani rubbished the claims that the opposition was not allowed to debate the revised draft of the bill in today's session.
""To say that an opportunity was not given [to the opposition to speak] is completely wrong and [shows] their ignorance,"" he said. 
Ghani also criticised opposition members for their ""unruly behaviour and inappropriate conduct"" during today's proceedings, saying that many of the opposition's demands regarding the bill had been accepted by the Sindh government.",Pakistan

A division bench of the high court comprising Chief Justice Athar Minallah and Justice Aamer Farooq was hearing the NAB’s appeal against the acquittal of Mr Zardari in the Ursus tractor reference. An accountability court had acquitted Mr Zardari in the reference in 2014.
The reference pertains to alleged misappropriation of funds in the purchase of 5,900 Russian and Polish tractors at a cost of Rs150,000 each for the Awami Tractor Scheme. Mr Zardari was one of the main suspects along with his wife, slain former prime minister Benazir Bhutto. However, her name was later removed from the reference. According to the charge-sheet, the then government had launched the scheme in 1994 for import of tractors.
The tractor purchase deal allegedly caused a loss of Rs268.3 million to the Agriculture Development Bank of Pakistan — now called Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited — and Rs1.67 billion to the State Bank of Pakistan.
NAB Additional Prosecutor General Jahanzaib Khan Bharwana informed the bench that the original record of the reference had gone missing.
The court noted that it took the NAB seven years to realise that the appeals were filed without possessing the original record, and asked how it happened and warned of penalising the bureau for wasting the court’s time.
Bharwana told the court the record had gone missing while it was being transported from Lahore High Court to the Supreme Court.
Justice Minallah pointed out that the accountability court had acquitted the former president of the charges on merit, adding that it strengthened the perception that the NAB’s references were politically motivated.
“The NAB held others accountable but there is no mechanism of the bureau’s accountability,” the chief justice remarked.
“Do you know how the NAB’s actions adversely affected the national economy?” he asked the prosecutor. Besides, it also defames a citizen of Pakistan by filing references on flimsy reasons, he remarked.
The court issued directions to the NAB prosecutor general to examine the pending appeals and references and only those be kept in courts where the prosecution believed sufficient evidence was available to connect the suspect with the allegations.
Further hearing in the case was adjourned till a date to be fixed by the registrar’s office.",Pakistan

"Cricket Australia chief backs Tim Paine to make Test return
","December 10, 2021","MELBOURNE: Cricket Australia (CA) chief executive officer Nick Hockley hopes Tim Paine returns to country’s Test side  “as quickly as possible” after the wicket-keeper resigned from the captaincy because of his involvement in a  “sexting” scandal.

“Would love to see him play again, for both his state and for Australia,” Hockley told SEN. “We want to see him back out there, playing and performing, as quickly as possible.”
Hockley added that the CA had sought to support Paine through the situation.
“The head coach has been down to see him. We’ve had members of our high-performance set-up go down to [Tasmania]. The Tasmanian cricket community have put their arms around him,” Hockley said.
“We are all very, very concerned ... a lot of respect for Tim for owning his mistake and our job now is to really support him.”

"Budgetary borrowing doubles in five months
","December 10, 2021","KARACHI: The government’s borrowing for budgetary support surged 108 per cent to Rs104 billion during the first five months of the current fiscal year to bridge the widening fiscal gap, showed data released by the State Bank of Pakistan.
Since the spending remains at lower side during first half of the current fiscal year, the budgetary borrowing does not reflect the actual growing need for liquidity.
The government borrowed Rs50bn in the same period of last fiscal year but the fiscal deficit remained high at 7.5pc of GDP or Rs3.41 trillion at the end of FY21.
The fiscal deficit for FY22 has been projected at 6.8pc of GDP but the macro indicators suggest it could be much higher than the target. In the budget FY22, the fiscal deficit was projected at Rs3.99 trillion. The sources of financing were Rs1,246bn from net external financing, Rs2,492bn from net domestic financing and Rs252 as privatisation proceeds.
The government has accumulated most of the liquidity from the domestic sources like treasury bills and Pakistan investment bonds while the net outflow from National Savings Schemes (NSS) reduced the chance to borrow any higher amount.

"Biden orders ‘preparations’ in case Iran nuclear-talks fail
","December 10, 2021","WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden has ordered his staff to prepare “additional measures” if 
 over Iran’s nuclear programme, which resumed on Thursday in Vienna, fail to reach a resolution.
“The president has asked his team to be prepared in the event that diplomacy fails and we must turn to other options,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters.
“We will have no choice but to take additional measures,” she added.
The latest round of talks began last week and were paused on Dec 3 after Western participants accused Iran of going back on progress made earlier this year.
International diplomats restarted the talks on Thursday for what the chair of the negotiations called the “difficult endeavour” of reviving the 2015 deal between Iran and world powers.

"Media mogul Jimmy Lai among three HK activists convicted over Tiananmen vigil
","December 10, 2021","HONG KONG: Jailed Hong Kong media mogul Jimmy Lai was among three democracy campaigners convicted on Thursday for taking part in a banned Tiananmen vigil as the prosecution of multiple activists came to a conclusion.
Lai, the 74-year-old owner of the now-shuttered pro-democracy 
 newspaper, was found guilty of unlawful assembly charges alongside former journalist Gwyneth Ho and prominent rights lawyer Chow Hang-tung.
Authorities had charged more than two dozen pro-democracy politicians and activists over a vigil last year, which commemorated the victims of Beijing’s deadly Tiananmen crackdown in 1989 despite a police ban.
The trio were the only ones to contest their charges in court, meaning they were the last to receive their verdict.
They argued they went to light candles in a personal capacity and had not “incited” others to join an outlawed rally.
At one point, Chow, a trained barrister who represented herself in court, likened her actions to “tank man” — the figure who famously stood in front of a Chinese tank during the Tiananmen crackdown and became an icon.
But District Court judge Amanda Woodcock dismissed those arguments as “frankly nonsensical” and convicted them of charges including inciting and taking part in an unauthorised assembly.
“The reality was, any intention to come out and participate in the candlelight vigil in Victoria Park that night was an act of defiance and protest against the police,” Woodcock ruled.
Amnesty International described the verdicts as the latest “attack on the rights to freedom of expression and assembly” in Hong Kong and said authorities had criminalised a “peaceful, socially distanced vigil”.
The convictions come as authorities crack down on dissent in Hong Kong and remould the once outspoken finance hub in the mainland’s authoritarian image after huge and often violent democracy protests two years ago.
In practical terms, the latest verdicts make minimal difference to the convicted. Lai, Chow and Ho are among dozens of activists already behind bars facing separate prosecutions under a strict national security law that Beijing imposed on Hong Kong last year.
But their prosecution illustrates how much the gap has narrowed between Hong Kong and the mainland, where authorities have long sought to scrub memories and official records of Tiananmen.
For three decades, Hong Kong’s annual June 4 candlelight vigil would attract tens of thousands of people, which — with its slogans for democracy and ending one-party rule in China — became a symbol for the political freedoms enjoyed in the city.
But Hong Kong authorities have banned the last two vigils citing both the coronavirus pandemic and security fears.
This year, Beijing made it clear it will no longer tolerate Tiananmen commemorations in Hong Kong or Macau, the only two places within China where public remembrance could take place.
Multiple organisers of the annual vigil — including Chow — were charged with the national security crime of subversion while a June 4 museum they ran was closed by authorities and its exhibits carted away.",Newspaper
"PM Imran inaugurates Karachi's much-awaited Green Line bus service
","December 10, 2021","Prime Minister Imran Khan on Friday formally inaugurated the Green Line Bus Rapid Transit project in Karachi, with the city's residents seeing a ray of hope for their notorious public transport woes.
The premier, who arrived in Karachi earlier in the day, was accompanied at the ceremony by senior officials, including Sindh Governor Imran Ismail and federal Planning Minister Asad Umar.
Prime Minister Imran also visited a bus station, where he inspected the infrastructure and also received a briefing on how the ticketing system works. 
			
Addressing the inauguration ceremony, the premier congratulated Umar and the Sindh Infrastructure Development Company Limited (SIDCL) ""for pursuing this project with utter determination"". 
""No modern city can function without modern transport,"" he said, citing the example of hugely populated Chinese cities with effective public transport facilities.
Terming Karachi ""Pakistan's engine of growth"", he said the metropolis' prosperity had a positive effect on the entire country.
""Making Karachi functional and successful means we are helping Pakistan,"" he remarked, calling the Green Line transport system the first step towards building a modern city. 
Prime Minister Imran regretted that Karachi's transport issues were never paid heed to. ""I have been seeing Karachi for 50 years. We have seen its transformation into a cave because we did not focus on its administration,"" he said. 
			
Quoting the example of the Iranian capital, he said even though the country was under US sanctions, Tehran had modern facilities because of its efficient management. 
""Tehran collects $500 million [in revenue] and spends it through planning. In comparison, Karachi doesn't even collect $30m,"" he noted, stressing the need to give Karachi autonomy for the local government system to succeed. 
The premier said he was also pursuing the Greater Karachi Water Supply Scheme project, also called K-IV, through coordination with Wapda. The project will be approved by next month following which its groundbreaking will be performed, and it will be completed in 14-15 months.
""By Aug-Sept 2023, we will be supplying water to Karachi from Keenjhar lake,"" he said.
Detailing other public welfare projects that the government is focusing on, the prime minister said the health card scheme was successfully being rolled out in PTI-ruled provinces. ""I want to tell the Sindh government that provinces are contributing in it and they must also play their part,"" he added.
He also called upon the provincial government to reconsider its opposition to the federal government's plan to develop islands near Karachi into real-estate projects. 
""Our population is growing. We are building a modern city named Ravi City in Lahore and taking care of the environment there,"" Imran said. ""Pollution levels are also high in Karachi and it is necessary to have a modern city like the Bundal Island project. When we undertake projects, it is better if we do it collectively with coordination.""
Earlier, Planning Minister Umar thanked the SIDCL and parliamentarians from Karachi for their efforts for the project. He said the Sindh governor was ""supervising"" the project since the PTI came to power. In Dec 2020, he said, the SIDCL became a part of the planning ministry and the government started working on the project.
			
The minister recalled that the project had been approved in 2016, and while the PML-N stayed in power for the next 28 months, the project's infrastructure was not built. 
""The order for the buses was also not placed and neither was the payment system designed; the operation and maintenance tender was also not placed,"" he said, adding that the PML-N only thought about building a track surrounded by grills ""with no other facilities available"". 
""Karachi's rights were not given to the city in the last three of their (PML-N and PPP's) governments,"" Umar remarked.
Lashing out at the PPP, Umar said the party merely used the name of Sindh, while the PTI-led government actually worked for the province.
Calling Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari an ""innocent child"", the minister said the PPP chairman had asked for ""time"" to work for Sindh. ""Dear child, 50 years ago your grandfather was made the chief martial law administrator of the president of Pakistan. How much more time do you need?""
He said the party had formed government in the province six times and four times in the Centre, but still had nothing to show for it.
Commenting on the Karachi Transformation Plan announced by the prime minister last year, he said the scheme included five major projects, one of which — the Green Line project — was being inaugurated today. ""Commercial operations will begin on December 25 and total operations will start by January 10,"" he announced.
He said that the second project concerned the construction of stormwater drains in the city, adding that work on the Mehmoodabad nullah had been completed and it would be inaugurated in 10 days. The minister further said 50 per cent of the work on the Gujjar and Orangi nullahs had been completed.
Umar said the federal government had also taken responsibility for the K-IV water supply project after it was abandoned, adding that the PC-1 for the project had been submitted to the planning ministry and work would begin within two months.
According to the minister, the Frontier Works Organisation had been mobilised for the Karachi Circular Railway (KCR) project and work had begun on the ground. ""Not only local, but international companies are also showing interest in the project,"" he revealed.
He remarked that the PTI government was making solid progress on all the projects announced under the transformation programme. ""We don't just make promises, we deliver.""
Work on the Rs16.85 billion federal government-funded bus project had begun after then-prime minister Nawaz Sharif inaugurated it in February 2016 by performing the groundbreaking.
Later, the project was extended by another 10 kilometres as initially sought by the Sindh government and the estimated cost crossed the figure of Rs24bn.
The project was estimated to be completed by the end of 2017, but kept getting new deadlines. Since the launch of the scheme, the battered roads on either side of the route have turned into a great source of nuisance for commuters and for the shopkeepers doing their businesses.
The second and final consignment of 40 buses for the Green Line project arrived in the city on Oct 21, raising the number of buses to 80 and rekindling citizens’ hope that the Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) in the metropolis was set to be launched. It is supposed to facilitate the travel of approximately 300,000 passengers daily.
The first batch of 40 buses had arrived in the city on Sept 19 which the planning minister had referred to as a “ray of hope” and “milestone”, calling it the beginning of modern public transport service for Karachiites after a long gap of 40 years.",Pakistan
"Paramedics in Lahore await Covid risk allowance
","December 13, 2021","LAHORE: The Punjab government seems to be indifferent towards paramedics and other lower-grade employees who had been doing their duties during the Covid-19 pandemic at the state-run hospitals as they still await the payment of special risk allowance as promised by Chief Minister Usman Buzdar last year for their services.
The chief minister had announced during the first wave of Covid-19 in March last year that special risk allowance, equal to one salary, will be paid to the doctors, nurses, medical staff and others engaged in the treatment of the patients affected by the coronavirus.
Declaring it a glaring example of “discrimination”, these employees say the health department paid special risk allowance or Covid allowance to the doctors and nurses but denied the same to the lower grade staff of the public hospitals.
The Pakistan Health Support Staff Association (PHSSA) has warned of a province-wide agitation, stating that if the government continued to show apathy towards the lower health staff, thousands of these employees would take to the street, demanding their right.
PHSSA president Rana Pervez, chairman Hakeem Khan Niazi, Amanat Ali and other office- bearers also took up the matter of non-payment of the allowance with heath secretary Dr Ahmad Javed Qazi in a meeting held here the other day.
Rana Pervez deplored the government’s discrimination against the paramedics and other supporting staff and warned it was causing unrest among them.
“We are giving time to the health secretary and other high-ups for payment of risk allowance to the paramedics as was promised by the chief minister and if our demand was not met, we reserve the right to take any step,” Rana Pervez said.
Amanat Ali said these employees risked their lives while attending the Covid patients and were still discharging their duties in corona wards and emergency units of the public hospitals during the 4th wave of the paramedics.
In many cases, he said, the critical Covid patients were left unattended even by the doctors and nurses, but the supporting staff kept on taking care of them.
He appealed to the chief minister to take notice of the “discriminatory policy” of the health authorities and direct them to treat all hospital employees, including doctors, nurses and paramedics, equally.",Pakistan

"PML-N assails govt’s ‘fresh attempt to put Shehbaz in jail’
","December 13, 2021","ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) declared on Sunday that Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) would not be deployed at the time of general elections in 2023. 
The main opposition party expressed fears the government was again trying to send Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif behind bars — this time through the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA). 
On the other hand, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Political Communication Dr Shahbaz Gill said Mr Sharif should answer the queries raised by FIA in the Rs25 billion corruption case against him. 
Speaking at a press conference, PML-N’s information secretary Marriyum Aurangzeb said: “Imran Khan does not care about people because he is not an elected PM; he believes the next elections will be held through EVMs and that he does not need people’s votes as he will win by rigging the machines. But the next elections will not be held through EVMs.” 
Asked about the basis of her claim that the next elections would not be held through EVMs, she said: “Imran Khan knows people will not vote for him, so elections will not be held through EVMs.” 
The government seems to be adamant about introducing EVMs at the time of next elections and for the purpose it got the parliament to 
 regarding the use of EVMs in the polls. However, the opposition parties have expressed fears that the use of EVMs will pave the way to systematic rigging in the elections. The Election Commission of Pakistan has also objected to the use of EVMs in the polls. 
Ms Aurangzeb alleged that Mr Khan’s “fresh witch-hunt against Mr Sharif through FIA” was just another attempt to imprison the opposition leader on fictitious charges so that he could not expose the government’s corruption and incompetence. 
“Ever since being imposed on the country in 2018, the corrupt, cruel and incompetent Imran (Khan) has done nothing other than abusing government resources to monitor and persecute the PML-N leadership,” she said. 
The PML-N spokesperson said that even after putting behind bars former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, his daughter Maryam Nawaz and other party leaders — including Shehbaz Sharif, Hamza Shehbaz, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, Khawaja Asif, Ahsan Iqbal, Khawaja Saad Rafiq and Rana Sanaullah — the government had failed miserably to prove “a single penny of corruption against them”. That’s why most of them had been granted bail by courts. 
She claimed that Mr Khan’s “unholy” alliance with the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) had failed to keep Shehbaz behind bars because the government had failed to produce any evidence against the PML-N president. 
“Imran Sahib, this drama should end now. When the NAB-Niazi nexus has failed, the same cases are being reopened by the FIA. The same questionnaires have cropped up again that were responded to by Mr Sharif three years ago,” she said. 
The opposition lawmaker alleged that there was no accountability in cases involving the government’s wrongdoings, in flour, sugar, gas and Rawalpindi Ring Road scams. “The government either takes stay orders or hushes up its massive corruption in the Ring Road, Peshawar BRT, flour, sugar, electricity, gas and medicine (scandals),” she said. 
The PML-N spokesperson said everybody should recall how the premier’s adviser Shahzad Akbar used to sit in the Press Information Department to “level fake allegations of corruption” at Mr Sharif. “Imran had formed a special cell to put Shehbaz Sharif in jail, but the courts granted him bail, compelling the NAB and the government to withdraw their petitions,” she added. 
Ms Aurangzeb was of the view that the government had checked each and every bank account of the Sharif family and searched its every business and every company but “couldn’t prove any corruption” against them. 
Responding to the PML-N spokesperson’s statement, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Dr Shahbaz Gill said the “thieves who remained in power for three decades are simply reaping what they have sown”. 
He was of the opinion that people had full confidence in the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf. “Marriyum Aurangzeb should give account of the money of her masters instead of waging a propaganda battle,” he said. 
The “corrupt leaders who had plundered the national wealth” and went abroad for “bringing medicines” should return to the country and answer the questions put to them. “When will the then finance minister return?” 
Both Nawaz Sharif and Ishaq Dar should return and face the court cases against them, Dr Gill added.",Pakistan

A spokesman for Bennett, Matan Sidi, later confirmed: “The entourage of the prime minister has landed now in Abu Dhabi, the UAE, for PM Bennett’s first visit to the country.” Before boarding the plane, the prime minister said his trip “is aimed at deepening the cooperation between the countries, in all fields”.",Newspaper
"Can the arhti be eliminated?
","December 13, 2021","In the recent episode of hyperinflation and the galloping commodity prices, a market player that has constantly been attacked for profiteering and manipulation is the arhti. It is, of course, a repeat of the chorus from all such episodes in the past. Once prices stabilise somewhat, business as usual will return. 
Also forgotten will be the fact that that the farmers are the most excluded lot when it comes to formal credit. The total stock of private sector credit at the end of 2020-21 was Rs7.63 trillion. Out of this, a mere Rs 292.3 billion was the share of agriculture. 
In the first month of the current fiscal year, the flow of credit to agriculture declined by Rs8.8bn or almost seven times the decline in the corresponding month of last year. This is despite the fact that banks are given targets by the State Bank and noncompliance invites penalties.
Paying penalties is, however, deemed by the banks as less costly than the hassles of compliance in an area that gives them little comfort. Commercial banks are used to lending to a profligate government to live happily ever after.
This is where the arhti comes in. The field is left open to him and he exploits it to the fullest. He performs a useful function. For the farmer, it’s a Hobson’s choice. The arhti is there when he needs cash for inputs. He facilitates the movement of output from the farm to the commodity market at prices that favour him rather than the farmer. In times of crop failures and personal needs such as births, deaths and marriages, he is like the next-door neighbour. He charges a lot more than is his due when the going is good. The interest can be as high as 70-80 per cent, and roll-overs are easily granted. 
Lending is in money, but the servicing is usually in kind. Both sides avoid using the word interest. In short, arhti caters to the needs of production, development and consumption. The last-mentioned is a no-go for bank lending.
An International Growth Centre (IGC) study in 2013 prescribed the creation of an intermediary that functions like the arhti, but without its exploitative and speculative characteristics. “To create a win-win, where farmers and banks both benefit, a model involving an ‘intermediary’ that incorporates the arhti’s strategies needs to be tested. 
The ‘intermediary’ would connect the bank to the clients and play the role that the arthi plays, with value-added services (such as access to latest farming techniques, modern farm equipment and inputs that can help increase yield and productivity). 
The intermediary, like the arthi, would help manage the bank’s risk by a) identifying the right client b) correctly assessing his credit needs c) ensuring that loan proceeds are used for the intended purpose d) controlling the farmer’s cash flows by managing his crop’s sale proceeds. 
The intermediary’s value-added service relating to farm efficiency and productivity would further reduce the credit risk. Insurance against catastrophic risks (such as floods or pest attacks) would need to be built into the model as these tend to be the only systemic threat.
Could the intermediary be the microfinance banks? These have been in the field for quite some time, but their footprint in the rural economy remains limited. To a certain extent, they act like commercial banks and, to that extent, are disabled to adapt to the arhti’s function. In the first quarter of the current fiscal year, they disbursed 15.4pc of their annual target, even less than 19.3pc by commercial banks.
The inspiration for the IGC study came from a project undertaken by the National Rural Support Programme (NRSP) in 2001, called the Sugarcane Production Enhancement Project (SPEP). It aimed to link the small farmer, microfinance institutions and the processor in a high-impact value chain with high financial and social returns. 
Some 1,800 small farmers were organised and extended loans ranging from Rs7,000-10,000 per acre to buy inputs. To improve yield per acre, an institutional mechanism was created to provide modern advisory services. 
The soil was tested to set up a benchmark and the farmer was obliged to follow the guidance of the advisory services. An agreement was signed between the sugar mill and NRSP to buy all output with prompt cash payment.
This experiment’s success can be judged by the fact that the registered farmers had doubled by the end of the third year. The project was able to reach 3,666 smallholder farmers. Per acre yield increased and the contribution of small farmers to the overall sugarcane supply of the mill reached 11.5pc. 
The small farmer benefitted from high incomes because of improved yields and the sugar mill from getting high-quality yields which lead them to plan for expansion of their factory.
Most importantly, this collaboration benefited small farmers because investments were made in developing infrastructure irrigation, and technical guidance regarding seed and farm equipment. The social impact has been assessed by a third party evaluation and found to be highest amongst all NRSP microfinance investments. The SPEP project is now operational in 44 union councils of Rahim Yar khan with registered smallholder farmers. 
Today, 15pc of sugar mill supply (after extending the production capacity of sugar mills) is provided by communities organised by NRSP. They are now able to obtain a yield of around 32 tonnes of sugarcane per acre. The experiment demonstrated that the generational bondage between the small farmer and the shop arhti can be broken.

"Pakistan’s progress on SDGs
","December 13, 2021","The Sustainable Development Report 2021 has been released and hotly debated among policy circles. Here I take a deeper look at the report with a reference to Pakistan. 
An annual publication, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Index claims to track a country’s performance on the 17 SDGs. The report combines data and analyses produced by the United Nations, the World Bank and others as well as from non-official sources (research institutions and non-governmental organisations). 
It is not an official SDG monitoring tool but instead complements efforts of national statistical offices and international organisations to collect data on and standardise SDG indicators. Due to time lags in data generation, reporting and addition of new indicators, this year’s SDG Index and dashboards do not fully reflect the impact of Covid19. 
Owing to changes in the indicator selection, the 2021 rankings and scores are not comparable with last year’s results. The report points to consider countries’ performances at the goal and indicator level. 
The report highlights that the pandemic has been a huge setback for sustainable development. For the first time since the adoption of the SDGs in 2015, the global average SDG Index score for 2020 has decreased from the previous year: a decline driven to a large extent by increased poverty rates and unemployment following the outbreak.
The score signifies a country’s position between the worst (0) and the best or target (100) outcomes. 
Pakistan with an overall Index score in 2021 of 57.7 means that the country is on average 57.7 per cent on the way to the best possible outcome across the 17 SDGs. This score is 1.5pc higher than the country’s score in 2020. Pakistan is categorised in the East and South Asia region that comprises 21 countries including China and Singapore, pushing the regional scores upward. Compared to 2020, Pakistan’s performance has increased by 3pc in the region. 
Despite the Covid-19 global pushback, Pakistan’s SDG Global Rank is 129 (out of 193) in 2021, improved by five ranks, 134 (out of 166) in 2020. Compared to its neighbours, Bangladesh’s rank stayed at 109 during 2020 and 2021. India’s rank declined by three, from 117 to 120 between 2020 to 2021. 
Despite the overall improvement in the score, in terms of trends for Goals’ achievement, Pakistan’s performance is only on track against Goal 13 (Climate Action). All other goals’ progress is either moderately improving or stagnating and worsening in the case of Goal 15 (Life on Land).
The report does not refer to national and updated data sets at some places, thus affecting the ranking and scoring of the country. The report acknowledges that data lags in reporting. This means some of the progress in certain areas that countries including Pakistan made remains unaccounted for in the report. For example, against SDGs indicator 7.1.1, the proportion of the population with access to electricity is reported to be declining and at 71.1pc (2018). According to updated national data sources (Pakistan Social and Living Standards Measurement), access to electricity has increased by 3pc between 2015 to 2020 and stands at 96pc in 2020 including 5pc off-grid. 
Similarly, population with access to clean fuels and technology for cooking, SDGs indicator 7.1.2, has been reported 43.3pc (2016). According to the latest national data sources (PSLM), the population with access to clean fuels and technology for cooking increased by 5.7pc between 2015 to 2019 and stands at 47pc in 2019-20.
The government has taken a number of steps to help keep the achievement of SDGs on track. To measure the effects of Covid-19 and to produce an evidence-based plan, the government initiated a dedicated survey. 
According to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics Covid-19 specific survey (2020), 27.31 million working population was affected. Related to SDG 1 (No Poverty) and SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) and SDG 8 on Decent Work and Economic Growth, 20.6m people could not work during the first wave of the pandemic in 2020. Whereas 6.7m people said that their income was declined. As a coping mechanism, half of the households reduced their non-food expenditures and 74pc of the informal workers were affected. 
The government came up with an Rs1.24 trillion stimulus package to boost the overall economic situation and especially, in a bid to reduce the impact of Covid-19 on poverty (SDG 1), hunger (SDG 2), health (SDG 3) and SDG 8 on Decent Work and Economic Growth. 
Related to SDG 3 on Good Health and Well-being, even before Covid-19, Pakistan had a fragile healthcare system with insufficient facilities to meet the needs of the population. There is on average one hospital bed available for over 1,680 people. 
Related to SDG 4 on Quality Education, the Covid-19 pandemic directly impacted 42m children from pre-primary and primary to higher secondary and degree college levels. Mobility constraints, non-availability of internet, non-access to tele-schooling facilities had a disproportionate adverse impact on the most vulnerable groups, particularly females and other marginalised groups and those in rural areas and urban slums.
The government is continuing with the better containment of pandemic along with the roll-out of vaccination and continuation of Ehsaas Programme, linked to SDG 1, SDG 2, SDG 3 and SDG 4. As of December 1, 2021, 33pc (5.07m) of Pakistan’s eligible population has been fully vaccinated with a total of 124.05m vaccines administered. Taking timely action in view of the new coronavirus variant Omicron, the government, NCOC, also approved a booster shot of Covid-19 vaccines for healthcare workers, immunocompromised people and those aged over 50 years on December 1, 2021.
One of the key areas of government’s attention is education. Concerning education achievements, the country’s progress has been dismal. The primary completion rate has stagnated at 67pc in five years between 2015-20. Similarly, the gender gap of 9pc between the primary completion rate of males and females has also persisted in this period. 
The government, like other developing countries, faces huge fiscal challenges to meet SDGs. This has been also been acknowledged in the Sustainability Report 2021. According to an International Monetary Fund study (2021) on the costing of SDGs relating to education, health and physical capital (electricity, roads, and water and sanitation), additional annual spending of about 16pc of GDP will be required until 2030 from the public and private sectors combined to help these SDGs.

"Will the Sialkot incident affect GSP Plus?
","December 13, 2021","Ladies stripped and paraded, hundreds of rapes taped, a person burnt to death, but the business mill continues.
While random unverified tweets claim that Pakistan’s exports orders are suffering in the aftermath of the horrific 
, all stakeholders contacted were unified in vociferously discrediting such a notion.
“It is an isolated incident,” said Khurrum Mukhtar, Patron in Chief of the Pakistan Textile Exporters Association. “The community responded in a positive manner and the government swiftly took action so I do not think that GSP Plus will be affected either.”
Other stakeholders admitted that while there was some reputational damage, there was no negative news from Lahore or Faisalabad, the bigger markets, of a drop in orders or a change in business as usual.
“Overall it was a disaster,” said a stakeholder who requested to not be named, “we can only do damage control now. But the country’s overall response, religious cleric statements and joint visits to the Sri Lankan embassy helped contain the situation.” The business community of Sialkot is trying to compensate the family with $100,000 and a lifetime pension for the wife, he added.
There seem to be no short term business repercussions of a mob murdering a man, perhaps for personal vengeance under the guise of the blasphemy law, but it can have longer-term consequences for when the GSP Plus is reviewed.
“It will figure somewhere when Pakistan’s status is being considered,” said Dr Manzoor Ahmed, a former ambassador to the World Trade Organisation .“These things have been adding up. The European Union would like to exercise some pressure, especially with regards to the blasphemy law.”
Earlier this year, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling for a review of the GSP plus status granted to Pakistan in view of the “alarming” increase in the use of blasphemy accusations in the country.
The European Parliament highlights that while there have never been official executions, Pakistan’s blasphemy laws incite harassment, violence and murder against those accused. Regardless of the judicial procedures, people accused of blasphemy fear for their lives though it is widely known that the laws are manipulated for the personal interests of the accuser. A lot of those accused are human rights defenders, journalists, artists or the most marginalised people in society.
GSP Plus is viewed as a tool to enforce human rights in less developed countries. Those who point to the white portion of the flag or sprout quranic ayats and hadiths claiming that minorities are protected in Pakistan belong in straitjackets for their delusions.
A whole host of laws and policy measures exist on paper to broadcast Pakistan’s theoretical progress of human rights but the Sialkot incident is just one among many; there is no doubt that there will be another Priyantha Kumara in a few months, if not weeks.
And while business continues as usual, beyond words of condemnation and the furious Twitterati there will be no change. The reckoning, if and when it comes, in terms of a formal boycott of Pakistan’s products, sanctions, or removal of GSP Plus status, will also be more on political grounds than actual outrage.  
Brexit has ensured that the United Kingdom, an ally historically, has no say in the GSP Plus review process. Southern Europe limited competes with some of Pakistan’s exports. France can hardly be expected to look kindly at a country that is placating a party that has been staging violent anti-France protests and demanding the expulsion of the French envoy.
To say nothing of the Muslim beheading the French school teacher Samuel Paty who showed caricatures in his class. The blasphemy mania has infected other countries with teachers in France claiming they are more cautious with what they say, according to media reports.
Punishing Pakistan through the withdrawal of GSP Plus is a line that European countries may pursue further down the road. And if the governments choose to exercise restraint, the consumers may not be so forgiving.
“On the purchase side, consumers check the label before buying a product. At least for a while there is a reaction and potential buyers shift to a competitor from another country,” said Dr Ahmed.     
Regardless of the horrific nature of the most ghastly crimes in Pakistan, without an uproar from the international community that inflicts monetary damage, the worst among us continue to feel sanctioned. If the West chooses to inflict penalties high enough for the pain to be felt in the upper echelons of the powers that be, only then they will feel the need to influence the narrative on the ground. But for the moment, business continues as usual with no change on the horizon. ",Newspaper
"Putin says he drove cab after Soviet fall
","December 13, 2021","MOSCOW: Russian President Vladimir Putin has said the collapse of the Soviet Union spelled the end of  “historical Russia,” revealing he drove a taxi to make ends meet following the USSR’s fall.
Putin, a former agent of the Soviet Union’s KGB security services, who has previously lamented the USSR’s fall, said the disintegration three decades ago remains a  “tragedy” for  “most citizens”.
The comments, reported by state-run news agency 
 on Sunday, were excerpts from an upcoming film by broadcaster 
, dubbed  “Russia Recent History”.
“After all, what is the collapse of the Soviet Union? This is the collapse of historical Russia under the name of the Soviet Union,” the Russian leader was cited as saying.
A loyal servant of the Soviet Union, Putin was dismayed when it fell apart, once calling the collapse  “the greatest geopolitical disaster of the 20th century”.
Putin is sensitive to the perceived expansion of Western military ambitions into ex-Soviet countries and Russia this week demanded that Nato formally scrap a 2008 decision to open its door to Georgia and Ukraine. The end of the Union brought with it a period of intense economic instability that plunged many into poverty, as newly independent Russia transitioned from communism to capitalism.
, reporting from excerpts of the documentary, said Putin had revealed that he worked occasionally as a taxi driver to boost his income. 
“Sometimes I had to earn extra money,” Putin said.
“I mean, earn extra money by car, as a private driver. It’s unpleasant to talk about to be honest but, unfortunately, that was the case.” Russia was the centre of the Soviet Union that grew to include 15 republics from the Baltics in the West to Central Asia.
In 1991, wracked by economic woes the Soviet Union disintegrated and Russia became an independent nation.",Newspaper
"New Caledonia rejects independence from France in boycotted vote
","December 13, 2021","NOUMEA: Islanders on the Pacific territory of New Caledonia voted overwhelmingly on Sunday to remain part of France in a third referendum that was boycotted by pro-independence groups, raising fears of new tensions.
With all ballots counted, 96.49 percent were against independence, while only 3.51 percent were in favour, with turnout a mere 43.90 percent, results from the islands’ high commission showed.
“Tonight France is more beautiful because New Caledonia has decided to stay part of it,” President Emmanuel Macron said in a recorded video message that made no direct mention of the boycott.
Police reinforcements have been sent to the territory known as  “the pebble”, which is of strategic importance to France and part of a wider tussle for influence in the Pacific between Western countries and China.
The boycott and crushing nature of the  “No” vote will raise fears of protests as well as questions about the democratic legitimacy of the referendum on the archipelago, 2,000 kilometres (1,250 miles) east of Australia.
Macron noted  “the high abstention rates” but said France could be  “proud” of a more than 30-year process designed to settle the islands’ status under which residents were asked in three separate referendums if they wished to break away.
Having rejected independence in 2018 and then again last year, inhabitants were called on Sunday to answer one last time whether they wanted New Caledonia  “to accede to full sovereignty and become independent”.
Pro-independence campaigners boycotted the vote, saying they wanted it postponed to September because  “a fair campaign” was impossible with high coronavirus infection numbers.
The result could exacerbate ethnic tensions, with the poorer indigenous Kanak community who generally favour independence staying away from polling booths on Sunday. The wealthier white community turned out in large numbers.
“We have decided in our souls and consciences to remain French,” Sonia Backes, a senior pro-France figure, told supporters on Sunday evening.
“The sad dreams of an independence at the cost of ruin, of exclusion and misery have crashed on the reef of our pioneering spirit, our resilience and our love for our own land,” she added.
The main indigenous pro-independence movement, the FLNKS, had called the government’s insistence on going ahead with the referendum  “a declaration of war”.
Kanaks had also been called by their traditional community leaders to observe a day’s mourning on Sunday for those killed by the coronavirus.
Around 2,000 police and troops were deployed for the vote, which appeared to have passed off largely without incident except for an attempted roadblock on an outlying island.
At stake in the vote was one of France’s biggest overseas territories which is home to about 10 percent of the world’s reserves of nickel, which is used to make stainless steel, batteries and mobile phones.
The territory is also a key part of France’s claim of being a Pacific power, with New Caledonia granting France rights to the surrounding ocean, as well as serving as a military staging post.",Newspaper
"Max Verstappen wins first F1 title with last lap pass of Lewis Hamilton
","December 13, 2021","			
ABU DHABI: The most dramatic Formula One season in years ended, of course, in one of the most dramatic finishes possible when Max Verstappen snatched the world championship away from Lewis Hamilton with a pass on the final lap of the Abu Dhabi GP. 
Mercedes filed two protests after the race. 
Hamilton was five laps away from passing Michael Schumacher in the record books with an eighth championship Sunday until a crash gave Verstappen and Red Bull one final chance. 
Whatever Hamilton said over his radio when Nicholas Latifi crashed to bring out the safety car was only played as one long beep to cover the expletives. 
F1 race director Michael Masi took his time figuring out how to conclude the race before controversially settling on one final lap of racing to decide the title. Verstappen started the final lap just behind Hamilton, chasing him through the first four turns. 
Verstappen made his pass in the fifth turn and Hamilton had one last shot. He pulled his Mercedes even with the Red Bull but couldn’t clear Verstappen, who surged ahead to become the first Dutch world champion. 
Verstappen and Red Bull celebrated in a champagne soak, received hugs from his fellow competitors including Hamilton and Hamilton’s father and made his way to the DJ stand at Yas Marina Circuit and jumped wildly up and down to the music. 
“It’s just insane, I mean, my goal when I was little was to become a Formula One driver and to go for wins, to be on the podium,” said Verstappen. “When they play the national anthem, you want it to be yours and when you stand here and they tell you that you are the world champion, it’s something incredible and special.”
			
It was a fitting end to a season that saw the two contenders go wheel-to-wheel over 22 races spanning four continents and arrive in Abu Dhabi tied in the championship standings. It marked the first time the contenders were equal at the season finale since 1974. 
“Congratulations to Max and to his team, I think he did an amazing job this year,” Hamilton said. 
This bitter rivalry between Mercedes and Red Bull got the ending it deserved one that left the victor speechless. 
“Oh my God!” Verstappen screamed over his radio as he crossed the finish line.
“You are the world champion! The world champion!” screamed back Red Bull boss Christian Horner. 
“Let’s do this for another 10 or 15 years!” Verstappen replied. 
Red Bull won their first F1 title since 2013; Mercedes had won every championship since.
The mood was far different in the Mercedes camp, where Hamilton sat motionless in his car for several moments as other drivers made their way to congratulate Verstappen. The defeat ended his reign of four consecutive titles and denied Hamilton a chance to pass Schumacher as best all-time in F1. 
Mercedes boss Toto Wolff was incredulous on the radio, demanding the last lap be reinstated. 
“Toto, it’s called a motor race,” Masi tersely replied. “We want car racing.”
Hamilton received a long hug from his father, who then went to the Red Bull garage and hugged both Verstappen and Verstappen’s father. Jos Verstappen was himself a former F1 driver and raised his 24-year-old son to become a world champion. 
Mission accomplished and Red Bull celebrated by playing ‘We are the Cham­pions’ in its garage.",Newspaper

"JI, PSP blame PPP for promoting ethnic politics over new LG law
","December 13, 2021","KARACHI: The Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) and Pak Sarzameen Party (PSP) on Sunday agreed that the Pakistan Peoples Party government was promoting ethnic politics in the province that would have “devastative consequences”.
The two parties also observed that the recently 
 Sindh Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2021 would further widen the rural-urban divide in the province and ignite hatred among people.
The consensus emerged during a meeting between JI-Karachi chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman and PSP chairman Syed Mustafa Kamal at the former’s Idara Noor-i-Haq headquarters. PSP president Anis Kaimkhani and others were also present.
Talking to reporters after the meeting, JI’s Hafiz Naeem said that his party was willing and open to take on board every political stakeholder against the PPP’s policies in Sindh.
 
“The PPP always chants the mantra of the constitution but now it has attempted to violate the same constitution. The ruling party recently bulldozed all rules of business in the Sindh Assembly. The Jamaat demands an empowered local government set-up for Karachi. The PPP should have returned the institutions taken away from the local governments,” he said.
He warned that the PPP’s moves had been legalising the politics of hatred and creating a rural-urban divide.
Speaking on the occasion, PSP leader Kamal endorsed the JI chief’s thoughts and said more than five years ago he had warned that certain parties would again exploit ethnic politics for their petty gains.
“I see the LG law as a gateway to the politics of ethnicity and hatred,” he said. “We already have suffered a lot due to this hatred and divide. This law would revive it. You are not making a law, but signing a document to create new terrorists.”
He said that the chief minister had seized all the monetary resources and powers to themselves in a sheer violation of the Constitution and against the spirit of the 18th Amendment.
“Until the powers and resources are taken away from the chief ministers and passed on to the people at street level, the integrity of Pakistan will be in jeopardy. The state must stop the PPP before it’s too late. Sindh province is not the dynasty of the PPP,” said Mr Kamal.",Pakistan

"ADB-funded projects to benefit 3.5m people in five KP cities
","December 13, 2021","PESHAWAR: Following its funding for Peshawar Bus Rapid Transit project, Asian Development Bank’s Rs98 billion loan to improve municipal services in five divisional headquarters of the province is second high volume financing by the same lender.
ADB has provided Rs53 billion for Peshawar BRT project.
Earlier on Friday, the Manila-based ADB had announced $385 million for improvement of municipal services in five divisional headquarters of the province including Peshawar, Abbottabad, Kohat, Mardan and Mignora under KP Cities Improvement Project (KPCIP)
The financing will be spent on improvement of water supply systems, sewerage and drainage including sewerage treatment plants, provision of integrated solid waste management systems and development of green urban spaces in all the five cities.
The secretary of local government and rural development department, Shakeel Ahmed Mian, told Dawn that the Rs98 billion loan would be utilised over a period of five years. He said that the loan would be utilised for several projects in five divisional headquarters of the province.
The official said that the loan would be spent to develop municipal urban infrastructure, water supply, sewerage treatment plants and solid waste management in those cities. He said that his department fast tracked several projects and work on them was likely to start from January or February next.
Executive Committee of National Economic Council (Ecnec) had approved KPCIP on November 24.
ADB said that the financing would benefit more than 3.5 million people in five cities from improved access to clean and safe water, reliable and integrated waste management and sanitation service, green urban spaces and gender friendly facilities. 
“About 150,000 households will get new connections to water supply system and have smart water meters installed in their homes,” it said.
According to details available on the ADB website, several projects including a 93-kanal park in Phase-VII of Hayatabad Township of Peshawar, women business development centre in Kohat, Mardan Ring Road greenbelt, Mingora greater water supply scheme and surface water treatment plant, extension of water treatment plant and water supply scheme in Abbottabad, development of Shimal Hill park in Abbottabad, development of Bagh Naran park in Hayatabad Peshawar, and solid waste management facilities will be executed in all five cities under the umbrella of the KPCIP.
In Peshawar, Besai Park would be set up on an area of 4.7 hactares or 93 kanals of land in Phase-VII of Hayatabad on the bank of Gandao Khawar. According to documents, it has the potential to be developed as a park with multi-purpose walking tracks, sports facilities and spaces for families.
“Designed for access through walking, public transport and private cars, the park will serve up to 189,049 residents in its immediate vicinity as well as other visitors from Peshawar city,” the document said.
Under the Mingora greater water supply scheme and surface water treatment plant, surface water from the Swat River will be provided to the district headquarters of Swat through gravity based transmission system of 20 kilometres length.
Besides, a water treatment plant has been proposed to be constructed at the left bank of the Swat River about 20 kilometres upstream of Mingora city.
Under the Shimla Hill park project in Abbottbad, an urban forest and public park would be set up at Shimla Hill. The park would be set up over an area of 87.5 acres of land to the west of popular Shimla Pahari. The site of the project would be distributed between an urban forest spread over 46.25 acres and park with viewing decks over an area of five acres. “The remaining space will remain the same and existing natural features will be conserved,” said the document.

","December 13, 2021","The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday deferred till December 20 the framing of charges in a contempt of court case against former chief justice of Gilgit-Baltistan Rana Shamim and three others, related to the 
 of an affidavit attributed to the ex-judge in which he accused former jurist Mian Saqib Nisar of colluding to deny bails to top PML-N leadership prior to the general elections 2018. 
The court again directed Shamim to submit the original affidavit, having previously directed him to submit it in hearings on November 30 and December 7.
In a written order on December 10, IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah had 
 that charges would be framed if the maker of the affidavit, Shamim, the publisher and editor-in-chief of Jang Group Mir Shakeelur Rehman, senior journalist Ansar Abbasi and resident editor Amer Ghouri failed to show it was executed and published for bona fide purpose.
Justice Minallah had issued the order after going through the reply submitted by Shamim in which he explained reasons for executing the statement on oath — dated November 10, 2021. 
In the 'leaked' affidavit, on which Ansar Abbasi's 
 was based, Shamim allegedly stated that Nisar during his visit to GB made a call to an IHC judge and asked him to ensure that former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz are not released on bail before July 25, 2018 general elections. The affidavit was published as part of an investigative report by 
.
Justice Minallah had subsequently taken notice of the report and later issued show-cause notices to Abbasi, Rehman, Ghouri as well as Shamim under the Contempt of Court Ordinance.
Shamim, Abbasi, Ghouri and Attorney General of Pakistan Khalid Jawed Khan were present during today's hearing. 
At the outset of the hearing, Justice Minallah questioned whether a newspaper would publish an affidavit given to it by somebody to ""tarnish the image"" of a judge. 
Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) secretary general Nasir Zaidi, who is an amicus curiae in the case, responded that it was a journalist's duty to publish a news report based on facts. 
""The sensationalism of the news gave an impression that judges take directions. It should also have been written that the judge [mentioned in the affidavit] was on leave in those days,"" Justice Minallah remarked. 
He further observed that news of sub judice cases could not be published. He recalled that Shamim had said he had not given the affidavit to anyone. 
When the PFUJ secretary general said the country's history was ""very harsh"", Justice Minallah asked him to not go into the past, remarking that he was only responsible for the Islamabad High Court.
The IHC chief justice said he would not listen to any ""political speeches"" and asked Zaidi to inform the court if there was a judgement related to the ongoing case regarding the affidavit. 
""The public's trust in this court has been damaged by one news [report],"" he said. 
Observing that the IHC was hearing a case related to a verdict of the International Court of Justice regarding Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav, Justice Minallah repeated that trust in the court was being damaged. 
""Rana Shamim says the notary public leaked the document. If his response is sent to the regulator in Britain then it can become a problem for the notary public,"" the judge said. 
Justice Minallah said that ""a lot of propaganda had been done against"" him in the past but he had never cared about it. ""The matter is different in [this case]. This is not about me but my court.
""I will not initiate contempt of court proceedings against anyone no matter what they say [against] me,"" he remarked. 
However, Justice Minallah said the court would not tolerate any attempt to undermine the provision of justice or public confidence. 
If somebody raised a matter after a gap of three years, they should have grounds for it, he said. ""Did you publish the news of this person (Shamim's) affidavit [without verification]?"" he asked journalist Ansar Abbasi. 
He added that he represented only the people and no judge was a stakeholder for him.
""This isn't just a case of contempt of court but this is my own accountability,"" Justice Minallah said, remarking that lies were becoming the truth and vice versa and no one could speak about it. 
""You can't spread mistrust in the high court like this. It can't be said that just because this has happened before so [the same] will happen now. This is the accountability of me and all my judges."" 
Attorney General Khan said that Shamim had admitted in his response that if he wanted to malign the judiciary then it would have been written in Pakistan and released to the media. ""Rana Shamim admitted that the purpose of leaking his affidavit was to ridicule the judiciary,"" the AG said, calling on the court to set a date for indictment. 
""Rana Shamim voiced concerns of affidavit being leaked after leaking it himself,"" he added. 
For his part, senior journalist Ansar Abbasi said Shamim had not stopped him from publishing the news of the affidavit. 
Justice Minallah asked him how much people's trust had been damaged due to his headline. 
""We have a motto that only the people are the stakeholders. If the people's trust is lost then nothing is left. Now the lie has become the truth and the truth seems a lie,"" he remarked to which Abbasi said: ""God willing, we will never stand with [a] lie."" 
Justice Minallah responded that the court would proceed in accordance with the law. 
""Ansar Abbasi 
, you should have seen that no appeal had been filed on July 15, 2018,"" the judge observed.
He was referring to the affidavit attributed to Shamim in which the ex-judge had mentioned former CJP Nisar's call with an IHC judge about not granting bail to Nawaz and Maryam in the Avenfield Apartment reference. 
""I know there are cases [based on] narratives,"" he said. ""You (Abbasi) have submitted your response. We will proceed according to international practices.""
The AG said there was a clear difference in Shamim and Abbasi's statements. He said Abbasi should submit a counter-affidavit against the affidavit attributed to Shamim. 
Abbasi only had to satisfy the court whether his news story was in accordance with the law or not, Justice Minallah said. 
The court directed the journalist to read the published news story and state whatever he wanted to say in the counter-affidavit.
Justice Minallah adjourned the hearing till December 20, directing Shamim to submit the original affidavit before that date. He also directed the other respondents to submit counter-affidavits. 
Shamim was bombarded with questions from reporters after the hearing, to which he only responded with ""no comments"".
In the last hearing on December 7, Shamim's counsel 
 to the court that the content of the affidavit attributed to his client was indeed accurate. 
He, however, added that the affidavit was not supposed to be published.
The counsel had also informed the court that the original affidavit was with Shamim's grandson, who was ""underground"" in the United Kingdom because he was being harassed.
Justice Minallah had then remarked that people did not go into hiding in the UK, adding that the high court was being ""targeted"" and the submission of the original affidavit was necessary for progress in the case.
Later that week, Shamim's name was 
 on the Provincial National Identification List (PNIL) — a 30-day temporary travel restriction introduced in 2018 as an alternative to the more tedious Exit Control List (ECL).
Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed had said at the time that Shamim's name had been placed on the PNIL ""so he doesn't run away"".",Pakistan
"Pakistan's first Omicron case confirmed through gene-sequencing
","December 13, 2021","The Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) confirmed on Monday that the new coronavirus variant Omicron has been detected in a patient through gene-sequencing. 
In a statement, the hospital said the patient was at home and doing well. So far, no other patients at the hospital have been confirmed to have the Omicron variant, it added. 
The National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) also confirmed that the Omicron variant has been detected. ""The National Institute of Health, Islamabad has been able to confirm that a recently suspected sample from Karachi is indeed the ‘Omicron variant’ of Sars-CoV2,"" it said in a tweet.
""This is the first confirmed case but continued surveillance of identified samples is in place to identify trends,"" the NCOC added.
			
On Dec 8, the Sindh government had 
 that though genomic study had to be done for confirmation, the way the virus was behaving in a female patient in Karachi seemed it was the Omicron. The matter was widely circulated in the media and reported as the first case of Omicron.
In a video message on the same day, Sindh Health Minister Dr Azra Pechuho had said the 57-year-old woman was unvaccinated. 
However, on Dec 9, the NIH issued a clarification stating that the sample was yet to be confirmed as Omicron through whole-genome sequencing, adding it would be obtained from the Sindh government.
It later 
 that results of samples of three suspected cases of Omicron variant of Covid-19 would be received on Monday (today). 
A day earlier, the World Health Organisation (WHO) 
 the Omicron coronavirus variant is more transmissible than the Delta strain and reduces vaccine efficacy but causes less severe symptoms according to early data.
The WHO said Omicron had spread to 63 countries as of December 9. Faster transmission was noted in South Africa, where Delta is less prevalent, and in Britain, where Delta is the dominant strain.
But it stressed that a lack of data meant it could not say if Omicron's rate of transmission was because it was less prone to immune responses, higher transmissibility or a combination of both.
Early evidence suggests Omicron causes ""a reduction in vaccine efficacy against infection and transmission"", the WHO said in a technical brief.
Omicron infections have so far caused ""mild"" illness or asymptomatic cases, but the WHO said the data was insufficient to establish the variant's clinical severity.
Last month, Federal Planning Minister Asad Umar and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Health Dr Faisal Sultan had 
, saying that the arrival of the Omicron variant was inevitable and a matter of time.
""This [strain] has to spread in the whole world as we saw before that when a variant comes, the world is so interconnected that it is impossible to stop it,"" Umar had said, adding that vaccination was the most logical solution to curb the threat.
On November 30, the Sindh government issued new 
 — applicable from December 1-15 — to curb Covid-19's transmission in wake of the threat posed by the new variant.
Pakistan had also placed a complete ban on November 27 on travel from six south African countries — South Africa, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique, Botswana and Namibia — and Hong Kong in the wake of the variant's discovery.
This 
 was later extended to nine more countries — Croatia, Hungary, Netherlands, Ukraine, Ireland, Slovenia, Vietnam, Poland and Zimbabwe.
Additionally, the NCOC placed 13 countries comprising United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Trinidad and Tobago, Azerbaijan, Mexico, Sri Lanka, Russia, Thailand, France, Austria, Afghanistan and Turkey in category B.",Pakistan
"National security more than just about military power, encompasses inclusive growth: PM Imran
","December 13, 2021","Prime Minister Imran Khan on Monday said that national security was more than just a matter of focusing on military might, adding that it encompassed inclusive growth as well. 
""We all know our focus was on military [power] but it (national security) is actually an all-encompassing thing. You can't have national security until there is inclusive growth,"" the premier said while addressing the opening session of the Margalla Dialogue 21 with the theme “Breaking Past, Entering Future”. 
He said no country could be secure where a small segment kept getting richer and those at the bottom were left behind — and the same applied to certain areas or cities developing while other parts of the country were left behind. 
He explained that such inequality became the basis for discord in society, adding that whenever people protested or there was violence then it had its roots in unequal development and injustice. 
""It is a very important issue of national security that how can we have equitable [and] inclusive development."" 
The prime minister said a similar focus was needed on human development as well and called upon the audience to highlight the issues in Pakistan's three-tiered education system. 
He lamented that three education systems were running in parallel in the country with English-medium, Urdu-medium and religious schools. ""Do we think there will be no fallout of this?"" he asked. 
He pointed out that English-medium schools were subject to further segmentation, while Urdu-medium schools had seen a decline in quality and there was a lack of job opportunities for students of religious schools.
Prime Minister Imran attributed the above imbalance to lack of research in the country and reliance on second-hand research from abroad. ""This is why it is important to have an all-encompassing national security dialogue,"" he stressed. 
The premier hoped that more think tanks would be established in Pakistan that competed with each other in quality of research and global credibility. ""Then we will be able to properly put our national narrative in front of people,"" he said. 
He lamented that since the Salman Rushdie affair, foreign media and think tanks concentrated on Pakistan's extremes and generalised the whole society. ""If you concentrate on any society's extremes then you will say a lot of bad things about it,"" he added. 
He held the ""unjust"" three-tiered education system as being majorly responsible for the extremes in Pakistani society since it produced three groups that had no connection with each other. 
""I expect that now the time has come to research, bring original thought and define our country instead of someone from outside doing it. The more the credibility of your think tanks increases, the easier it will be for us to define ourselves in the world."" 
However, Prime Minister Imran said the problem of a lack of narratives was not unique to Pakistan. He pointed out that there was a lack of think tanks in the rest of the Muslim world which could respond to criticism or Islamophobia. 
He regretted that Muslims in the West had to face hardships but there was no response from the Islamic world's leadership. 
""If there were think tanks in the Muslim world then they would have taken up the issue [of atrocities in Indian-occupied Kashmir]. It is our misfortune the kind of racist government is there [in India] and the fascist policies it has and what it is doing with its minorities and especially in Kashmir. 
""Unfortunately there are no think tanks in our Muslim world that can project this issue,"" he said. ",Pakistan
"At least one dead from Omicron as UK boosts response
","December 13, 2021","At least one person has died in Britain after being infected with the Omicron variant, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday, as the country launched an ambitious Covid booster shot programme to stop the virus' spread.
Britain — among the countries worst hit by the global health crisis since last year — is believed to be the first government to officially announce a death from the virus mutation.
On a visit to a vaccination centre in west London, Johnson said Omicron accounted for about 40 per cent of the cases in the British capital, and hospital admissions were rising.
“Sadly, at least one patient has been confirmed to have died with Omicron,” he told reporters, a day after warning the country was facing a “tidal wave” of infection.
Britain on Sunday sounded the alarm by raising the national Covid Alert Level because of high levels and rising rates of transmission.
In a rare televised address, Johnson said emergency measures were needed to prevent hospitals becoming overwhelmed in the weeks ahead.
All adults will now be able to receive a third dose of a Covid vaccine by the end of December after the government brought forward its deadline by one month.
But in a sign of huge demand, the National Health Service (NHS) vaccination booking site crashed and users requesting rapid testing kits were told they were out of stock.
			
Long queues were seen at London clinics. At one, Sarah Jackson, 29, said she had taken the morning off to get a jab before visiting her grandparents at Christmas.
“I don't know if it's going to be enough. I was told there is a queue of two hours to register and then two hours to get vaccinated,” she told 
.
“But I have to go back to work at 1:30pm.” 
The “turbocharged” booster programme has seen military planners asked to set up and run extra vaccination centres around the clock.
Some 500,000 booster jabs were given on Saturday but to hit the new deadline that number will have to be doubled every day for the remainder of the year to slow the spread.
Concerns have mounted about a new wave because of indications that two jabs are less effective against infection than three.
There were 1,239 confirmed cases of the variant recorded on Sunday and scientists have said numbers are doubling every two to three days.
Vaccination rates are high in Britain, with more than 81pc or 46.7 million of those aged 12 and over having had a second jab.
Some 23 million or 40pc have so far had a booster.
The new measures come after face masks were made compulsory in indoor public spaces last Friday, and new testing and self-isolation rules for contact cases began on Monday.
Workers were also told to stay at home, leading to a quieter-than-usual Monday morning rush hour.
Vaccine passports for certain crowded settings, including at football grounds, are due to be enforced from Wednesday.
The rules apply to England only. The devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, which are responsible for health policy, have similar measures.
The race to vaccinate the nation will come at the cost of already delayed elective surgeries, like hip or knee operations, the government admitted.
Johnson's intervention on Sunday sought to refocus attention on the pandemic, after a torrid week in which he and staff were accused of breaking Covid rules last year.
Claims of illegal Christmas parties at Downing Street and across government departments have been seen as undermining public health messaging.
Johnson is also facing a large rebellion from within his Conservative party at a vote in parliament to make the new rules law on Tuesday.
Many Tory MPs are unhappy that freedoms are being restricted again — and even cut further. The vote, though, is likely to pass with opposition Labour support.",World

"Despite UAE law change, unwed mothers still fighting to obtain birth certificates for their babies
","December 13, 2021","Over a dozen unmarried women huddled in a jail cell south of Dubai last year, locked up for the crime of giving birth, when a guard entered and declared them free.
The incident, described by one of the women, was among the first concrete signs that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) had 
 in an overhaul of its Islamic penal code.
But a year later, these unwed mothers remain trapped in limbo, fighting to obtain birth certificates for babies born in the shadows.
A new law that comes into effect in two weeks still does not offer unmarried women a clear path to acquiring birth certificates for their babies. At the same time, the law criminalises women lacking such documents.
: 
Although unwed mothers no longer face jail after the UAE legalised premarital sex in November 2020, they now face a maze of red tape.
Obtaining birth certificates for their babies is a costly process that the country’s poorest residents — foreign workers who clean offices, serve food and care for the children of other mothers — cannot afford. Expats outnumber locals by nearly nine to one in the Emirates.
“We were so full of hope,” said Star, one of those released from Sharjah Central Jail in December 2020 with her 3-month-old daughter. “Then came trouble I didn’t think I’d have the strength to get through.”
Star gave only her first name for fear of reprisals. She and six other unmarried women, most of them Filipinas, described their legal battles to 
.
Before last year’s law change, several had given birth at hospitals, where health authorities denied them birth certificates and called the police. Others withdrew to their shared apartments, scared and alone, to have their babies.
In the UAE, hospitals issue birth certificates only to married parents. Without the certificates, children are unable to receive medical care, attend school or travel.
Their mothers, who lost work and residency during prosecution under the old law, become stranded. The number of undocumented children in the UAE is not known.
Lawyers say the obstacles stem from an enduring conservative mindset and lack of government coordination.
Some women even yearn for the previous punishment, typically one-year detention and deportation. While terrifying, it at least guaranteed a flight home and identity documents for their children.
“It has only gotten harder since the law changed,” said 25-year-old mother Sitte Honey. “They won’t take you to jail and they don’t want you to give birth,” she added, noting abortion is also forbidden. “We’re stuck.”
Dirar Belhoul Al Falasi, a member of the UAE’s advisory Federal National Council, argued last year’s decriminalisation had an impact.
“Prior to this, there was nothing in my hand to legalise what they have,” he told the 
. “But now, there is a law […] that we can help them with.”
Under a new law that comes into force on Jan 2, parents who fail to document their children face a minimum of two years in prison.
It makes no reference to health authorities issuing birth certificates to single mothers. The law demands that parents marry or acquire travel documents and other paperwork to prove their children’s identities, without detailing how.
That has stoked panic among unmarried mothers who fear further punishment.
Last year, as lawyers scrambled to understand the opaque legal code, women like Star walked out of jail across the country. Conditions at the facilities varied and in some, mothers were separated from their children.
Star said her daughter was taken from her during detention. She said 15 women shared a single bathroom, subsisted on only rice and bread and were let out 30 minutes each day for fresh air. Other women described police interrogations about their sexual history as deeply humiliating.
But after these women were freed, they still couldn’t get the one thing they wanted most: identity documents.
Maya, a 36-year-old mother, turned herself into authorities in November 2020 when she heard it would help her get a birth certificate for her one-year-old. After several torturous weeks in Dubai’s Al Qusais Police Station, authorities became alerted to the law change and freed her.
But they never granted legal status to her daughter, forcing her to ricochet from one government office to another in her quest.
“These massive fundamental changes are highly welcome, but so much still needs to catch up,” said Ludmila Yamalova, managing partner of LYLAW, a firm taking on cases of unwed mothers.
“Emotionally and mentally, people are not prepared to accept the law as reality,” she added, referring to health and law enforcement agencies.
Women continue to raise undocumented children in secret. Noraida Gamama, desperate to document her three-year-old daughter, has plastered the door of her Sharjah apartment with signs warning her half-dozen roommates to check the peephole before answering to ensure it’s not a government official.
Living on expired visas and struggling to feed infants on wisps of income, many can’t afford court fees and lawyers’ bills. It costs over $350 to open a birth certificate petition case independently at Dubai’s Family Court.
Ann, 36, works multiple part-time jobs, sleeping a few hours a night, to feed her undocumented two-year-old girl. She recounted the agony of delivering her on the floor of a rented Dubai room.
“All I want is to give her a name, to bring her back to the Philippines where she could live a better life,” Ann said.
Still, a growing number of women are taking their cases to court, with mixed success. A clerk at one Dubai court said the system handled over 50 “baby cases” daily.
When Honey discovered she was pregnant with her boyfriend’s child two years ago, she appealed to the Philippine Consulate to send her home. But while waiting for help that never came, baby Naya was born in her tiny apartment.
Lacking legal status after fleeing abusive employers who confiscated her passport, Honey has grown desperate to get out of Dubai. But authorities cannot repatriate her until Naya gets papers.
“This is a nightmare. No money, no visa, no rent, no plan,” Honey said.
To hasten her return, Honey’s 47-year-old mother moved to Qatar as a housemaid, pulling together the money needed to open a case in Dubai last month. She’s still waiting for her first hearing and trying to get a written acknowledgement of paternity from her ex-boyfriend.
The process requires an unwed mother to provide a ream of personal documents, take a DNA test and testify before a judge. If the judge approves, the mother may request her child’s birth certificate.
Some, like Star, have persevered and made it through.
“That kind of joy is overwhelming, to know your daughter is not illegal anymore,” Star said from her family’s home in Davao City, Philippines. “It’s like I’m breathing for the first time.”",World
"Alarm over rupee devaluation in Dubai
","December 19, 2021","KARACHI: Hawala operators in Dubai are selling the dollar for Rs187-89 (at a premium of three to four per cent compared to rates in Pakistan), resulting in a decline in the official remittances from Pakistanis working in the United Arab Emirates.  
In Pakistan, the dollar was trading at around Rs181 in the open market compared to Rs178 in the inter-bank market on Friday.   
Local exchange companies say the dollar rate in Dubai is considered the real value of the currency in Pakistan, particularly in the open market. 
: 
The open market usually sells the greenback at Rs2-3 higher than the inter-bank market. 
“There is a big gap in dollar prices in Dubai and Pakistan. Dubai-based hawala operators have been selling the US currency at Rs187-89, attracting a lot of Pakistanis to remit their income through the system,” said Zafar Paracha, the general secretary of the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan.  
He said the Pakistani market could consider the exchange rate as the real one, which may lead to further devaluation of the rupee.  
The State Bank could not be reached for comment.  
Hawala money transfer businesses work under a system that allows customers to rapidly move large sums across borders outside the scrutiny of regulators.  
The trust-based money transfer system has long been the banking system of choice for many people in Pakistan, but many businesses are unregulated and once the money has left the country it is hard to keep track of it. 
Worryingly for the government, remittances from Pakistanis living in Dubai have been on the wane since July amid growing hawala use.  
Official data shows that remittance from Dubai stood at $530.6m in July, $512.3m in August, $502m in September, $455.9m in October, and $452.5m in November. 
One reason behind an expensive dollar in Dubai is that people from Afghanistan and some Central Asian countries are paying Pakistani exporters in dollars purchased from hawala operators. 
Pakistani exporters buying goods for an Afghan importer have to deposit the entire amount of dollars equal to the exportable goods in a Pakistani bank. The exporters buy dollars from the local currency market, which is cheaper than Dubai, and deposit in a Pakistani bank. 
In fact, Afghanis are making their payments to Pakistani exporters in rupees at the rate of Rs187-189 instead of dollars.  
“Afghanistan and Central Asian countries have been doing it because they have no dollars,” said Malik Bostan, the chairman of the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan. 
He said he has recently briefed the high-ups in the government, including Adviser to the Prime Minister on Finance and Revenue Shaukat Tarin, about the alarming situation since the illegal system of transactions is getting stronger. 
“Previously, we used to buy foreign currencies equal to $10 to $12 million daily, but it has now shrunk to just $3-4m. These currencies are officially taken to Dubai to bring back the dollar equal to the value of foreign currencies,” he said, adding that it has deprived the country of a reasonable amount of the US currency. 
“I have alarmed the authorities that if this isn’t stopped, the country may lose up to $2 billion in remittances in the near future,” Mr Bostan said.",Newspaper
"Pakistan’s Covid-19 mortality rate much higher than global rate
","December 19, 2021","•  Task Force member says citizens visit hospitals after developing complications

•  Poor health, diagnostic facilities another reason for high number of deaths
 Though health experts have been claiming that Covid-19 has proved less lethal among Asians, global data shows that Pakistan’s mortality rate is far higher than many regions.
Member of the Scientific Task Force on Covid-19 Dr Javed Akram was of the view that more Pakistanis died beca­use they visited hospitals due to complications arising from Covid-19 rather than the infection itself. He also blamed poor health and diagnostic facilities for the high number of casualties. 
A document of the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC), available with 
, said the coronavirus mortality rate of Pakistan was 2.24 per cent against 1.97pc globally. It further showed that 28,870 deaths were reported across the country, out of which 61pc were males and 39pc females.
The minimum age of a Pakistani national who succumbed to the infection was two months and the maximum age was over 100 years, with the median age calculated at 62 years, the document revealed.
Out of the total number of deaths, 78pc were over the age of 50; 69pc had chronic comorbidity; and 91pc of the deceased were hospitalised with an average stay of 6.6 days (ranging from one day to 173 days). Similarly, 45pc of the hospitalised patients remained on ventilators with an average stay of 3.2 days (ranging from one day to 42 days).
The document showed that 172 deaths were reported among health staff, out of whom 103 were doctors, one was a medical student, four were nurses and 64 were paramedics.
Talking to 
, Dr Akram accepted that far more patients lost their lives in Pakistan compared to global percentage of deaths.
“Unfortunately in Pakistan people do not visit hospitals with Covid-19; rather they visit hospitals once they develop complications. Besides, we lack state-of-the-art health and diagnostic facilities,” he said, adding “our intensive care units remained under pressure or were overburdened due to which mortality ratio increased”.
When it was pointed out that the government had claimed 100pc ventilators were never occupied in Pakistan, Dr Akram said although there were the same kinds of people and economic conditions in Italy and France, more casualties were reported in Italy.
Dr Akram, who is also the vice chancellor of the Uni­versity of Health Sciences, said the situation might deteriorate across the globe in winter as 2.5 million people die of pneumonia every year in the cold season.
Meanwhile, the NCOC data showed that seven people died of coronavirus and 357 more tested positive in the last 24 hours. As many as 728 patients were admitted to hospitals across the country.",Pakistan

 there was a need to ease up the wind-up procedures for the companies. “The wind-up procedure has to be easy, but at the same time there has to be protection for investors and minority shareholders,” he said. 
The number of company registration has increased significantly in the past three years witnessing a growth of more than 60 per cent, from 93,000 in December 2018. The main reason for the rapid growth in the registration of new companies is the end-to-end digitisaion facility available for company formation. 
“Now any company can be established within a day, without any paperwork, and even the registration certificate is delivered online,” Mr Khan said.",Newspaper
"SNGPL seeks Ogra’s nod for spending Rs46.5bn on uplift projects
","December 19, 2021","LAHORE: The Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) has asked the Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) to allow it to spend Rs46.525 billion for execution of several development schemes, including 300,000 new gas connections to domestic consumers during the ongoing fiscal year (FY22) ending on June 30, 2022. 
The SNGPL has also sought permission for executing two mega projects worth Rs2.946bn on 100 per cent cost sharing basis during FY22, 
 has learnt. 
“In the company’s estimated revenue requirement (ERR), it was planned to provide 1.2 million new connections during the FY22. However, later, through the Review of Estimated Revenue Requirement (RERR 2021-22), it was decided to at least provide new connections to the consumers, who have already paid requisite fees (including urgent cases). Those who have already paid fees are approximately 275,000,” an official source explained while talking to 
 on Saturday. 
According to a document made available to 
, the company plans to lay pipelines for the provision of Regasified Liquefied Natural Gas (RLNG) to industries, housing schemes, colonies and other major consumers. The cost to be incurred on these schemes has been estimated as Rs2.400bn that would be exclusively provided by the private sector (sponsors/owners of the projects). Similarly, the company would also lay a pipeline network for the provision of 10mmcfd RLNG to Bhalwal Industrial City (Special Economic Zone). Rs546m to be incurred on this scheme would be paid by the respective departments. 
The document mentions laying of new pipelines (5,000 kilometers) in various parts of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for Rs19.073bn by the SNGPL with its own expense, laying of pipelines (300 km long) in small streets for Rs767m, 135km long system augmentation for Rs1.201bn, laying and fitting of new pipes for Rs720m, installation of 300,000 new connections for Rs5.235bn, schemes related to system rehabilitation for Rs4.307bn, schemes related to monitoring of UFG (Unaccounted for Gas) losses for Rs3.345bn, carrying out UFG control activities for Rs730m, transportation for Rs200m, augmentation/bifurcation of gas network in Lahore City (Phase-II) for Rs2.363bn, Charsadda-Khazana-Tangi transmission system augmentation (Phase-II) for Rs826m, Compression Overhaul Project (2021-26) for Rs533m and other schemes/activities for Rs7.225bn. 
“With the completion of the aforementioned schemes, the SNGPL’s gas pipeline network would be expanded as well as strengthened,” the official said, adding that the backlog of those seeking new gas connections has reached to around 3.5m applications. 
He said the company is trying hard to provide new connections at maximum. The backlog continues to increase due to annual addition of a hundreds of thousands of new applicants seeking new gas connections, he added.",Newspaper
"Catalans protest against mandate for more Spanish in schools
","December 19, 2021","BARCELONA: Thousands of Catalans took to the streets of Barcelona on Saturday to protest against a court decision that mandates that 25pc of all school subjects be taught in Spanish, reducing the still predominant use of the local Catalan language in classrooms.
Demonstrators say this would threaten their cherished educational system, which has helped bring Catalan back to common use after it had been suppressed during the 20th-century dictatorship of Gen Francisco Franco.
It is not proper of a democracy that a court invalidates an educational system that is supported by society and its parliament, said scar Escuder, president of Platform for the Language, a grassroots group that promotes the use of Catalan who joined the march. According to our polls, 82pc of Catalans support the current system.
The renewed defence of the Catalan language also promises to galvanise the region’s separatist movement that has been struggling to maintain its unity. Several marchers carried pro-independence flags, and the movement’s leaders were in attendance. 
But families who want their children to receive more learning in Spanish say the current system is violating their rights to study in the nations common tongue.
The march comes less than a month since Spain’s Supreme Court upheld the 2020 decision by a lower court in Catalonia that ruled in favour on a suit brought by the Spain’s previous conservative government against Catalonia’s Department of Education.
The Supreme Court tossed out an appeal by the Catalan government against the previous ruling that the region’s schools must guarantee at least 25pc of academic subjects be taught in Spanish. That would translate into roughly doubling the hours Catalan student are taught in Spanish from one subject to two. Currently, most schools only use Spanish in Spanish language class, leaving everything else to be taught in Catalan.",Newspaper

","December 19, 2021","KARACHI: Federal Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Asad Umar on Saturday said that foreign investors had shown keen interest to become part of the Karachi Circular Railway project and the government was considering all possible options before picking up the best to complete it in two years.
Addressing a ceremony to mark the restoration and revamping of Mahmoodabad Nullah, he said that the completion of the major drain under the Prime Minister’s Rs1.1 trillion Karachi Transformation Plan was a reflection of the federal government’s commitment for development of the metropolis.
“When the Karachi Transformation Plan was announced in September 2020, we marked three nullahs for restoration to modernise the city’s drainage system and keep it safe from urban flooding during rains,” he said. 
“This Mahmoodabad nullah is one of them and the work is also under progress on two others drains — Orangi Nullah and Gujjar Nullah. So Karachiites should know that all the projects under the KTP including freight corridor, water supply through K-IV and KCR would be completed within the stipulated time,” he said.

"LDA hands over 122 kanals to health department for hospital
","December 19, 2021","LAHORE: The Lahore Development Authority (LDA) has handed over the possession of  its 122 kanal land which once housed the Kot Lakhpat fruit and vegetable market to the Specialised Healthcare and  Medical Education Department (SH&MED) for construction of a 100-bed  hospital.  
The authority did this after it sold the land,  situated at prime location of Ferozepur Road near Arfa Karim Technology  Park, to the department for over Rs2 billion, 
 has learnt.  
After the 2011 shifting the business to the newly-established fruit and vegetable market in Kaacha  village near Hadiara drain on Ferozepur Road, various organisations representing public and  private sector showed interest in procuring this precious chunk of land,  but the LDA didn’t sold it to anyone.  
However, it found  a proposal of the specialised healthcare department to buy the land  ‘reasonable.’ According to LDA, its governing body in its meeting held  in August this year finally accorded an approval to transfer physical possession to the department, subject to depositing of Rs2.033bn  with authority’s bank account before Feb 1, 2022.  
Accordingly,  the department, through its planning officer, submitted in writing  pledging that the cost of land would be deposited with the LDA accounts  soon after receiving funds from the Punjab government.  
“Since issuance  of allotment is mandatory before the physical possession, the case was  submitted to the LDA DG for issuance of the allotment letter to the  department subject to confirmation/ratification by the LDA governing  body after depositing of Rs2.033bn, approval of building plan from the  building control authority along with allied NOCs from the relevant  departments and restriction of the use of land for the purpose of  hospital alone and if there is any amendment required in the plan (use  of land for other purposes), it should be done by the respective  authority,” read minutes of a recent meeting of the LDA governing body.
The department was  further asked to not sublet the land to others or sub-divide it without  getting requisite NOCs. After fulfilling all conditions by the  department, the LDA recently issued allotment letter and handed over  physical possession of the land to the department.
“The authority  confirms the allotment and delivery of physical possession of the land  to the department, near Arfa Karim Technology Park,” reads the decision  of the authority taken in the governing body meeting.  
It merits mentioning that clashes had broken out in July 2011 between  traders  and officials of the then respective town municipal  administration when a  team along with the police launched a grand  operation to get 122 kanal  land (housing the Kot Lakhpat fruit and vegetable  market) vacated in line  with shifting the businesses to the  newly-established market.  
The TMA team and  police had faced immense  resistance from traders during the operation.  The protesters had also  thrashed some of the officials besides setting a  TMA truck on fire and  damaging another vehicle. They had also pelted  the police and TMA  officials with stones, leaving more than a dozen  injured.
They had blocked Ferozepur Road by setting used tyres  ablaze, throwing  traffic out of gear for almost three hours besides  chanting slogans  against the town administration and demanding action  against the  officials involved in torturing the traders. They were of  the view that  before shifting the existing market, the government should  have  provided all necessary facilities at the new site. The police had  also  launched a baton charge to disperse the protesters, leaving some of   them injured.  
They arrested over 100 protesters besides   registering cases against 500 or so on the complaint of the Gulberg TMO.
Since the protests by traders continued for a couple of months in  2011,  they finally shifted to the new place and the LDA took possession  of  its land.",Pakistan

"England crumble again to give Aussies complete control
","December 19, 2021","ADELAIDE: England were staring down the barrel of another sorry defeat on Saturday, dismissed for 236 then forced to watch as Australia batted again and stretched their lead in the day-night second Ashes Test in Adelaide.
Joe Root and Dawid Malan had survived the opening session of day three unscathed, building a 128-run stand as they chased Australia’s imposing first-innings 473 for nine declared.
But it all came crashing down after the dinner break with both players removed in quick succession, Root for 62 and Malan for 80, sparking a collapse that saw England slump from 150 for two to 236 all out.
Making matters worse, they did so against a second-string attack with Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood both missing.
Stand-in Australian skipper Steve Smith could have enforced the follow-on, but chose to rest his bowlers and send in the openers to turn the screw with two days left.
They negotiated some 75 minutes for the loss of David Warner for 13, needlessly run out after a disastrous mix-up with Marcus Harris, who remains unbeaten on 21.
Nightwatchman Michael Neser was on two as Australia reached 45 for one, building their lead to 282.
Hostile pace from Mitchell Starc and Nathan Lyon’s dangerous spin did the damage to England, complemented by Cameron Green, who bagged Root for the second consecutive time.
Starc claimed 4-37 and Lyon 3-58.
No bowler enjoys using the pink ball as much as the left-armer Starc. His record now  stands at 50 wickets 18 ahead of next-best Josh Hazlewood at an average  of 18.10 in day-night Tests.
“We’ve got a bit of a luxury of having  played eight Tests and [six] have been here,” Starc said. “I don’t think  Ive nailed it. But we’ve all got a certain plan to it.” 
Malan said Root and himself should have carried on.
“It’s pretty frustrating and disappointing — to lose two wickets like we did on Friday night, then get ourselves back into a position where we could get within touching distance of them,” said Malan. “Ultimately Rooty or myself should have gone on and got a big hundred.”
England crashed by nine wickets in the first Test at Brisbane and if they go 2-0 down in Adelaide the Ashes are as good as gone, needing to win all three remaining Tests.
Australia bowled repeat maidens at the start of the second session and Root looked increasingly uncomfortable against Green, who was starting to find movement with the pink ball.
Having passed 1,600 Test runs in a calendar year — only the fourth player in history to do so — Root poked at a Green delivery and got an edge to Smith at slip, leaving him still searching for an elusive first-ever century in Australia.
Malan soon followed, slashing at a Starc thunderbolt that took a nick, again into Smith’s safe hands. Malan has now scored nine Test 50s but only converted one into a century.
“We let it meander a little bit through the first session,” Starc said, while heaping praise on all-rounder Green.
“He’s a serious talent for a young kid, he’s a great addition to our bowling attack, he was extremely good in that session after the break.”
Starc added:  “We hold all the cards in terms of when we want to bowl and how big a lead we want to have, we’ve certainly got a few options on the table.”
Like in Brisbane, England’s batting folded. Ollie Pope survived a bat-pad review but only lasted two more balls, charging down the wicket to Lyon and edging to Marnus Labuschagne at short leg on five.
Jos Buttler fell without scoring to Starc and England trudged off to tea on 197 for six.
It didn’t take long for Australia to clean up the rest with Chris Woakes and Ollie Robinson also undone by Lyon, and when Ben Stokes was bowled by Green for 34, it was all but over.
England had resumed at 17 for two after losing openers Rory Burns (four) and Haseeb Hameed (six) to a fiery 40-minute spell from Starc, Neser and Jhye Richardson under lights on Friday evening.
Root strode out on five, alongside Malan on one.
They had perfect early batting conditions on a flat Adelaide pitch and Root settled, slamming a well-timed drive for four to boost his confidence.
Starc was hit for 11 off his first over and the pair quickly brought up their 50 partnership.
Malan completed his 50 with a single off Neser, while Root hit Richardson to the boundary to reach his 52nd half-century.

"Man beaten to death in India for attempted 'sacrilege' at Golden Temple
","December 19, 2021","A man was beaten to death in India for allegedly trying to commit an act of sacrilege at the Golden Temple, the holiest shrine of the Sikh faith.
Local media reported that the unidentified man jumped over a railing into the temple's inner sanctum during Saturday evening prayers in the northern city of Amritsar.
Broadcaster NDTV 
 the man tried to grab a sword kept in front of the Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh holy book, when he was stopped by worshippers and later beaten to death.
Punjab state chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi condemned the man's “most unfortunate and heinous act” in a series of tweets from his office late Saturday.
Channi also ordered a probe to find out the “underlying motive and real conspirators behind the dastardly act.” Defence of the Guru Granth Sahib and Sikh shrines against desecration is a highly sensitive issue for the community.
Former Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards in 1984 after she ordered a brutal army assault on the Golden Temple to flush out separatists.
Her killing sparked a bloody pogrom in the capital New Delhi which left nearly 3,000 Sikhs dead.
In 2015, a controversial biopic of Sikhism's founder Guru Nanak was pulled after protests prompted by his depiction in human form, which is against the tenets of the religion.

"Imran nominates new PTI office-bearers at centre, provinces
","December 26, 2021","ISLAMABAD: A day after 
 the party’s organisational structure across the country, Prime Minister Imran Khan on Saturday nominated new office-bearers of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) at the central and provincial levels reviving the eight-year-old party structure.  
Mr Khan in his capacity as chairman of the party has appointed federal Minister for Planning and Development Asad Umar as central secretary general in place of MNA Aamer Mehmood Kiani, who has been made additional secretary general.  
The nominations were announced by federal Minister for Information Fawad Chaudhry through his official social media account on Twitter.  
			
According to Mr Chaudhry, federal Minister for Education and Professional Training Shafqat Mahmood has been made president of the party’s central Punjab chapter and federal Minister for Industries and Production Khusro Bakhtiar president of the PTI’s south Punjab chapter.  
Minister for Maritime Affairs Ali Zaidi has been made president of PTI Sindh whereas Defence Minister Pervez Khattak has been given the responsibility to reorganise the party in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa where the party recently suffered a defeat in the first phase of the local government elections. 
National Assembly Deputy Speaker Qasim Suri has been nominated as president of the PTI’s Balochistan chapter.  
After the general elections in 2013, the PTI had introduced new party structure under which Punjab and KP were divided into four regions each with no office-bearers at the province level. Later, the same structure based on regions was maintained in the new constitution adopted by the party in 2019 and Sindh and Balochistan were also divided into four regions.  
However, the new nominations show that Mr Khan has abolished the party’s organisational structure as given in the constitution and appointed office-bearers at the central and provincial level.   
There have been no changes in the party’s structures in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan chapters so far.  
Talking to 
, Mr Chaudhry said Imran Khan had made these nominations temporarily by using his special powers as the party chairman. He said this “interim set-up” would continue to function till the time the party had a new constitution for which a special constitutional committee had already been set up.  
The information minister said the first meeting of the constitution committee was held on Saturday which discussed the proposals for new constitution. He said the party found it necessary to amend the constitution after finding some loopholes in the previously agreed constitution.  
Soon after his nomination as the new secretary general of the PTI, Mr Umar tweeted that it was an “honour” for him to have a key position in the country’s largest political party.  
“Having an important position in Pakistan’s largest political party is an honour as well as a big responsibility. Under the leadership of Imran Khan and as per the expectations of the party workers and voters, the PTI will become more stronger,” tweeted Mr Umar, adding: “The workers of this party are its assets, the example of which is not found in any other party.”  
			
Similarly, Ali Zaidi in a tweet said he was “humbled by the faith” that the prime minister had shown in him and that he would try to live up to the expectations of all, especially PTI workers.  
“Together we will pull Sindh out of deprivation,” tweeted Mr Zaidi.  
			
The dissolution of previous PTI organisations had been announced by Mr Chaudhry in a press conference on Friday after a meeting of the party’s senior leadership that was presided over by the prime minister to review the party’s dismal performance in the local bodies elections in KP where the party has been ruling for more than eight years.  
In the meeting, Prime Minister Khan had constituted a 21-member committee to form a new structure of the party organisations and draft a new constitution.  
The committee comprises Pervez Khattak, Mahmood Khan, Murad Saeed, Asad Qaiser and Ali Amin Gandapur from KP; Fawad Chaudhry, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Hammad Azhar, Khusro Bakhtiar, Chaudhry Mohammad Sarwar, Saifullah Niazee, Amir Kayani and Sardar Usman Buzdar from Punjab; Mir Jan Mohammad Jamali and Qasim Suri from Balochistan, Imran Ismail and Ali Zaidi from Sindh and Asad Umar from Islamabad.  
Prime Minister Khan had blamed selection of wrong candidates for the party’s defeat in the first phase of the local government elections in KP and expressed the hope that the PTI would bounce back with strength in the second phase of the elections scheduled to be held next month. He had also claimed that he would himself monitor selection of party candidates for all LG polls to be held in the country in future.",Pakistan
"Termination of service on verbal order illegal: SC
","December 26, 2021","ISLAMABAD: No emplo­yer can terminate the services of its employees on mere verbal instructions without any written order containing explicit reasons or cause for termination, the Supreme Court has held. 
Authored by Justice Mohammad Ali Mazhar, a verdict issued by the apex court emphasised that there was no provision under the Labour Laws or the Service Laws permitting the employer to terminate the services verbally without a written order containing “explicit reasons or cause of termination or for disciplinary proceedings on account of misconduct”. 
The judgement explained that a separate procedure had been laid down for proper termination of services, which accentuated the issuance of show-cause notice, holding of inquiry unless dispensed with by the competent authority considering all attending circumstances of the case that too after personal hearing. 
Justice Mazhar observed that termination of service by a verbal order was alien to labour and service laws and also against the principle of good governance, which was a process of gauging whether the government, its departments/institutions and authorities were conducting their affairs lawfully and performing their duties honestly, conscientiously and transparently including their process of decision making in accordance with rules and regulations. 
The observation came on an appeal against the Sept 2, 2020 order of the Federal Service Tribunal (FST) that had directed the Agriculture Policy Institute (API) to reinstate Zulqarnain Ali as driver after setting aside ‘verbal termination order’.  
The Supreme Court bench that heard the matter comprised Chief Justice of Pakistan Gulzar Ahmed, Justice Mazhar Alam Khan Miankhel and Justice Mohammad Ali Mazhar. 
Initially, driver Zulqarnain Ali had been engaged on a daily wage basis in April 2011 for 89 days and the period was extended multiple times. Lastly, he was appointed on Jan 11, 2012 by the API chairman through an office order of the deputy director (admin) along with four other persons on a daily wage basis for a period of 89 days. 
The judgement recalled that a May 31, 2012 minutes of the cabinet sub-committee convened for dealing with the cases for Regularisation of Contract and Daily Wages Employees performing their duties in the different ministries, divisions, attached departments, autonomous bodies and organisations in the establishment division and after due deliberation, the cabinet sub-committee decided and approved the regularization of their services. 
Subsequently the services of 38 contract employees and 16 daily wage earners of the food security and research ministry, 275 daily wage earners of the National Agricultural Research Centre (NARC) and 77 daily wage workers of the Pakistan Agriculture Research Council were regularized, subject to availability of posts on non-development budget and fulfillment of recruitment criterion. 
So far as the contract employees of API, the services of seven contractual employees were regularized including the driver. After his services were terminated, driver Zulqarnain approached the FST where it was revealed that his services were terminated through a verbal order in the month of July 2012. 
The driver initially filed a departmental appeal on July 31, 2012 that was rejected by the API on Jan 4, 2019. As a last resort, the driver approached to the FST. 
Justice Mazhar observed in his judgement that the verbal termination order was ‘illegal’, hence the FST rightly set aside the termination order with the directions to the petitioners to reinstate the driver with back benefits and also dealt with the intervening period aptly. 
According to the judgement, the verbal termination order is against the principle of natural justice that turn of phrase was originated from the Roman word ‘Jus Naturale’, which means principles and moralities of natural law, justice, equity, and good conscience that, is fervently and exuberantly founded in the judicial conscience. 
It is an elementary rule of law that before taking any adverse action, the affected party must be given a fair opportunity to respond and defend the action. This principle does not lay down any differentiation or inequality between a quasi-judicial function and or an administrative function/action for applying evenly and uniformly to secure justice and prevent miscarriage of justice, Justice Mazhar observed. 
Before taking any punitive or adverse action, putting to end the services of any employee/workman or civil servant, the precept of fairness and reasonableness commands that an even-handed opportunity to put forth the defence should be afforded. 
Due to negligent and unprofessional practice or conduct of issuing verbal termination orders of service, the action of employer is often defeated and non-suited in the court of law without touching the merits of the case despite having sometimes valid grounds for termination of service, the judgement said, adding that in order to avoid such anomalies and eventualities, even in the case of contractual or temporary engagements, the employees should be issued appointment letters in writing with the terms and conditions of engagement and in the case of termination, explicit reasons of termination should be assigned.",Pakistan
"Ex-husband confesses to killing US national: Rawalpindi police
","December 26, 2021","RAWALPINDI: A 29-year-old man has confessed to killing his former wife, an American national of Pakistani origin, and burying her body in Lakki Marwat, disclosed Rawalpindi City Police Officer (CPO) Sajid Kiani on Saturday.  
While addressing a press conference, the police chief said suspect Rizwan Habib Bangash had murdered his ex-wife Wajiha Farooq Swati, 47, after kidnapping her and shifted the corpse to Lakki Marwat where he buried it in a room of his servant’s house in the Peezo area. 
SSP (Investigations) Syed Ghazan­far Ali Shah and SP (Potohar Division) Rana Abdul Wahab were also present at the presser.  
Sharing motive for the murder, the CPO said it emerged that she had been demanding back her property worth millions of rupees, which she had transferred in the name of Rizwan before their divorce. The police chief told the media that the police had recovered the body from the house in Lakki Marwat on the basis of information provided by the killer himself. 
The police chief said the body was being shifted to Rawalpindi. “Since the man killed the woman in Rawalpindi, the body will be brought to District Headquarters Hospital for a post-mortem examination after which it will be handed over to her heirs for burial,” CPO Kiani said.  
The police also arrested the father and servant of the suspect on charges of aiding and abetting the murder. The CPO said police investigators visited several cities to collect evidence and grill suspects during the course of investigation. “Police used latest technology and human intelligence to solve the high-profile murder case,” he said.  
In all, four special investigation teams had been formed under the supervision of SSP (Investigations) Shah to solve the case, he said.  
Mr Kiani said the US embassy was also in contact with him. He urged the media to refrain from relying on ‘unverified’ information about the case as investigation was still under way. The police would soon arrest other suspects in the case, he claimed.  
“We will share all details with the media once the investigations are completed,” CPO Kiani said.  
The body of the Pakistani American was exhumed from the Wargher locality of Darra Peezu town in Lakki Marwat district on Saturday.

He said the police had to dig the concrete floor to disinter the body. “The body was later handed over to the Rawalpindi police,” he claimed.  ",Pakistan
"Ministry delays pact signing with power firms
","December 26, 2021","LAHORE: Following grave concerns expressed by the Boards of Directors (BoDs) and fearing resistance during a scheduled meeting, the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) has delayed signing of agreements among the Power Planning and Monitoring Company (PPMC), all power distribution and generation companies (Discos and Gencos) and the National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC).  
The Power Division also started reviewing the agreements under which the affairs of Discos and NTDC are to be controlled by the PPMC, formerly known as the Pakistan Electric Power Company (Pepco), 
 learnt on Saturday. 
“The Power Division had invited CEOs/MDs of all Discos and NTDC to a meeting scheduled on Dec 22. During the meeting, the CEOs/MDs were supposed to sign agreements for a period of 10 years on behalf of their organisations and BoDs with the PPMC. However, suddenly on Dec 21 evening, the ministry postponed the meeting after it received a negative feedback from some of the BoDs on various clauses of the agreements that fully empower the PPMC to rule Discos, Gencos and NTDC,” an official source told 
. 
“There are also reports that the CEOs/MDs of various companies have been advised by their respective BoDs to not attend the meeting. [The head were told that] if any pressure is mounted by the ministry to attend the meeting, they must avoid signing the agreements,” the official requesting anonymity claimed. 
According another official source, the autonomous bodies/organisations such as companies, authorities, etc, under the Corporate Governance Rules, are supposed to be governed independently since they have their own BoDs having representation of public and private departments concerned. 
“Therefore, the formation of PPMC after dissolving Pepco to monitor and intervene into the affairs of Discos, Gencos and NTDC is absolutely wrong and unjustified,” he added. 
The ministry, on the other hand, says the dynamics of the power sector require dedicated institutional capacity for providing support to the government in development of policies, strategic plans, frameworks, cross-sectoral and cross value chain integration and performance monitoring and reporting on strategic initiatives. 
Under its various functions, the PPMC would continue to charge a fee to Discos, Gencos and NTDC as determined by its BoD from time to time. 
“In pursuance of these decisions, all boards of Discos, Gencos and NTDC are required to comply with the planning and monitoring agreement with PPMC along with authorising the respective CEO/MD to the sign the same. The signing of agreements between PPMC and All Discos, Gencos and NTDC would be held on December 22 at 11am in the committee room of Power Division, Islamabad,” read a recent letter from the Power Division sent to the Discos, Gencos and NTDC.",Newspaper

","December 26, 2021","KARACHI: It was only the second over and defending champions Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were reeling in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy final. 
Northern pacer Waqas Ahmed was getting early afternoon swing at the National Stadium on Saturday and uprooted Fakhar Zaman’s off-stump with a delivery that swung back into the left-hander.
The very next ball, Sahibzada Farhan was trapped lbw with a delivery that swung late and Waqas was on a hat-trick with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa at 6-2.

"Hong Kong police make record 1.3 tonne ketamine bust
","December 26, 2021","HONG KONG: A haul of ketamine worth over $100 million has been seized by Hong Kong officials, police said on Saturday.
The record-breaking 1.3 tonnes of the drug, valued at around HK$840 million ($108 million), is the largest bust of its kind in the city’s history.
Travel restrictions related to Covid-19 have forced smugglers to make risker bulk shipments instead of using drug mules travelling through airports, police said.
On Friday morning, officers intercepted the narcotics as they were being offloaded from a speedboat in the seaside Lei Yue Mun district.
“Drug trafficking syndicates would use fishing boats or oceangoing vessels to transport the drugs to the high seas near Hong Kong waters. Then they will arrange speedboats to smuggle the drugs to shore,” Chief Inspector Ip Sau-lan said at a press conference.
Three local men and a man of Indian nationality, aged between 32 and 47, were arrested and remain in custody.
Police said the investigation is ongoing and would not rule out further arrests.
Traffickers will likely continue to smuggle drugs in bulk if Hong Kong maintains its pandemic-related travel restrictions, police added.",Newspaper
"CDA issues two notices to Pak-EPA as differences over road project persist
","December 26, 2021","ISLAMABAD: In a tit-for-tat move against Pakistan Environment Protection Agency (Pak-Epa)’s direction to stop work on Margalla Avenue, the Capital Development Authority (CDA) has issued two notices to the environment watchdog asking it to bring its building under conforming use and remove encroachment from an adjacent plot.
According to the EPA, Margalla Avenue was being constructed without an environment impact assessment (EIA). Besides, a portion of the road also passes through Margalla Hills National Park.
The CDA earlier termed the environment body’s order illegal, stating that the road was being constructed in accordance with Islamabad’s master plan of 1960 and under the CDA ordinance the agency can’t direct the civic agency to stop the work.
When both the organisations were at loggerhead, the civic agency issued the notices, pointing out that the EPA was an encroacher as it had occupied an adjacent plot of the CDA by constructing rooms and planting trees there.
One of the notices issued by the building control section said a building meant for research and training centre was being used as offices of the EPA.
The notice said a firefighting system had also not been installed in the building as per the CDA standards.
Meanwhile, another notice issued by the director land said: “Environment Research Training Centre under the administrative control of the Ministry of Climate Change is an encroachment on Plot No 41, Sector H-8/2.”
The plot was a public property and the encroachment would be removed under Section 4,5,6,7 and 8 of the Building Control Regulations 2020, the notice said, adding the encroachment was a serious violation of the Public Properties (Removal of Encroachment) Ordinance 2021.
“You are hereby issued a show-cause notice under Section 3 of the ordinance to remove the encroachment within seven days of the issuance of this notice. If you failed to remove the encroachment, the cost of demolition and removal of structure will be recovered from the unauthorised occupant of the structure under Section 6 of the ordinance,” the notice said.
On the other hand, CDA officials alleged that the EPA was creating hurdles in completion of the Margalla Road by raising unnecessary questions which did not fall in its jurisdiction.
When contacted, a senior officer of the EPA wishing not to be named said the agency’s notice to the CDA on Margalla Road construction was justified and in accordance with rules and regulations. The officer said the CDA can’t construct a road without an EIA.
About the notices issued by the CDA, the officer said EPA would respond to them.
“We have not committed any violation. The research and training centre requires offices and we set up offices in accordance with rules and regulations,” the officer said. “As far as encroachment on the adjacent plot is concerned, we did not encroach on it rather have planted trees there. Some structure like a room was already constructed there by a contractor,” the officer said.",Pakistan
"PTI to learn from local bodies elections’ defeat in KP: minister
","December 26, 2021","TAXILA: Federal Minister for Aviation Ghulam Sarwar Khan on Saturday admitted that the PTI would learn from the defeat in local government elections in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and would repeat mistakes in Punjab.
He was talking to newsmen after performing inauguration of Sangjani-Paswal road rehabilitation project which would be completed at the cost of Rs700 million during the current fiscal year.
The minister, however, added that results had exposed the PML-N and PPP and they were restricted to Punjab and Sindh. The majority of seats in KP have won by Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F).
He said that PTI government had ensured transparent, free and fair elections in the province and contested polls without the support of other political parties and local pressure groups. He claimed that the ruling PTI had emerged as the lone political power of the country.
The minister announced that Prime Minister Imran Khan would perform the ground breaking ceremony of the Rawalpindi Ring Road project and Naya Pakistan Housing project in Sangjani next month. After completion the two projects would boost economic and trade activities in the region.
He said Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) on Wednesday approved the Rawalpindi Ring Road project which includes a main carriageway from Baanth (N-5) to Thallian (M-2) at a cost of Rs23.6 billion on the condition that the Planning Commission’s consent will be sought and the axle load management regime will be included in the project.
He said the project would be financed under the provincial Annual Development Programme (ADP) while the Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA) will execute the construction of the 38.3 km six lane access-controlled ring road.
He further said the present government was planning to construct over 2,000 housing units on the government land located in Sangjani area under Naya Pakistan Housing Project (NPHP) to facilitate the low-income citizens.
Member National Assembly Mansoor Hayat Khan and member Punjab Assembly Ammar Sadeeq Khan also spoke on this occasion.

"EPA without permanent chief, policymaking body
","December 26, 2021","PESHAWAR: At a time when the climate-related threats are multiplying across the region, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) faces a near meltdown and is unable to perform its regulatory duties as the environmental watchdog.
The EPA is currently rudderless without a permanent director general and Environmental Protection Council, which is responsible for framing environmental related policies for the implementation of provincial environmental quality standards.
The provincial government recently removed the DG and assigned the office to a non-technical person (a bureaucrat).
The council has not held a single meeting since the promulgation of the Environmental Protection Act, 2014.
Under the act, chief minister is the chairperson of the 18-memebr council.
According to officials, the maiden meeting of the council was convened in Oct 2020.
Chief Minister Mahmood Khan had asked environment minister Syed Ishtiaq Urmar, who serves as the co-chairperson of the council to preside over the meeting in his absence. The government has so far only notified members of the council.
“All of a sudden, the then chief secretary cancelled the meeting although he (CS) has no powers either to call or cancel the meeting,” revealed an official.
He said that under the law, the government would notify district environmental protection councils across the province. The council will approve environmental policies and EPA will act as an executing body to implement policies and guidelines.
The act says that the council shall hold meetings, as and when necessary, but at least one meeting shall be held in a year and its main functions are approval of comprehensive environmental policies, action plans and ensure their implementation and approval of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Environmental Quality Standards.
Established in 1989, the EPA was placed under the environment department in 2001. According to the act, the authority’s main objectives are to protect, conserve, rehabilitate and improve environment, control pollution and promote sustainable development in the province.
From an agency that enjoyed much prominence in the provincial scheme of things in 1990s due to focus on environmental issues, the EPA figures nowhere in terms of relevance today as funds dwindle alongside interest of the bureaucracy as well as the government in improving its performance and impact.
Officials told 
 that the authority was dormant due to multiple reasons.
According to the act, the EPA shall publish annual environmental report on the state of the environment in the province, but no report has so far been compiled. Instead of publishing annual report, the EPA launched the environmental profile of the province in 2018.
Sources said that the government had allocated Rs15 million for the authority in the 2020-21 annual development programme to publish the second environmental profile but the task was not accomplished and therefore, the funds lapsed.
On the other hand, air quality monitoring equipment donated by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), which was installed on the rooftop of the EPA building, is out of order.
Sources said the equipment repair costs totaled Rs2.4 million.
“The EPA is unable to monitor air quality of Peshawar and only updates about the provincial capital air quality are available from a small station installed at foreign diplomatic mission,” said one source.
He said that a few years ago, the foreign mission had offered to donate the air quality monitoring machine to the EPA, but the offer was turned down for security reasons.
“Currently, the EPA needs at least four mobile stations to check air quality on daily basis in Peshawar,” he said.
Sources said that the EPA soil, air and water lab had been set up in Sherabad area on the outskirts of the city adjacent to Mohmand tribal district.
They said that the lab couldn’t function regularly as the area remained without power supply for hours due to the prolonged loadshedding.
The sources said that the authority had decided to shift the lab to the Pakistan Forest Institute located on the University Campus and allocated space for it.
A senior official told 
 requesting anonymity that the authority was faced with many issues.
He, however, said efforts were under way to revive the EPA.
The official said the authority would begin air quality monitoring next week from the Hayatabad industrial estate, while mobile teams would start visiting Hayatabad industrial estate and serve notices on polluters on the spot.
He said steps were being taken to expedite environmental impact assessment for industrial units.
“We will formally ask the chief minister to chair the Council meeting after the authority makes some progress,” he said.",Pakistan
"South African anti-apartheid campaigner Archbishop Tutu dies aged 90
","December 26, 2021","Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and veteran of South Africa's struggle against white minority rule died on Sunday at the age of 90, the presidency said.
In 1984, Desmond Tutu won the Nobel Peace Prize for his non-violent opposition to apartheid. A decade later, he witnessed the ends of that regime and he chaired a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, set up to unearth atrocities committed during those dark days.
The outspoken Tutu was considered the nation's conscience by both black and white, an enduring testament to his faith and spirit of reconciliation in a divided nation.
He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in the late 1990s and in recent years, was hospitalised on several occasions to treat infections associated with his cancer treatment.
“The passing of Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu is another chapter of bereavement in our nation's farewell to a generation of outstanding South Africans who have bequeathed us a liberated South Africa,” President Cyril Ramaphosa said.
“Desmond Tutu was a patriot without equal.” The presidency gave no details on the cause of death.
Tutu preached against the tyranny of the white minority but even after its end, never wavered in his fight for a fairer South Africa, calling the black political elite to account with as much feistiness as he had the white Afrikaners.
In his final years, he regretted that his 
 had yet to come true.
“Ultimately, at the age of 90, he died peacefully at the Oasis Frail Care Centre in Cape Town this morning,” Dr Ramphela Mamphele, acting chairperson of the Archbishop Desmond Tutu IP Trust and Coordinator of the Office of the Archbishop, said in a statement on behalf of the Tutu family.
A frail-looking Tutu was seen in October being wheeled into his former parish at St George's Cathedral in Cape Town, which used to be a safe haven for anti-apartheid activists, for a special thanksgiving service marking his 90th birthday.
Dubbed “the moral compass of the nation”, his courage in defending social justice, even at great cost to himself, 
 and not just during apartheid. He often fell out with his erstwhile allies at the ruling African National Congress party over their failures to address the poverty and inequalities that they promised to eradicate.
Just five feet five inches (1.68 metres) tall and with an infectious giggle, Tutu helped rouse grassroots campaigns around the world that fought for an end to apartheid through economic and cultural boycotts.
Talking and travelling tirelessly throughout the 1980s, he became the face of the anti-apartheid movement abroad while many of the leaders of the rebel ANC, such as Nelson Mandela, were behind bars.
Tributes poured in from around the world.
The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby hailed Tutu on Twitter, saying he “was a prophet and priest, a man of words and action” while flamboyant British billionaire Richard Branson said in a blog post: ""The world has lost a giant. He was a brave leader, a mischievous delight, a profound thinker, and a dear friend.” 
Tutu led numerous marches and campaigns to end apartheid from St George's front steps, which became known as the “People's Cathedral” and a powerful symbol of democracy.
He was a long-time friend of Mandela, and the pair lived for a time on the same street in the South African township of Soweto, making Vilakazi Street the only one in the world to host two Nobel Peace Prize winners.
“His most characteristic quality is his readiness to take unpopular positions without fear,” Mandela once said of Tutu. “Such independence of mind is vital to a thriving democracy.” 
At a Boxing Day service at St Georges, there were only a handful of congregants to hear the news of Tutu's death in a brief homage by the Very Reverend Michael Weeder, who spoke from the Archbishop's former pulpit, saying it was once the celebrated point of command before asking parishioners to bow their heads in a moment of silence.
“It is sad, but he was old and served his country very well and it's a very painful loss at a time when there is a leadership crisis in the country and the world,"" said Ntokozo Mjiyako, a 39-year-old lawyer taking an early morning stroll in Cape Town. ",World
"'Back to me in a coffin': Bodies of migrants drowned in English Channel repatriated to Iraq
","December 26, 2021","The bodies of 16 Iraqi Kurdish migrants who drowned last month as they attempted to cross the English Channel were repatriated to northern Iraq on Sunday.
The 
, in which 27 migrants died, has been described as the worst on record involving migrants trying to cross the perilous passage to Britain from France. The boat capsized off the coast of northern France, sparking a political crisis. 
Britain and France accused each other of not doing enough to deter people from crossing the English Channel.
Dozens of mourners waited at the semi-autonomous Kurdish regions international airport in Irbil Sunday, where the plane carrying the bodies arrived. Relatives grieved as the caskets were transported by ambulance to their hometowns for burial.
The repatriations came amid a new tragedy involving migrants from the Middle East searching for new lives in Europe. Libya's Red Crescent said on Sunday that at least 27 bodies of Europe-bound migrants, including a baby and two women, have 
 in the country's west.
A disproportionate number of migrants from the Middle East attempting to reach Europe lately have been people from Iraq's Kurdish region. Although northern Iraq is more prosperous than the rest of the conflict-scarred country, growing unemployment and frustration over corruption is forcing many to consider the risky journey.
			
Among the bodies returned on Sunday was that of 24-year-old Maryam Nouri, called Baran by her friends and family. She perished during the ill-fated, illicit voyage across the English Channel with hopes of reuniting with her fiance in Britain. The flimsy boat sank a few miles (kilometres) from the French coast. 
At least 27 migrants bound for Britain drowned. France's interior minister called it the biggest migration tragedy involving the crossing to date.
“The last time I heard my son's voice was when he got on board the boat. He said 'Don't worry Mum, I will reach England shortly.' Now he's back to me in a coffin,” said Shukriya Bakir, whose son was one of those who drowned. 
Other bodies included those of Shakar Ali, Sarkawt Pirot and Avrasiya Ahmad, who came from the Ranya district of the Sulaymaniyah governorate in the Kurdish-run region of Iraq.
Hundreds of family members and friends attended a ceremony in the town to pay their last respects.
Relatives said the three had tried to make it to a better life in Europe as they had been unable to find employment in Iraq.
Shakar Ali graduated from the oil department in geology college, which is a much needed department for this country. ""But unfortunately, after many attempts — and we even paid money to people to get him a job, but he couldn't get one,” said his brother, Haval Ali.
“Many of his colleagues, those with connections, got jobs, except my brother ... so he decided to migrate abroad.""",World
"41 killed in Burkina Faso ambush including volunteer leader
","December 26, 2021","Militants killed 41 people last week in an attack in northern Burkina Faso, including the prominent leader of a volunteer group helping the country's military, the government said.
Alkassoum Maiga, the government spokesman, announced two days of mourning following the deadly ambush on a convoy in Loroum province on Thursday.
Among the victims was Soumaila Ganame, also known as Ladji Yoro. Burkina Faso's President Roch Marc Christian Kabore said Ganame had died for his country and must be a model of our determined commitment to fight the enemy.
""The death of Burkina Faso's most important volunteer leader has created a sense of panic,"" said Heni Nsaibia, a senior researcher at the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project.
While Ganame achieved legendary status as a popular counter-insurgent who played a central role in mobilising (volunteers) in Loroum and Yatenga, he was also the embodiment of the absent state,"" he said.
Violence in the once-peaceful West African nation is escalating as attacks linked to al-Qaeda and the Islamic State increase. 
More than 50 gendarmes were killed in November in the largest attack on the country's security forces in recent memory and at least 160 civilians were massacred in the Sahel region in June.
""Even though Burkina Faso's security forces are conducting the most operations compared to its neighbours in the volatile Sahel region, the army is overstretched, putting out one fire at a time,"" Nsaibia said.
Volunteer fighters have been accused of committing some human rights abuses against those suspected of fighting with the jihadis, but also have become the targets of attacks.
The government is facing calls to step down amid its inability to stop the violence, with weeks of protests taking place in November. 
In response, the president fired his prime minister this month. ",World
